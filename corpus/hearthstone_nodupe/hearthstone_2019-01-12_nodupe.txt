Miss most will be Radiant Elemental and Quests for Mage and Priest. I actually only have combo decks. Also, Minstrel and Kobold Illusionist will suck losing. 
---

---
I hate Hunter because of its fast nature so all the good hunter support cards leaving will be nice. 
---
---
---
You should know where to play a card by looking at the screen dumbass
---
Yeah, because even the minor cards like pact, taldaram, umbra, lackey, defile, they will all be history. I don't even know what he is supposed to copy with faceless
---
why is this downvoted when it’s true
---
What happened to the totem? Did you flood board so your totem had no space?
---
congrats!!  First 12 wins is super exciting, and nerve wracking
---
how many 11 wins did u get before this point?

coldlight wasn't in practically every deck. the reason they hof'd coldlight was because they didnt like neutral mill.
---
We're not saying they are disabled, just saying that the game could make the interface easier for them to use
---
Lots of lefties said it was easy, all they just had to do was doing this or that with their hands in positions that for me seem uncomfortable and I know I don't have to do these things because the interface favors me, just mirroring it is not that deal even for a small indie company
---
Is not like they can't play hearthstone or doing other things, but forcing them to adapt for things that are clearly not made thinking that they exist is really ridiculous
---
I'm most happy to see Spreading Plague go. There aren't many worse feelings in the game than your opponent's Spreading Plague completely turning a game around. 
---
The only answer
---
From what I remembered my opponent killed my whole board and then the snake triggered (which activated 3x) then the totem was gone. I still don’t know how I did it.
---
hunter spellstone. FUCK hunter
---
When you have a full board totem disappears 
---
Turn 7 Dr. Boom -&gt; BGH
---
Turn 8 Rag -&gt; Mind control
---
Turn 9 Sylvanas + shield slam -&gt; Mind control
---
Turn 10 Deathwing -&gt; Power Word Death
---
Turn 11 Esc+Concede -&gt; Well played
---
Are you a bot? You seem like a bot there's bots everywhere these days!!
---
And that’s actually really important since it acts as a check on extremely greedy decks that seek to maximize late game value or against combo decks that are dependent on stacking combo pieces in hand for several turns.
---
Wont miss Deathstalker Rexxar. My dear Malygos Rogue, though...
---
I'm not sure that makes for a very fun experience, tbh.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Eh, I don't get much of the card hate.  I get annoyed when I see the same card too often, but understand that's just an effect of repetition. If I had to say an individual card happy, it'd be Gul'Dan for the above reason. 
---
too confusing to new players 
---
Blizzard has literally said directly that Stonetusk Boar is possibly the single most design limiting card.
---
Nothing of higher regard, comrade
---
The only way they would clutter up the store is if they are as incompetent as everyone thinks they are. [Remember how they had a different tab for adventures?](https://i.imgur.com/AMiDPml.jpg) Look at that, just add a wild store there and have it default to standard whenever you open the store. Problem solved.
---
Amazing how people jump on to defend a multi billion dollar company from consumer who want something.

I agree with every point you made here. Especially the part about Wild not being a dumping ground, ever since they did it to Molten Giant people think it's a good idea for any nerfed card.
---
Also wish Ancient of Lore was un-nerfed (or made a little better) just because I really love the flexibility choose one cards in Druid and there just aren't that many good ones anymore.
---
Nobody else has been pointed this out yet, but strictly inferior cards play a role in balancing effects that create random minions (not least of all drafting game modes like arena).
---
You should look up that article about weak cards in MtG.
---
13-3 with Mech Mage, that got boring pretty quickly.
---
Suggestions for interface updates for hearthstone? Lmao
---
Odd warrior, even shaman and probs odd rouge
---
Hmm seems to be a glitch on your screen where all the card text is also in Russian. Now I find Russian hard to read so I’d change it to English and see if that helps 
---
Miss most: Fire Fly, Lesser Jasper, Candleshot, Lich King, Wandering Monster, Sunkeeper Tarim, Unstable Evolution, Shadow Visions 
---
Won't Miss: DKs (especial Gul'dan, Jaina, and Rexxar, but in a good way), Voidlord, Obsidian Statue, Meteor, Volcano, Prince Keleseth, Psychic Scream, Duskbreaker, Spreading Plague, Ultimate Infestation, Hadronox, Carnivorous Cube, and Kingsbane.
---
FUCK those cards.
---
I don’t recommend the pure control, rather the Mind Blast Priest.
---
The people downvoting you probably have no idea how to code. This is not a hard problem to solve, just an insignificant one
---
I fight 3 times more paladins than I do hunters
---
Nope, just you lagging out and not reacting fast enough to start playing again
---
Sorry. 
---
I mean I haven’t coded it so it may be super quick. But yeah I just feel like it’s mostly either it hasn’t been thought about *or* it’s something they don’t think will see a return for. Just kinda playing devils advocate. 
---
I would highly recommend the sister sub, competitivehs, they are a great help to people who want to improve!
---
Should probably offer less deck slots to be honest.
---
Yes, but Zul'jin is not just a finisher, he's for developeling a board. It's rare you hold onto Zul'jin for more than a turn (after you hit 10 mana).
---
Discord does that to me too
---
*(whenever it is)*
---
Nope now looking at it brann was free, so I got triple emperor off of drakkari enhancer, and getting a second emperor from hex Lord. There are like 20 different ways to get the combo off the way my deck is built. I can hit you with the list if you like. 
---
Use the pinky finger
---
Maybe Blizzard should pay you to play the game, instead?
---
are lefties totally superior bc thes can upvote with their thumbs?
---
It also loses Anduin and Visions which takes it wincon from reliably being 19 burst to a measly 10 barring luck from firetree. That knocks the deck down more than enough to take it out of the picture without some significant reinventing or new cards.
---
Trading the quest. NA, Battletag mmmmmkkay#1550
---
I wouldnt talk about fault, it was a friendly game, we are just having fun. And before this I had to use a desperation blastwave on my own fireflies to get cards. This is just celebrating my spectacular topdeck luck.

---
Paladin has Pyromancer Equality Combo and Consecration
---
Warrior has Brawl, Reckless Flurry, Warpath and to a lesser extent Blood Razor and Supercollider
---
Priest has Mass Hysteria, Psychic Scream, Shadow Visions, Duskbreaker and the annoying Mass Dispel (not a board clear tho)
---
Mage has Dragon's Fury, Blizzard, Meteor, Flamestrike, Blast Wave
---
Warlock has Defile, Hellfire, Lord Godfrey, Twisting Nether
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Nope, you can actually see what happens next in the link I commented below
---
Generally the correct play with that deck is a 1-drop on turn 1, then quest and another 1-drop on turn 2.
---
Nice arguments, buddy. 
---
This is the kind of quality post this sub has been talking about lacking lately 
---
Every single DK
---
I'm talking post rotation. Most of those rotate 
---
Probably. Everyone except you calls those dailies.
---
I’m left handed and don’t find this an issue. 
---
Mage, Paladin, Warlock can all make decks with more than 2 board clears post rotation easily. I didn't try any other classes though I suspect they're a little more difficult. Mage has Blizz/Flamestrike for an easy 4 with other options like Blast Wave existing. Pally has 2 Equalities and 2 Shrink Rays to clear with using Pyro, Cons, Avenging Wrath or something else. They can also use Pyro+Sound the Bells. Warlock has Hellfire and Godfrey for an easy 3 plus the option of running Twisting Nether or even Shadowflame in some decks.
---
I literally answered every single question you asked me and explained my answers each time, giving examples.
---
Like actually fucking kill yourself, holy shit.
---
RACISTS!!
---
basically the only difference between rank 15 and legend is the amount of time spent playing the game competitively. 
---
There are so many cards that are playable in Wild yet so few that actually see regular play it would be better if there was a curated set containing the say one-hundred-fifty to two-hundred most relevant cards to Wild that aren't Standard Legal.
---
If you had to do the change yourself, choose one:
---
-move items to your non-dominant hand for mobile device use.
---
-add programming parameters that change orientation of assets (turn recap) and default image display on highlight.
---
Hmmmmmm
---
No ya goofy goober
---
Quest Warrior is already this, pretty much. Against aggro you often mulligan fire plume's heart away since you can win more easily without it.
---
did he play something else for 1 mana?
---
absolutely agree!  i bet it'll be announced at the next rotation^^
---
The rewards for rank 5 is as good as the reward for legend. But yeah, laddering from 5 to legend is by far the hardest. 
---
How do you not go crazy with those notifications
---
Funny, that's what your dad said to your mother when you were 12.
---
*(whyever it will be)*
---
Inb4 REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE HUNTER GOOD AND I DONT KNOW HOW TO COUNTER REEEEEEEEEE 
---
Almost always, when I collect a deck it seems to me that pulls on 12 wins! Unfortunately, I only did a few times 11 wins(
---
And that is a promise ;)
---
How many of your losses did you draw cairne?
---
Or Rockbiter on a Doomhammer.  Or lightning storm.  Lava Burst turns into a cheap pyroblast.  There are still a few good options.
---
*every r/hearthstone user* REEEEEEE LATE like seriously what are you an iFunny user?
---
Cant complain about losing to a class all the time if you play garbage yourself.
---
[removed]
---
Business.  No pressure to buy tickets or packs means progression (quests) in them will be limited to non-existent.  Personally I wish they would make some hybrid PvP-crafting mechanic in them or heroic (ticket) modes for them and enable questing at the same time.
---
I like going face though.
---
Please.. Stop posting about this interaction.. There's been atleast a hundred posts about it. 
---
That works as intended. Did you know that Blizzard programmed that the reverse would never happen? That if you were playing the Paladin shrine that deals damage whenever your hero takes damage, your Warlock opponent will never get the shrine that reflects damage back to you. So they know the interaction.
---
Thanks for the silver! :)
---
First off I don’t mean to talk shit or anything I agree rexxar should be absolutely 10 cost. The insane (essentially infinite) amount of value build a beast is for 6 mana is ridiculous. Keleseth is definitely annoying but too be honest every deck that was built to deal with Aggro decks could still do it even with the 1/1 buff on everything.

Congrats and welcome to the club 😊
---
Definitely not.
---
Leeroy isn't really much of an issue now that he's at 5 mana.
---
Alexstrasza I kind of doubt as well.  it can certainly be strong, but it's only really seeing play in one deck at the moment.
---
Poor topping choice, but as a serious pizza lover this will be my card back forever.
---
Why leeroy?
---
You do see that it's talking about Hall of Faming and not nerfing things, right?

I don't see why people would want a bad option that badly, but I guess if people want to flush gold down the toilet who am I to judge.

Yeah dawg. Diablo Immortal and Command and Conquer: Rivals

The brown page indicates that all sets are being shown.

---
Not that similar, people just never really thought about it very much, that card was obviously busted in hindsight whereas I can understand Supercollider not being seen as strong a lot more as it's more nuanced and deck dependant.

BS just hold one finger from the bottom like normal people not your entire hand from the left and you'll be able to see!
---
They can still stop printing such stupid combo cards. I agree aggro is vital (although that doesn't necessarily mean Leeroy is) but I just don't get why they make cards like Mecha'thun, that card is just unfun. Combo should be stuff like Hadronox Druid or something, not uninteractable instawins.
---
That was probably made back when shamanstone was a thing and having a a 3/3 and a 3/4 on turn two was the expected play.  This is crazy, but its a lot of cards be g tied up into something that technically could be straight bodied here by sap or hex (oh right, remember when hex cost 3?).  
---
Funny as it was the first time, I hoped that when people write an unironic thread, they get somewhat serious answers.
---
Druid competitive LUL
---
I agree it's stupid to say that, but I think Prep is clearly retarded. Innervate got nerfed ages ago, why is Prep still a fucking 3 mana discount?
---
Instead of relying on matchup rng record your games (hstracker is a nifty tool) and review your decisions and try to find more optimal plays. Fastest way of spotting mistakes and weaknesses. Your game will improve and hunters will be less of an issue.
---
I’ve played since beta and have Zero 12 win runs. Let people have their experience, Jesus Christ. 
---
No way they reprint something as monstrous as spellstone for hunter anytime soon.  That was a hard pushed card and right now they are probably in back peddle mode for hunter stuff now.  
---
But yea, the power level is going to straight CRASH on a lot of things.  No deathknights alone would shift things a lot.  
---
I don’t know what you did to rumble run. But your so call balance is doing nothing. Zentimo, war master voone and zul’jin are still the same cheesy and stupid AF shit pre-patch.
---
I love how left handed people are supposed to be more intelligent, yet, not intelligent enough to use their right hand. 
---
Leftie btw, and I use a clenched fist with my middle finger, so I can swear at myself with every move I make. 
---
Un'goro introduced a retarded amount of overtuned taunts and removal, resulting in an Arena control meta. In Ctrl vs Ctrl, the greediest deck will win. However, greed doesn't fare well against flappy bird. People preferred just picking the largest card everytime, rather than caring about the early game.
---
i meant fast warrior decks in general even stuff like old dragon warrior.
---
Yeah, card games need such a high i/o that everyone should be required to install them on a ssd /s
---
Then again, if you worked 12+ hours a day you could get the cards even faster without cursing at the game's rng
---

Dont waste your silence/removal for the first hoppers, try to deal with them as long as you can, even if that means taking 7 face damage etc
---
If you play on EU you can add me: Mint#2174. From my experience there are so many things a new player could ask, reddit threads wont cut it long term.

---
*Ein Murloc* is coming for you.
---
I've just realized I've been playing hearthstone with my right hand all my life
---
I think buying the wild packs for real money is only really worth it for the 10 packs pity timer (even the wild bundle that you can buy now is exactly 10 packs). If you could buy them for gold, i guess a lot of people would just buy them 1 by 1 for 100 gold until they get a legendary. They would get a lot less people buying the packs (in the form of bundle or not) and blizzard is greedy, so they won't do it.
---
Happened to me once, i will never do the same mistake again.
---
I don't think Elise is ever right here. I'd only pick Elise if it was Kate in the draft and I hadn't managed to draft enough late game. 
---
Fun fact: doomcaller doesnt put cthun back in your deck, it puts a copy of cthun (assuming ones died) into your deck. 
---
It's not. Especially if you are already left handed and have to use your right hand
---
Source: Left handed 
---
It has to consider the width of the content being displayed so objects of different width can work with the same code.
---
The X position is probably something like X - this.width/2 - offset (assuming it's centered). So you have to use an if statement there to instead use X + this.width/2 + offset when leftie is true.
---
No, you can't just add positions. Yes, it is very easy and quick to do.
---
I really like the concept, but this week’s brawl proves to me that you can never remove the classic/basic set from constructed and have a diverse meta. **Every** matchup is mech focused.
---
Thaurissan tick will do it, and yes 4 KTs. Or you could summon him with ancestors call or eureka.
---
Watching him playing Topsy Turvy Priest is one of the most mesmerizing hearthstone things to see.
---
Geting all cards by buying packs is around 3000 Euros at the moment, starting from zero. If you want to keep up during the year you have to spend 70 Euros a month (840 Euros a year). I'm thinking about this a lot, but actually it's too expensive.
---
I know, I'm saying I don't understand what the hell he means. "0.5 out of 5 is 10%"?? What?
---
Or just use the sidebar?
---
But then you'd use the 100 gold proceeds toward another arena run
---
Not too bad actually. No secrets and lots of compound value. Yeah, you'd rather have 8 Poly's, but it could be much worse.
---
Does this work on all blizz games?
---
What's your point? Obviously these decks won't exist without their most important cards. Except Odd Pally, as it can just throw in anything and work. 
---
I just popped the wild bundle, and got both my until now missing nerf-disenchanted legendaries: Aviana and Raza. Also got a decent amount of extras, so Now I can craft the missing epics from the last two sets and still have 14k dust in the bank - and a lot of Goldens left over if I really need some dust.
---
Thanks for your helpful and worthwhile reply :)
---
I haven't dusted all my wild collections, I had simply quit hearthstone for last two years and recently came back. Naturally, I have no cards from those sets. 
---
Np
---
Best answer. 
---
Well obviously Spell Hunter doesn't rely on DK Rexxar to win the game. You can't possibly tell me you have the time to draw your full deck while also trying to control the board against the countless wolves and To My Side's,and stay alive. 
---
Tbf i have playing on this puzzle site, and it had a left-handed option. And for the life of me i couldnt figure out what it changed or why it would be usefull. This explains
---
Uninstall, you fool! 🧙‍♂️
---
yes we get it, academic espionnage allows you to have turn two DK, stop posting it all the time
---
Sometimes agro gets a ridiculous start (heal zoo, for example) and the game becomes about "that."  But in general, agro vs agro, to me, seems to be more about fighting for board, and even agro vs a reasonable control deck can be about when to hold back on playing minions, or for the control player how to use their removal as resources.  But when you just have a meta full of control vs control, it becomes about who can do the most greedy thing first.  Anyway, just my opinion, certainly doesn't capture all games.
---
its not the quality but the method

---
Idk man if you're Hardware struggles with hearthstone... I've got bad news for ya... 
---
But when Hearthstone esports does come to and end, we know how it will happen and how much warning everyone will get. 
---
And those who are depending on the pro scene for income should be ready to get discarded like trash, because we know that's how blizzard does things now.
---
Seems like a radical leftist idea. But you could be right. The world is ruled by right supremacists.
---
This year could be having. But next year is unpredictable. I've almost never seen a eSports event being "great advertisement". Most people doesn't care HCT events. Only care about actual gameplay is enjoyable.
---
Oh, really? Could've sworn I'd seen that not work in the past, even though that does seem like what the shrine would imply. Thanks for clearing that up.
---
AFAIK You would craft it for 1600 and get 400 back.
---
Only worth it if you play wild and see yourself still using the card.
---
Tbh it doesn't even look that bad to also play like this.

---
Well... yeah that’s garbage right now lol. But you can do alright if you can get yourself to ranks 50-26. Most everyone are budget players too there. Or you can play Arena where all players are on equal playing field when it comes to card access (you have access to all cards there).
---
*ThAtS sOoOo OfFeNsIvE mMkAy*
---
Because he's dumb. There's more than one way to use your hand, he's just creating problems that don't exist to begin with. 
---
But this conversation is about mobile players who are left handed 
---
Only if it were Latin in Origin.  Since Darius was Persian, I wouldn't think so.  More likely Darides?
---
No, the reward of quest warlock is not dormant at all. Its just an untargeteable unit.
---
Sherazin is dormant though, you got that right.
---
Not much worse than Azure Drake in certain cases. Just hope you don't draw the secret before it.
---
Dormant is not a battlecry. Think of it like stealth. Whatever the way you summon it, the minion will have stealth, but wont have its battlecry if not summoned from hand. Its pretty easy to see how it works, but people just confuse dormant as a part of the battlecry when its not.
---
I concur
---
Hey thanks dude!
---
Yeah you should take a better photo next time
---
And I said this wasn't really an issue... You only face problems when: you play on mobile; can't use your right hand; can't close your left hand into a fist to just use 1 finger; desperately need to read what keywords do. 
---
Those are not the Alarm-o-Bots you are looking for!
---
I think the point is if I can farm gold for packs of the next expansion from quests and ladder why are they hamstringing another mode by making it so I can’t there? It is so dumb that you are forced to buy a pack that you don’t necessarily want just to play arena. The mode already has a built in rake anyway.
---
Yes you will get the legendary in those 10 packs guaranteed!
---
“Guys get over here it happened, I’m not lying this guy is literally facing someone with murloc it”
---
You're very stabby today.
---
How many of those standard decks will rotate? How competitive your wild decks are? How long have you been this game? All these questions and many more cannot go unanswered.
---

Hey dude! I am ashamed for many things i've done in my life, but i will never be ashamed to say "i'm sorry" when i could have done it better

I dont know man, he just always has an answer 
---
Nice, thanks for sharing
---
I keep going up against this type of deck so I may as well try it out 
---
Ok, I don't even know what that is supposed to mean. I'm currently in med school so I'm not exactly looking for a job in game development.
---
Thanks for your concern tho.
---
Yeah battle cry shaman is bs because he is coded to always draw keleseth

What are the odds of that? This is a galactic event level of coincidence.

How do you screenshot/record on a computer?

Yes, either of those 2 distinct outcomes.

There's literally a designated button on your keyboard specifically to take Screenshots... 
---
is that really difficult to understand your and you're?

The bots proliferation goes in waves, watch this subreddit for a big post of someone complaining they got banned for "no reason", how they "spend so much" on the game and are saints.

No. No to everything in and about your post. Just no. 
---
The new Expansion lookig good so far
---
What are the odds of receiving 7 of the same legendaries in an arena run, not to mention the odds of picking 7 legendaries at all??
---
Man I really hope you got spirit of rhino, late game can be nuts with 5 Crowley’s 
---
even if you only discount 2 mana worth of spells its till not worth. Most of the time its a dead draw, or a game loser.
---
Hey skip to the last paragraph if you just want to know which packs I think you should get
---
So since no one has responded I'll start a discussion. I also recently came back after a quite long break. I played a lot the first year or so and then got caught up in the big battle royale fever. Anyways I'm back now and as competitive as ever (I'm in college and this fall our school will be in a college eSports league one event being hearthstone)
---
So I came back with a vengeance... 
---
My plan is to be prepared to take the standard ladder by storm the day that the new expansion drops and so below is my preparation for said event.
---
Once I determined that to be my plan I got excited. I bought 80 packs of witchwood and 40 packs of boomsday. I bought zero rumble packs and no other packs.
---
I do however intend to buy more packs. I will probably buy another batch of boomsday. Also I want to get a large number of classic packs before the expansion as I recently realized I don't even have doubles of all the classic rares let alone epics. 
---
The big question though. What to do now while I wait for rotation? I'm just playing/paying arena. Doing this is giving me a competitive environment to practice without worrying about card collection. Meanwhile I'm building my rumble collection and dust pile. Currently my dust is above 7,000 and I've opened some great legendaries such as oondasta and Crowley off the top of my head. 
---
Since I'm aware it is a bit bizarre to do this ( most of the community seems mostly f2p) I've actually started streaming most of my arena runs under the twitch handle functiong
---
This doesn't probably help much but I suppose my advice is to play arena more and buy classic packs as they won't ever leave standard.
---
Hope this helps!
---
You don't have to be so rude
---
what does it do? Too lazy to google
---
That's not that intuitive.
---
we are asking for new game modes like this and tournament game mode since 4 years (beta)

You gotta pump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers!
---
Sorcerers apprentice lowers unstable evolution by 1 which makes unstable free and the minion that allows your spells to target the minion next to it allowed two minions to be upgraded at once instead of 1 by 1
---
DeWitt #2241 EU trade 80g. I can show, you go first.
---
Emerald splash? More like belongs in the trash 
---
high quality smaller text there, well done. 
---
I did notice cube's presence in basically all of the jankiest and most obnoxious combo decks over the past year, duplicating malygos, hadronoxs, doomguards, voidlords, devilsaur eggs, mechano eggs, obsidian statues, etc.  I felt all along that what made most of these minions too good was cube allowing one to duplicate and repeat them.  But this close to rotation they probably wont bother.
---
That card would be very good but not Overpowered to where it shouldn’t be printed. I think it’s something that would be made. It’s barely 2 mana worth of effects on a 1 cost legendary.
---
Yeah, metaltooth leaper is better but you could run both.
---
Now this.... THIS is how mafia works.

Are you fucking kidding me? That's the stupidest shit I've read all year.
---
Is a 3/3 weapon for 3 mana rly strong enough to be put under a condition?
---
of course you choose lower attack to play around betrayal :)
---
I tell ya what... Miracle druid might be pretty bad, But it is a lot of fun. TBH I was playing togwoggle hakkar for a day or two. The worst part about that deck is how unfortunately the cards don't shuffle into the deck until they are finished drawing. So it gets really tough trying to manage armor with how many bloods you have in your deck and then toggling at the right time.
---
That said it's pretty satisfying to pull off.
---
Priests HATE this mage for this one simple trick!! 
---
Nobody plays around the first one, it's not a great card. Having 6 more isn't going to make it any better. 
---
Why does every game have to be an e-sport? Can’t I just enjoy the game? 
---
Hearthstone is the sort of game people would play on mobile while pooping in the toilet... Why in the world would I be interested in “pros” getting all tryhard on it? 
---
I do look at it now and then but maybe it is just me but it seems like they tend to frown on people my level that go there for advice or input. I lurk but don't post.
---
Thanks for the suggestion though.
---
What about do you still get a chunk of dust for the cars that rotate. I remember back when the first sets rotated you got a chunk of dust depending on how many cards you had that went wild is this still the case?
---
It’s very good... 2 damage on anything is still quite good
---
Frostmourne
---
It was never the case.

Of all the flavors you could choose, you decided to be salty.
---
Honestly making a comment without looking at the history bar is more stupid than not knowing an interaction, because the information was right there for you to pluck. Good job man
---
Used to play it on my Asus Transformer tablet. I popped it out about a year ago and found out that since they had updated something with it (or something in relation to the engine), it was no longer compatible. 
---
Try crafting 2 mind control techs
---
Oh, how surprising, someone who's been playing for 3 years doesn't have issue collecting cards.
---
I would have honestly gone millhouse, most of the time he's really good on 2.
---
Spice Decks (35 Legendary decks) are excellent fun, but very expensive. I recommend Yogg for the most fun value, maybe Reno Yogg Mage.
---
I would have picked Millhouse. It's a highroll most of the time on 2, and it's a dead card late. No worse then some other 2 drops.
---
The only amount of dust you get for cards just relegated to Wild is the same amount you get from disenchanting cards normally, and that only happens when you disenchant them.
---
Standalone#1521 NA 80g quest, you go first
---
Oh, how surprising, someone who's been playing for 3 years has a lot of cards.
---
I'm in fact more surprised you only have about 5 decks in each format, maybe you're not that good at managing dust as you claim to be. ^_^
---
That's control lock
---
How old is this? 1 mana rockbiter.
---
Never happened, sadly.
---
I tried buffing Jaraxxus in my hand with soul infusion, arena fanatic and spirit if the bat. Got it to 21 hp but when I played him he only had 15 hp. It would've been a great interaction but unfortunately Jaraxxus doesn't work that way.

The class as a whole is gonna be history. As a warlock main, im hoping for the best, but preparing for ungoro 2.0.
---
I thought renouncing Islam could get you killed in Saudi Arabia 
---
No way I already dusted all my wild cards. I will riot
---
I... don't think that's the most op thing that could come out of that
---
That's the thing though, I'm a warlock so usually I'd be the one with card advantage later on lol. 
---
And yeah, prince could be a boring old 3 Mana 3/3 but I wanna spice it up and try to go for crazy undatakah value. 
---
Thanks for the input man.
---
You learn this pretty quick playing with Lyra, from cards like Shadow Visions, Seance, and Thoughtsteal.
---
I appreciate the input. Imma go with undatakah.
---
I haven’t run in to that.  I haven’t won with either of those. I’ve won with 11 so far:
---
Priest heal/anti heal
---
Priest spell maker
---
Priest Deathrattle
---
Mage 0 mana hero power
---
Warlock discard
---
Warrior Shield power
---
Hunter Secrets
---
Shaman Battlecry
---
Shaman Spell -2
---
Rogue Steal
---
Paladin blessing shrine
---
He could have just ended his turn.
---
Yes, that's correct. It's only Whizbang in the deck selection screen and in the collection.
---
It's 2 people and they were both heavily downvoted. You're exaggerating 
---
What exactly do you mean by "Spell Power Mage?" 
---
Big Spell Mage? Between Blizzards and Flamestrikes and Dragon's Furies, you should be able to do decently against Hunters and win against most varients about half the time.
---
Tempo Mage playing with the Boomsday Spell Damage package? Well, without Mana Wrym, that deck isn't very good to begin with.
---
Or did you mean something else?
---
ALL MINIONS
---
I don't know why involve religious matters in a game subreddit. It's irrelevant and also inappropriate to call other people's religion "darkness".
---
Your entire collection goes into one deck and you win the next Hearthstone Championship automaticlly
---
How?
---
yeah i will in a sec
---
Everything for the memes!
---
What if you played Thekal after becoming Jaraxxus? Then you could get 14 armor, and heal back up to 15 as well. 
---
It's a bug. If you immediatly click a rush minion right after you summon it it can't attack...
---
Also, did you forget to switch accounts, buddy?
---
Because you can't just use your right hand to check descriptions?  FFS.  It must be a hard HARD life for some of you nitpickers.
---
Hey SkyeWint, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "Petition". Calling a thread a petition is essentially a subtle request for agreement upvotes, and petition threads generally tend to be poor prompts for constructive discussion.

Honestly this game is going down hill. This is the 5th or 6th post I’ve seen of some weird glitch in the past few days. I’d sell my account if I thought the hundreds of dollars I’ve invested in this and OW were worth anything. 
---
Honestly, I'd be more of an advocate for just turning jarraxus into a new hero card. Now its a staple mechanic it should be in the classic set IMO.
---
People on this sub hate aggro. 
---
It's my thoughts, you can see the same bullshit-ery in both game modes.   Though, I have moved from standard to WILD in the last month when from alpha/beta I hated WILD.    
---
Boy has my attitude changed since going WILD.   
---
But I do like invoker0169's irony in his statements though.  
---
26 damage in two turns even though you’re going to be barely ahead on board? Those’re some serious shenanigans with only a normal spell stone 
---
Then what was the point of your comment?
---
RIP OP
---
I can confirm. As a new player who posts to thread occasionally, it's crazy how many people want to down vote or make snarky remarks to people who haven't played for two years or more. 
---
It would be too much for *odd* Wild too.
---
But which one?!
---
Maybe it was turn 8 but tag not ready.. you get the idea.. and yes hunter can snowball
---
He probably means why would you show us the decklist like this. There are tons of better ways. 
---
Wait, so what did we decide on?
---

---
Yeah I heard about a year back priest got the wand of disintegration from dungeon run but 7 mana.
---
The Chinese client does. It looks neat. I'll see if I can find it. 
---
It's seen play here and there and there's always the possibility it'll see play again in the future, but it's usually part of more expensive decks. And since yours is gold, I would definitely consider disenchanting it if you're in need of dust for something useful.
