So am I to take it no random class legendary this time? Just this dude and the Galakronds? Not complaining, 6 free legendaries is pretty neat.

I didn’t know a woman won an esports event that’s freaking awesome!

This is such a broad topic, though I mean, what do you want the reality to be? **For there to be completely zero toxicity towards women in gaming? ** You know you can't have that for the simplest of reason that every single human being has their own opinion, can and will voice it, so **there’s always going to be people for and against something.**
---

---
It you are for toxicity towards women, then you are a huge pack of decayed rot. And no one wants that around.
---
Ah damn that's far. At least we got a bunch already.
---
A Cirlejerk inside a Cirlejerk god damn this is crazy
---
Yep, I'm aware, but I'm trying not to attack people for their opinions anymore regardless of what those opinions are. Bigots and transphobic people exist because they don't know any better and shaming them for the way they think tends to only perpetuate those thoughts.

Good way of putting it. Used to have a lot of faith in Iskar too. Now I think he's barricaded himself in so deep and hiding behind win/loss stats that he is refusing to hear anything else. The shit just isn't fun to play against when there is no counterplay if they have two specific cards in hand.
---
He outright betrays Tekhan by saying "I got what I needed from Uldum, I'm leaving, fuck all y'all," not that he looted the whole place dry and wants more, he clearly had an objective that he completed there. Presumably, the same can be said for Dalaran. Blackrock Mountain was for the fun of it, or something.

Reddit: ask a question, start a war
---
Ok, boomer
---
Lol. Out of all the different ways people mishear this card, this is exactly what I hear too.
---
It’s The Rock. /s
---
Suddently China not so bad eh?
---
It's a slow card and should add some fun to Quest Druid.  It's not bad in Quest Shaman if it were 8 Mana and they could double the battlecry.
---

---
Whooosh
---
Do you not realize that Invoke also triggers Galakrond's Hero Power? Almost all the Invoke cards are above rate already taking that into effect.
---
If you only knew the half of it.....
---
Note that Invoke also triggers Galakronds battlecry, even if he’s still in your deck. 
---
* I agree with the change to devoted Maniac.
---
* With Seal fate it becomes a deal 2 damage, add a lackey to your hand which is too strong imo. Maybe keep the original idea of 3 to an undamaged character but make it 2 cost.
---
* Dragonsblight Cultist is fine as is imo. With the Hero Power, it becomes at least a 3/1 which summons 2 1/1s. Making it a 3/2+2 1/1s would be too strong.
---

Inspire mecanic???
---
Yes they do. I am a trans woman and we certainly do this whole notion that trans women don't is stupid.
---
The point is she’s a woman whether you like it or not. Being a woman is how she chooses to express herself, so therefore she is a woman. It’s not about how you were born, because gender is exclusively a social construct. Someone can be biologically male and still be a woman.
---
GJ MATE! you just fixed these awfully weak cards even before they being implemented, please ask Blizzard for a job. ...
---
2 weeks ago: "fuck blizzard. I'm never buying anything from them again"
---
Now: "diablo 4 POG"
---
I just want to clarify; not only does invoke power up galakrond, it also triggers his hero power, even if he's in your deck. So for example, invoke cards used in warlock, in addition to their effect and powering up galakrond, they also spawn 2 1/1 imps from his hero power. When you look at it that way, the 3 Mana 1/1 at worst is a 3 Mana 3/1 that summons 2 1/1 imps, and the 4/5 taunt comes along with 2 1/1s etc. In rogue, the 3 Mana deal 3 also triggers his hero power which generates a lackey, so it's a 3 Mana deal 3 and add a lackey to your hand, or 1 Mana give a minion +1 attack add a lackey to your hand, neither of which are that bad. And in rogue there's more value in a 3 Mana deal 3 than a 2 Mana deal 2 because the 3 Mana one curves nicely with the hero power to deal 4 on 3 rather than deal 2 on 2.
---
&gt;This is not even remotely a reflection of reality
---
How? Try using your words rather than your feeling of smugness.
---
Look up organizational vs activational hormones/developmental periods. So many people (and legislative bodies) ignore this super critical piece of info when it comes to trans athletes.
---
No, these are horrendous ideas.
---
Dragonblight Cultist becomes a 3/2 *or with more Attack* that summons 2 1/1s. Invoke aside, that's too good.
---
Praise Galakrond! you just nerfed. Doubling the Mana for doubling the Attack granted? Yikes, that's awful.
---
Seal Fate is mostly better, seems unnecessary though.
---
Devoted Maniac looks like it would be weak, but it's also a Neutral Card and if anything *should* be weaker than the others of the lot.
---
In any case, you're changing cards that we haven't even seen in action yet. Hold your horses.
---
No your bone density, grip strength, muscle density, hand eye coordination, eye tracking, etc. Does not diminish with hrt. I have been on hrt for 8 years I am a trans woman this is stupid trans women should not be competing against cis women I'm sorry this is idiotic
---
And you offended the whole rectangle community and the circles that can’t tell the difference between squares and rectangle lol
---
Although I get the sentiment, its worth keeping in mind that people saying the former are often not the same people that now say the latter.
---
so if Chinese gamers don't say anything, you write a news article on them, and if they say something, you still write a news article on them
---
If you cast a Spell like **Never Surrender** (*when your opponent casts a spell give your minions +2 health*) will it trigger even if you don't have any minions on the board?  Is something consider a minion only when it's on the board but its something else when it's in your hand or your deck?
---
Hell yeah
---
I just wanted to have fun to see if I could balance it out better it's just opinionated
---
&gt; Only a person who doesnt need to see themselves in the world will say "I dont see race or gender", because to them it doesn't matter.
---
Exactly. Having such a huge ego and so much pride that you make those things matter just to feel important is pathetic.
---
Blizzcon competitive tourney is over. It's definitaly time to get rid of Evolve/Mutate. There is no way to play any other hero class.
---
(even I still believe Team-5 should take away "Evolve Lackey" , "Random Spell Lackey" like bad design Lackey. It's way too random stressful card!)
---
PogChamp
---
lol
---
So I can roughly explain it, and yeah it is confusing as fuck.  They have always had the grand final tournament around this time each year in the past, so in that sense this one is the same.  The difference is now how people qualify for it.  Before, the top point earners (gained from ladder finishes and the smaller tournaments) of each region would go to a regional final, and the top 2 from there of each region would go to the Blizzcon finals.  Now, it's different, in which the ways of qualifying is through "Grandmasters".  People qualified for Grandmasters simply by being chosen by Blizzard, for no exact reason, other than their overall performance throughout the years.  Some guys were into Grandmasters for being constantly high ladder finishers, some for having high success in tournaments, some for being high viewed streamers that also have some good wins/standings.    
---
You can see the final prize money, and who participated from each region here. There has been 2 'Grandmaster Seasons' that just finished, and the 2 winners from each regions Grandmaster went to this Blizzcon final.  Grandmaster is just sort of a round robin sort of long weekly tournament that spans over many weeks.

Did you even read any of the comments you responded to? This specific entire thread has ALWAYS been about Scarlett and females in eSports. You're the one trying to bring in irrelevant, political nonsense to this discussion. People deflect because your argument DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE in regards to Scarlett and eSports. It looks like you're using this as a platform to promote your own beliefs. If you want to talk about physical sports go to r/sports but if you're going to bring that shit to a discussion about eSports in an eSports subreddit then no shit you're going to get bashed because it makes no sense. One would think, logically, that the tirade of downvotes and the removal of your comments by a moderator would be your first clue that your argument isn't relevant to the discussion.
---
Because HS is dead and Blizzard doesn't actually care that much about it anymore. Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV are in the works.
---
&gt;How is this subreddit still active did everyone forget about what blizzard stands for already
---
No one actually cares.
---
I do actually make a donation every month. Spamming threads gets the message out there. I could give a fuck less if you wanna hear it. People are being tortured, beaten and murdered for wanting freedom. All this says is you all would rather bury your head in the sand. That's fine, and ima keep doing me and making sure every time you wanna ignore the atrocities taking place so you can sit back peacefully and enjoy your video game that people are fucking dying, and you're supporting the company that supports that regime. Get mad, get angry, and put that anger where it belongs, towards china and the people that support them.
---
Oh wait I forgot, it doesnt effect you so what the hell right, just gonna keep pouring money into a company that looks at that shit and goes "this is fine so long as I get paid". You should be ashamed of yourself. Then again your freedom isnt under attack. Your family isnt being threatened, you arent being tortured so why give a fuck.
---
People are talking about women in eSports. Scarlett isn't a woman. That's literally the topic you clown.
---
To play the devil's advocate: Who is to say that some people don't use the word woman/man/male/female as a biological distinction and not a gender one? That is what it used to be historically.
---
If the gender stereotypes are too narrow for people to match their biological sex, wouldn't it make more sense for SOCIETY to widen the gender roles (or obliterate the borders completely), because they are after all SOCIALLY constructed? Maybe that way women can be more assertive without being called a bitch too, and men can be openly emotional without being called a sissy. But we avoid having someone with 10+ years advantage in muscle gain, denser bone structure and huge hands go on hormone blockers for 15 months and then be allowed to fight a biological woman in combat sports... 
---
This topic is obviously a minefield but from my observation the solutions do not match the problems.

Do you have a link for this?
---
Firebat has asked about it at blizzcon and they said they knew about it beforehand.
---
You’re switching the context. In your original comment, you were talking about how your chromosomes determine both your gender and your sex, now you’re changing that.
---
I’m saying that your sex is determined by your chromosomes, however, you get to choose your gender. There’s a difference, and you’re mixing the two together.
---
Yes. All Hearthstone players who oppose genocide run for President of China.
---
I am not being persecuted you are correct.  This is about your direct behavior towards me.  Which is bigoted.  The act of being bigoted is an individual affair, persecution comes from the masses.
---
And I can't be persecuted, because I don't care what the masses think.
---
Then take Harth Stonebrew's advice from the first trailer and just do what's most fun. Enjoy it!
---
I restarted fresh cause I was dusting cards to put together a deck, was barely into the game so prob the best choice. Bought the welcome bundle and my legendaries are The Beast &amp; Deathwing plus all the freebies they gave out for now. Any advice is highly appreciated!
---
It was a card that was regularly included in odd decks
---
Note: Hagatha didn't do its 3 damage, and as you can see by the hero art, did not indicate health or armor
---
&gt;Haha I'm sure you won't!
---
100% because you lied about your degree :)
---
You're a coward, and all those who ignore the evils of China and throw their money at the oppressive regime are traitors to humanity.
---
Packs available to open or bonuses available in game?
---
You also seem to not understand what gender study is, but it is only tangentially related to the science behind transgenderism. I'd recommend checking out some study summaries on nih or even something more readable at sciencedaily to get your feet wet.

---
As soon as they get turn 4 Hare, Mogu, Evolved they're going to fire you. Sorry OP.

for real though, good luck!
---
Replaces the same championship with a slightly less prestigious one.
---
Was just a joke since she was covering her nose in the pic. So much paranoia on here since a girl won.
---
You need to have pre-ordered the expansion (any bundle) or have bought a Blizzcon ticket
---
World Championship was more prestigious. More prize money. A much more gruelling process to get there. Bo16 instead of Bo8, etc.

Why are you getting down voted
---
WHO CARES........AMAZING
---
You know you can do dailies in other game modes? But I understand what you mean.
---
Nah bro, I totally agree with you but some people are just suckers.
---
No
---
Golden cards represent upgraded cards, so I'll assume no on the first one
---
Ahh ok. Didn’t know. I wonder if they did it on purpose then
---
Observation not statistic
---
you do realize more scientists and studies support the idea that there is either an advantage or not enough information. the few studies that are flaunted about that show no advantage use ridiculous measures for how they determine that like testosterone levels and nothing else. yess some trans women have less testosterone than some cis women but that doesnt mean they have no advantage from other things like grip strength bone density etc
---
LOL right? I think Chinese reddit bots tbh all these pro ccp accounts are 1 month old that commented
---
barely not to the extent of being equal to a trans woman and in some studies it has been shown that estrogen can actually conserve bone density
---
&gt;I feel the **devs need to better anticipate the most powerful, oppressive decks** so that they don't get out of hand. 
---
One of the many things Mark Rosewater said in his GDC talk is that card game designers need to give their players room to explore. Occasionally, it will result in a broken mess (like what most likely happened in MSoG format with Patches the Pirate), but it also results in pleasant and often welcomed surprised like Heal Zoo.
---
A fully solved format created in the design and balance stages is going to be a dull, boring format. Even if it is balanced, there's not really going to be any excitement with it.
---
Additionally, it is better to take a risk and fail than never to have never taken the risk at all when it comes to card deisng. 
---
Trying something exciting, something that'll engage the playerbase meaningfully, even if breaks Standard asunder is so much better than being afraid of breaking anything. Players will forgive train wrecks. They will not forgive being bored.
---
Despite Frozen Throne and K&amp;C formats being broken messes, they were high point's in the games history because every deck could do exciting things.
---
Conservative design is boring design. The Year of the Raven showed us that. Minions that are just stats don't engage anyone anymore, and printing new ones more than on occasion is not going to increase the game's longevity.
---
You're also never going to get rid net decking. Some people do not enjoy playing Hearthstone's meta-game, and they are not lesser players for it either.
---
China doesn't have a Grandmasters system. Its hilarious that Lion is the Grandmasters Global Finals champion without being a Grandmaster. 
---
The reason she won also has something to do with her not being one. The CN scene is way more competitive and grindy with Open Tournaments and a pure merit based selection. She had to work really hard to get there. Grandmasters on the other hand had Pathra  in it.
---
where are you reading that? i literally quoted from it saying that all previous studies done were based on hormone levels and were inadequate and that the study done on performance showed that when males transitioned there was no loss in performance. it also states that hemoglobin levels and "the number of nuclei within individual muscle cells (called myonuclei) dictate the training response of skeletal muscle in addition to the hormonal milieu (3,5). The important question here is whether the MTF transition and/or HRT with associated muscle atrophy have an impact on the number of myonuclei. If not, some of the biological advantage of a male biology will remain, irrespective of “normalizing” the levels of circulating hormones." They don't make assumptions and state either way yes or no trans women should be included they give reasons for why it may or may not be true and how other studies are lacking in many ways
---
Get out of here with this racist shit.

It’s basically in maintenance mode, and most of the heroes are just back logged from when the game wasn’t dead.

You're saying if one specific card, stops 5 others from being printed, then those 5 are the ones with the problem?
---
Yeah, I find the mulligan to be really important. If I fail to get a decent start, it's game over a lot of the time for sure.
---
Yeah. It's however not fun tho when lots of matches end like this. That you lose instantly because your opponent got the combo before you could kill him and you lose.
---
It also dumbs down matchups to "Does he draw the combo or not" and "Do I have my silence or am I straight up fucked" rather than many turns of decisions.
---
The need to push someone to give her opinion of political matter which she probably dont give a damn, is more align with the ccp propaganda tactics than the freedom you preach about.

idk, personally it doesn’t irritate me. if an asian hero is replaced by a white actor, as long as the movie stays true to the movie i don’t mind. i remember when ghost in her shell (forgive me if i got the name wrong) casted scarlett johansson, there was some outcry in america by those saying its asian erasure or something along those lines. however, the japanese themselves thought it was awesome, and had zero complaints about the casting since she did such a good job acting. i feel like i share their sentiments in such cases.

---
Also, next time you should consider your word choice if you want to be taken seriously. 
---
"You're a coward" is a bold statement from someone on an online forum board. 
---
"Evils of China" sounds awfully vague. It's the type of bland statement that someone makes when they have an opinion simply because it's popular, and not because they did their own research. 
---
"Throw their money at the oppressive regime" Today I learned that Blizzard is an oppressive regime. Either that, or you think that buying something from Blizzard is equivalent to funding the PRC.
---
"Traitors to humanity" is a meaningless derogatory term that could literally be applied to anyone with any opinion that I disagree with. The world isn't black and white. You think it's ridiculous that anyone would support an oppressive regime, while others think it's ridiculous that anyone would support violent mobs assaulting innocent civilians.
---
Different perspectives result in people forming different opinions. You clearly have yet to see this from a different perspective, and your hostility towards people who don't endulge in your circlejerk is a contributing factor.
---
Even in Wild that shit is bananas. Rogues would bounce that shit or scheme it and, if your deck is not catered to counter it, you'll be blown away by how much bs that deck could achieve.

The best thing about this is that it still would be! You’d be able to enter a match and play for free just like you will tomorrow, but the Gauntlet Mode would be another option if you want to try and grind resources like people do with Arena. And the Grand Tournament mode would come around once a month so that wouldn’t be the only option either!

It's not "taking pride". As a woman into gaming I never had other girls to talk to about it, in fact I was mostly shunned for being a weirdo. So it's nice to see that other/more girls are taking an interest in gaming since it is male dominated. The more girls play the more it becomes "normal". It's nice to see and gives a positive message to girls like me.
---
Your opponent probably took it literally that the voiceline that dr boom says is on purpose. "You. You're good" comes off very sarcastic when you play it before a win. Also some people think when you say GG before a win then it's BM either way if the loser doesn't GG first but whatever. \o/

Women get the most encouragement because they also get the most discouragement. If you weigh up encouragement vs discouragement, men get the most total encouragement per discouragement. Probably white cis males, though race doesn’t matter nearly as much as gender.

There are no refunds for those cards now. Only if you had them in you collection at the start of the Rise of Shadows expansion in april.
---
You can play your old decks in Wild, and I would not recommend disenchanting stuff. Just buy some packs from all the standard sets until you hit the first legendary. Then buy Uldum and RoS packs until the next expansion hits.
---
Craft some cheap decks like Murloc Shaman (you should have most of the cards from classic anyway) or Combo Priest for now.

Have fun!

Gender equality is definitely political. I’m not going to do a whataboutism, but saying gender equality is not political is actually kind of harmful by making it seem like there isn’t actually discourse on the issue, which makes it much easier to dog whistle about and push sexism. People do the same about fascism, saying it’s not political because “nobody’s really fascist, and nobody is legitimately pushing fascism in politics nowadays, right?”.
---
They have an expansion coming up. They are not going to bother putting out a balance patch before it comes. Right now they are going to start the hype phase, with a lot of dev involvement in the forums, responses about card design and all that shit, and they will just rotate Evolve out from Standard again when the xpac hits, and then go dark, as usual.

Mad respect. Good job. I hope this sends a message for any aspiring female gamer that they can succeed too.
---
Because it’s a sign if growing gender equality because women have largely been discouraged from playing, resulting in women performing worse in competitive play on sports where there is no meaningful physical or cognitive difference between men and women. Like, if there was actual gender equality, this would be a common occurrence in esports and not a big deal.

Hero cards vs highlander cards from SoU. Although the actual \*number\* of legendaries is a point of contention.

I’ve always felt the blizzard hearthstone tournaments have been so poorly communicated to its fan base, half the time I don’t know what I’m watching, who’s won what, where the bracket is, who’s playing next, what it means, where it’s going, who am I?!
---
The strength of a class isn't decided by how many legendaries they print for it.

Yes, thank you, exactly! Seeing girls winning tournaments really helps other girls engage in competitive e-sports!

Also, shame on the person below saying girls are only talking about her hair (like wtf?)

It happens soooo often in HS.

Player A plays a broken combo. "No way they can answer that!"
---
Player B plays a broken counter to the broken combo.

It's kind of ironic that you consider them to be shallow.

From rank 10 to 6 I actually had twice as many Rogues, but since hitting rank 5 it is nearly ALL Shaman.

December 10, 2019
---
I love brightwing. Crafted it just for my Highlander quest rogue and I will say it was an awesome card and fun to play
---
I disagree with many of these... I think you aren't putting enough value on health or leveling up.
---
From what I've seen so far, the best way to win the game is ramping to level 5, and then getting Brann or Lightfang and buffing your cards as much as possible.
---
What do you think about this:
---
**A.F. Kay**: You want to freeze a board with a token, so you can sell the token on your first active turn for a faster level up and an extra minion. This leaves you at the same level as everyone else (They leveled up the previous turn but can't level up the current turn) except you have a 1\*,3\*,4\* board (discovered too), compared to others 1\*,1\*,2\*. Tier 1.
---
**Millificent Manastorm**: Strong with an early amalgam, but weak mid game otherwise. There aren't many good mechs until Rover at level 4. Tier 2.
---
**Nefarian**: Agree that breaking divine shields is really good. Tier 1.
---
**Patchwerk**: Not much better off than anyone else, but he has more room for error with bad rolls. I'd say it's comparable to having a second life. Tier 2.
---
**Rag**: Seems bad to me. If everyone is playing the buff strat, then the 16 damage seems pretty negligible. I hardly ever see people with 2 gold to spare until very late, or if you're desperate. By then a couple random hits won't save you. Tier 3 at best.
---
**Patches**: I think this is the worst hero power. It doesn't let you ramp faster, and 1 gold is a bit much for such a lackluster effect. Lets you counter some demon builds by taking out the 3/3 before it gets any buffs. Tier 4.
---
**Shudderwok**: Unless you are going pogo, I see this hero power as redundant when you can use Brann or Lightfang, but I can also see it as a good addition while you're searching for them. If you can get past the weak mid game, it's pretty good. Tier 3.
---
**Curator**: Amalgam is really good. I would consider it worth around 3 gold very early in the game, plus it will win you the first 2-3 rounds with most 1\*. Helps you make a wide board too. I would put it in Tier 1 because of the consistency, but I could see someone make an argument that it's tier 2 if normal Amalgam is common enough.
---
**Lich King**: I think this hero power is best when paired with Maexxna, Ghastcoiler, Sneeds, or Egg. This makes him awesome late game, but not great early game. Tier 2.
---
**Gallywix**: Bad hero power turn 1 and 2, but okay in the mid game after that. Overall, pretty mediocre. Haven't seen enough games with him to make a final judgement, but my instincts say tier 3.
---
**Giantfin**: I think you overestimate the value of 1/1 tokens with no taunt that can't be buffed as they spawn. Plus, murlocs seem pretty bad so far because you basically need level 6 before you can start ramping up the late game. Tier 4.
---
**Professor Putricide**: Basically requires Hydra or Foe Reaper, otherwise useless hero power. Tier 4.
---
**Jaraxxus**: Level up to 2 on turn 2, and then wait until you have a full board of demons. Then, rush level 5 while using your power every turn. Can't take good advantage of poisonous. Tier 4.
---
**Bartendotron**: Rush level 5 ASAP. You can get to it without stopping. Then, fill your board while you wait for Brann or Lightfang. Tier 3.
---
**George**: Divine shield is ridiculous; you will basically always win the late game unless you are against Nefarian. Tier 2.
---
**Infinite Toki**: I think you really underestimate how useful a consistent high tier minion choice is. A guaranteed 6 cost every turn for 1 gold late game, as well as great mid game? Tier 1.
---
**King Mukla**: Would be so much better if there was a beast with a battlecry buff before tier 6. I think there's potential. Tier 3.
---
**The Great Akazamzarak**: Haven't seen this guy yet. I imagine 2 gold for a 1-time-use secret is horrible. Sounds worse than Patches hero power, but I have no idea how he works. Tier 4?
---
**Rat King**: Amazing early and mid game. Useless hero power in the late game, but you can ramp to level 5 very fast without fear. Tier 1.
---
**Dancin' Deryl**: If you can fill your board early on with tokens, and then have a huge +14+14 midgame push, I think it could work out pretty well, but risky. Tier 4 with high-roll potential.
---
**Lich Baz'hial**: Same as Bartendotron, but with Mal'Ganis potential. Tier 3.
---
**Pyramid**: I think you are underestimating health value. Great mid game. Tier 2.
---
**Wagtoggle**: 1 gold for decent value. Strong mid game. Tier 2.
---
**Yogg-Saron**: Save 1 gold for each minion, AND give it a buff. Almost useless hero power lategame, but insane midgame. I think you way underestimated here. Tier 1.
---
How did you lose twice??
---
Wouldn't someONE have to teach him to use that powerful magic to deceive the other entities too then? ..in Draconic?
---
nice because im looking for "fun" in this game
---
ill give brightwing a try
---
\[\[Dreadscale\]\] saw some play. It was an ok card.

3/4/2 Beast | At the end of your turn, deal 1 damage to all other minions.  
---
The current meta is trashed 😂 I usually rank 5 but I'm currently at 12 could care less.
---
In casual Highlander rogue is nuts. Possibility to use zephrys 3+ times as well as using it for zero Mana every time after the initial use. Plus all the random legendaries you get from faceless collector, 5 3/5 Rush, and brightwing. Definitely high skill gap but I've even beated N'Zoth priest with it. 3 zephrys is OP sometimes
---
This is kind of silly.
---
He already knows how to deceive. He’s most likely a blue dragon.
---
Also, YOU are learning draconic from the scroll Reno is translating.
---
Unless it is gonna mandatory. No. Maybe not even then.

Have you seen how girls operate in real life like outside the internet lol

I wish Patches' hero power had something to do with Charge, honestly. Not that this one is bad, it'd just be a nice callback.

It was already the case, though. Seance, Togwaggle's Scheme, Youthful Brewmaster, Baleful Banker. This isn't going to chage that dynamic. 
---
Besides, I don't think that N'zoth decks will be the first choice for this card. Too greedy.  More likely some immediate Combos, like with Shirvallah or other discounted minions.

Interesting, I'm not up on WOW lore. We did find out Shaman is getting two legendaries besides the hero card. Could be both. I will check reveal chart for hints of him, I did see some lightning dragons in the reveal chart so I think we will get some classic style lightning dragons.
---
I assume Sindragosa cause of the trailer but Onyxia could be good too.
---
should be in 8 hours from now!
---
Pick tomb diver treasure, secrets deck, and the secret related card buckets.
---
That's because the patch hasn't rolled out yet. They couldn't show your packs in game because they weren't inside game files. And they weren't inside game files so people couldn't datamine them before BlizzCon. 
---
Patch rolls out today and it will add all the stuff. Packs, in game pre orders, Deathwing portrait, Satharovvar, and of course HS Battlegrounds.
---
Complains from pros and casuals are not a problem tho. For Blizzard, a problem would be a decline of players due to this meta, which apparently not a case.
---
So it would be just stupid for him to change anything in this case.

It's actually the other way around....if Galakrond isn't a powerhouse....then the EVIL classes will have useless INVOKE cards thus putting them at a disadvantage.
---
Hasnt Hafu won the Blizzcon WoW arena tournament in the past?
---
Kharkut defender is a new healbot.
---
2. If you don't have interest playing wild, yes you should dust rotated cards.
---
3. Good idea, however decks you mentioned aren't standard anymore. you would either have to play wild or build some cheap deck which shouldn't be hard as you have lots of classic cards
---
What changes are you gonna make? Mana costs, hero power costs, the hero powers themselves? Any nerfs?
---
Way to diminish someone's accomplishments... Yes, there is a significant RNG factor in HS and almost every game, but there is an immense thought process that goes behind to reduce your chances of being screwed by RNG and she did it in a great manner.
---
I’m as cool as the other side of the pillow.  :)
---
But why? Sure, if 50% of overall players were women then it would make sense. But given that significantly more men play Hearthstone (and games on general), it's statistically improbable. And right now I don't see a reason for this trend to change that drastically over just a few years.
---
Maybe eventually we'll have an even spread, or maybe in the future we'll have more women playing games than man, because men will find themselves another hobby? Who knows? But it's not going to happen in just 5 years.
---
Isn't this just attack face, play defile, win?
---
Don’t forget Tempo Rogue
---
Did, did she say anything about HK?
---
Those are two different things.  
---
Not having a representative in something because it doesn't fit the situation is one thing and her winning HS as a female, which is a very small minority in esports overall, is another.
---
They can't show up until they patch the game, and that will happen in 7.5 hours.
---
&gt;all control style decks are noticeably weak due to the fact that Control simply just doesn't work in wild.  
---
Jade Druid has been consistently tier two for months or years now. Odd Warrior was also very present in the format for a while too.
---
Even then, similar things do seem to happen in other games' eternal formats.
---
Hearthstone also really isn't a game well suited to one hundred card singleton decks. One hundred cards right now is still a full five percent of Hearthstone's total card total, and not even commander decks in Magic are really one hundred cards since about forty of them are going to be lands. 
---
One hundred health is also way too much to start with, especially if it's only 1v1. Much of what makes Paper and even MTGO Commander fun is the table politics and even just being around three or more other people to talk to while you play for two hours.
---
Ok but can you ban Oko?

I can make a definitive statement of about 2% of people out of 1000 'free hong kong'ers donated to the hong kong cause, or did anything meaningful other than virtual signing and spreading hateful racist comments online.

Alright fuck you dude
---
Because then rafaam would only achieve drawing cards at no health cost.
---
Okay, I should have made myself more clear, but I thought it was obvious that I'm not talking about playing casually on phone when discussing tournaments. A person playing Bejeweled on their phone has no impact on tournament representation in competitive games whatsoever. When you look at the stats you need to go deeper than just a quick google search that will tell you that 46% of gamers are women.
---
Here are some stats. They're from 2017 but I don't think that much has changed since then: https://www.statista.com/statistics/694381/gamer-share-world-genre-and-gender/
---
As you can see, there are in fact much more women playing "Match 3" genre, for example, which is definitely one of the most popular genres in the entire world. But now look at genres like strategy, MOBA or first person shooter - the competitive / e-sport titles - and you can see that women are still minority (~10% or less).
---
Gaming patterns also vary between men and women. Here are some stats on that: https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/women-account-for-46-of-all-game-enthusiasts-watching-game-video-content-and-esports-has-changed-how-women-and-men-alike-engage-with-games/ 
---
According to the study, 36% of women declare themselves as "time filler" gamers (playing only when they have time to spare, mostly mobile), compared to 19% men. On the other hand, 15% men describe themselves as "ultimate gamers" (so hardcore gamer), compared to 9% in women. There are more categories, but to make the long story short, men are leaning towards "hardcore", while women are leaning towards "casual/mobile". So sure, nearly 50% of gamers are women, but context matters. 
---
I don't believe that there is any significant difference in skill between men and women playing the same games for the same amount of time. So why don't we see more women in the big tournaments? One of the main factors (the most important factor IMO) is - like I've said in my previous comment - because they're still in minority when it comes to playerbase of those popular e-sport titles. That, and the fact that they in general prefer to play casually than competitively. I don't think that this conclusion is "bs made out of nothing", but feel free to prove me wrong.
---
My bad. Since September I only log in for daily quest. 
---
My point was that is not very hard to remember secrets and to know how to test at least two secrets with one action
---
Yeah I just want a game where if you play and you're good enough you can reach the top.  Whether that:s 50/50 or 90% men or 90% women that's cool.  I'm just hoping that now we have a female champion we can get rid of this whole "women need help or special treatment to reach the top" nonsense.  They don't, Lion just proved it, let's get rid of the women-only tournament and the slots reserved for women in invitationals and just have a meritocracy please!

How many games u see people lost for a single Edwin 10-12 turn 2?

If people felt like you then this wouldn't be a successful karma farming technique. Karma is given because, on some level, people on average appreciate the post.

---
In other words, your needs are not our needs and your vision for Reddit is not shared by us.
---
Warrior will get a Galakrond card, as well.
---
I fail to see how is that relevant to stats.
---
If anything you'd consider not shadowstepping at all if it had decent stats to contest the board
---
Oh you missed it then. Evil classes still get the standard 2 legendaries on top of the hero cards. So they get 3 legendaries in total.
---
Works fine on my Galaxy S8, probably specific to some android models.
---
What are "basic" cards? The ones with grey borders? Are they completely useless once you get cards with golden borders and "gargoyle" borders?
---
Meanwhile, does it look like we Europeans give a damn about this? Well, maybe some on the fringe would do. But it's definitely NOT universal the same way it would be over there in USA.
---
The answer is no. You will never know if one day you suddenly feel like playing wild, and when you do, you really wished you hadn’t DE-ed your old legendaries. 
---
However, I don’t mind looking at your list and telling you which ones are safe to DE :)
---
Np, I thought the same thing also at first glance
---
I was trying to make a joke and missed it really bad...
---
Why does this matter? If someone's weird hobby if collecting internet points leads to me finding out stuff that others consider old news, then I have no issue with that.

Look up the decklists for Highlander Hunter and Paladin. In both cases, 99% of players will be using the recommended set of secrets, and they only play one of each. So it isn't that hard to learn what they are and play round them. It's a little harder sometimes with Mage, or if the Hunter/Paladin plays something that gives a random secret, but even then you you can test for it. It also helps if you use a deck tracker that shows what it could be and what you've already tested for.

The ones without a crystal that you get from completing the tutorial and getting classes to lvl 20. The textless ones are useless, but a lot of the class cards are very strong. But if you're comparing \[\[Silverback Patriarch\]\] to expansion cards, you could find the latter to be strong.

concede, if you think it's annoying then you are playing a deck that can never beat it. Only keep playing if you're playing some otk combo or have a wincondition that doesn't care about the board. Saves both of you time and makes the shuffling irrelevant.

Even then, a 2/8 is still nothing to really scoff at for a five mana minion with a battlecry as strong as the new Malygos'.
---
shudderwock doesn't stick. And if it does, you should probably just kill the opponent instead of shuffling extra copies of shudder.
---
It's like the other comment said. Tuskar got nerfed for that.
---
I'd rather try summoning a totem with all powers combined. a 1/3 taunt, healing, +1 spell damage.
---
quest druid is really fun. The shell is super strong and allows for druid to do meme combos. Just Elise + floop + baleful open up the potential for so many jank combos. Especially with jepetto and thaurissan. If you think quest druid can't be fun, you're not thinking outside the box
---
A quest deck may have at least two-thirds dedicated to either completing the deck or taking advantage of the reward.
---
A Galakrond deck will only need Galakrond, the other Invoke pay-offs, and between four and six Invoking effects depending on the quality of the cards in question.
---
Gee, thanks for the insight Mr. Literal.
---
Don't dust legendaries until you're done opening packs from an expansion. You really don't want to open a legendary that you don't want multiple times
---
Since I didn't see any Battlegrounds subreddits, thought I'd create one to foster some discussion until a bigger or more official one pops up. If you could repost this post on r/BobsTavern i think it would be perfect for over there.
---
I just don’t understand why you can’t just say “Hey, what a coincidence. Take my upvote.” But instead you have to complain about “it not being relevant.” It’s still relevant. Hong Kong is still protesting and fighting for their freedom.
---
if your such a freedom fighter why not join your country’s armed forces, or if not do something to actually hello fight back this totalitarian government instead of saying they’re bad (I mean they are, but you aren’t healing with anything)
---
PUTCHO FEIF IN THE LIGHT *chorus*

Tyrion has been one of my favorite cards since the beginning
---
Just play [Charged Hammer]
---
He...hey. You want to buy a *funnel cake*?
---
**BUY ONE**
---
Yes.  "Awareness" increases pressure which makes requiring a response and action more likely.  It's really simple and objectively obvious.
---
If out of any given number of people, X% will be compelled to protest a specific issue, then by increasing the number people aware of a specific issue, you increase the overall number of people protesting.  Also, there is general human psychology truth, in that the more people that find a certain thing acceptable, the more likely others will adopt it too, so not only are you increasing the overall potential pool of protesters, you are also increasing the overall efficacy of X.
---
So again, yes, he is either lying or dumb.
---
BY FIRE BE PURGED!
---
You want to feel regret? Dust a legendary. That's what regret feels like.
---
Yes and im all for that, but that has nothing to do with blizzard, but people still wanna think it does.
---
Well, I still considered that an option, hence why I was wondering if there's an official statement on that.
---
I heard this tournament had 128 players, and 127 of them got banned for supporting Hong Kong, is true?
---
Same, I play it every day on my phone.
---
I'm on Android, maybe it's an iPhone thing?

So much virtue signaling by armchair activists.

You got the best deal anywhere!

Hi boys
---
This sounds awesome!
---
It's sad to see you getting downvoted, because that's exactly the biggest problem with Hearthstone. Ranked ladder is the only mode that the majority of people play and since it's just "win at all costs" people just look up the best deck and play that. Since Hearthstone has no intention of ever making a game mode that allows homebrewing to thrive, and most of the playerbase seemingly has no intention of ever trying to build their own decks without the help of a website, I have moved on from this game. I know netdecking exists in all card games, but why does it seem so much worse in this one?
---
We in this

Praise Yogg, God of RNG!

Taking my chances!

Thank you very much!

I would like it!

My recommendation would be a budget token druid, murloc shaman, or midrange hunter. All would be viable for climbing up to at least rank 5 or so and the first two of those are rather flexible in terms of cards you could substitute in and the strongest cards in the deck are Rares. I wasn't trying to be a dick btw in my original post, it's just that for "complete" or optimal meta decks, you're looking at 6K+ dust minimum which would require buying a good deal of packs. I actually didnt' pre purchase this last expansion for the first time in quite a few expansions and even I have struggled to make many meta decks.
---
Edit: Token/Midrange hunter might be more of the tempo/midrange you're looking for, while Murloc shaman is a strong aggro deck
---
May Yogg grant me this win!

Will you notify us with e-mail? That made me happy. I really like her.

Hello world

Yeet

I never win these things

Crafting Whizzbang (4 cost legendary) is fun if you just want a bunch of decks to play around with. He gives you a random deck recipe out of the 18 blizzard gives. I crafted a golden one so I could flex on people. The decks aren’t all super good, but they can get some wins and showcase new cards
---
No way I actually get free stuff from blizzard
---
"Hope is an illusion"

Bundle pls

Good luck to all of you guys!

What's that lol
---
Shaman is fine. Evolve will be out of standard next month. No reason to change for now.
---
He got rightly downvoted for commenting a play without knowing the context of the game. He did have Flame Ward up, otherwise he wouldn't have done that.
---
Going on a tirade about the bias of the sub was just the cherry on top.
---
Hello hello hello!
---
Cheating is 100% terrible and should always result in being banned, but people DO get banned over playing the game how cards work.
---
The Snap/Mech combo for example, Autoban if you exceed the timer, if you hold your cards in your hand, it stops the counter, boom. You didn’t realize it stops the timer? YOU’RE BANNED, your opponent Modified files and broke the timer for both of you? You didn’t realize? BOOM you’re banned.
---
May the odds be in my favor

Yes please

Give packs pls

Yeaaaa boiiiiii

Silly zoomer using emojis on reddit.
---
1. They said about 9 months. And it's for thinking of the new theme only. They probably don't say that early: Let's make this set OP af
---
2. Even if they start developing a certain set then, there were many times when they changed cards shortly before release
---
Nice 1 in about a million chance easy

Lets go!

Eh, look who's here!

But you've been profiting from their products your whole life. Your clothes and electronics are made by modern slaves. And after you have used your plastics and electronics, you guys dump it back in China/india
---
Why don't you post a picture here smashing your iPhone or burning your Nikes?
---
When's your next protest for the immensely underpaid South American fruitfarmers you're profiting from? Or your coffee? Why aren't you fighting for their rights?
---
Where's your outrage for all the bombed kids by your government the past 7 decades? How many people have you mobilised? Petitions organised? When are you gonna protest for their democracy? 
---
You don't recognise the immense hypocrisy here?
---
When it comes down to your own comfort, you couldn't give a shit anyway.

Good luck to all

Dunno I had to click on the deck and they were there. Just a visual bug

oh boyy

Might as well try, gl everybody!

Let’s gooooo

Personal best guest: they care more about PC. Releases always have bugs and if they timed this right so that mobile and PC went out at the same time, they’d be caught fixing PC bigs and leaving Mobile in a broken state. 
---
Or more simply. This delay gives them time to address any major issues with PC and potentially prevent them in Mobile. 
---
But yes. I too am religiously updating the app store to see if the update is read :)

Yes, they are both dreadlord-type of demons. So what? What's so unusual about it? It would only be appropriate if they had similar effects.

Same issue here.

---
Wow so many comments.
---
China bad upvotes to the left
---
Rolling need!
---
Winning one of these might would definitely gove me motivation to get back into HS, battlegrounds looks awesome
---
And a properly built deck in an all singleton format is going to end up being at least one-third legendary cards, pricing out a large chunk of Hearthstone's audience.
---
Sure, old Standard favorites may not be able to find much success in Wild, but not every card can be good.
---
So guaranteed one 1 free pack and another if your team wins.
---
The more you accumulate point ranks the additional the prizing are.
---
Not really worth to play unless the additional prizing is more packs
---
Good luck everyone
---
Blizz pls

Good luck

Sometimes lucky?

Everything in that deck just gets pointed at the opponent’s face, so why do you even need card text?

(I say this as someone who likes Secret Mage and has a Golden Aluneth.)

You get a regular version for free. Would call it free.

We need to stop calling them 'Blizzard' the heart and soul of Blizzard died a long time ago.  This is Activision who's behaving like this and ruining the greatest games.
---
Free stuff seems good to me.
---
This set looks crazy, and I’m broke!
---
With the incomplete deck glitch, I think it just doesn’t understand golden cards for some reason? The only ones it told me to replace were the couple golden cards in each deck
---
Give pls
---
Well... Got nothing to lose by trying, right? Still pre-ordering though. Goodluck and may the luckiest person wins!
---
All of your cards are region locked, so changing your region will just mean you have no cards to play with.
---
So China agrees to the UK's bs terms about Hong Kong for 99 years when it rightfully belongs to them, and now that it's over they still can't have what is rightfully theirs?

Yes, exact same problem. There's a [Bug Report](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/hearthstone/t/no-new-daily-quest/17128) about this problem on the HS forums, if you want to add your report there.

Just played my first game and have run into the exact same issue. I lost after going straight back into combat four times in a row without even a chance to recruit. 
---
The new game mode is literally unplayable on mobile.
---
**what, don’t you guys have phones??**

There’s definitely gonna be some strategy that’s better than the others. But right now it’s all about  everyone experimenting and finding out which ones best haha there will definitely be a meta almost guaranteed

Free bundle is free, and I would not object to winning it
---
yes they are
---
This time is win time?
---
Hi :)
---
Let's win
---
Put pair of mogu's in the deck + evolve which is free for now , with the pressure from murlocs + bloodlust you will definately outvalue any reborn deck if played properly
---
Well it certainly never hurts to try.
---
Come to papa!
---
oh too bad :( im on amazon app store
---
the real reason they made battlegrounds
---
&gt;but you clearly omit how a significant portion of the population just want to live and work in peace without any disturbance
---
Part of that is because I was replying to the person who specifically said, *"This is absolutely not true and you have no evidence that suggests...",* so my response became slanted because I got goaded into it.
---
The other reason is related to what I have brought up in my other comment below. Majority of my coworkers are anti-China, and they openly meme about it quite regularly. So I sort of have to join that circlejerk, though I do indeed mostly agree with them. But as you said, they don't get the full picture on the HK situation. 
---
\&gt;  they all do agree that HK's gone to shit with all the rioting and stuff and just want the status quo back. 
---
Yes, that's understandable and very valid opinion.
---
Sylvanas is a believable character.

I like free stuff

At least I will have chicken.

Let's test my luck

You don't have to use any ticket. All players get non golden version if they log on.
---
Might as well, although knowing Blizzard I can't really expect anything to happen.
---
Plz bro plz!
---
!
---
Finally I can use Voone
---
But what makes them the *most* qualified, is what I'm getting at. Your position seems to be "white people got the roles, ergo white people were the better actors". 
---
There is a disproportionate lack of black (and other minority) actors in the US. For example, far less than 15% of union actors are black.  
---
What's holding them back? Is it lack of skill, lack of opportunity, lack of roles that call for them?
---
Guess ill join this one

Just delete a few dick pics and you should be all set.
---
Sweeeet
---
Don’t think I will win but ok
---
5.6k comments, this feels more unlikely than Manchester united going into the europa league next season
---
It was in the Taverns of Time arena event previously
---
I believe!
---
Honestly, it's pathetic.
---
Its actually from the Taverns of Time arena event, and they brought it to battlegrounds.
---
Just giving a shot!
---
Gimme the booty
---
This issue has been resolved! If you restart the client, that should fix you right up!
---
It's supposed to get people to experiment with new decks but noone does that. Get the pirate quest? Slam every pirate into a deck and go into casual until it's done.
---
I'm also seeing the same problem when dealing with 1 gold card &amp; 1 regular. Cant even queue into games.....
---
Blizzard pls......
---
iOS is live!
---
OwO
---
F2P
---
prettymuch this. as dumb as it was that it was ever possible to queue the same opponent twice in a row, streamers babyraging over being counterqueued was the best entertainment on twitch.
---
I can't mute opponents emotes anymore
---
pls
---
But Blizzard is already taking notes XDDD!!
---
What is the complain that people are running competitive tier decks built strategically in RANKED mode? You should not be complaining that you can't just get right into the meta when you have no cards in standard and have not played for years.
---
The bottom line is, there is probably an over representation of men playing this game, despite there being many women too, so the chances of being very good at this game and to be a woman at the same time is just lower, when the talent pool in absolute numbers are smaller too.
---
Haha, at this point it seems there's no one working on fixing the bugs. So here are just a few of the "small" issues:
---
- the game on Android still moves really slow (and it has getting slower in the last couple of months), regardless of the device used or the type of connection (WiFi or mobile data);
---
- they've gotten rid of some of the daily quests so of course now we aren't getting any quests;
---
- the squelch button is broken (I don't know how on Earth they managed to break that bit maybe it is related to the Battleground mode and its emotes);
---
- there's a bug that's been in the game since almost the beginning where if you're disconnected from the game, the next time you go in the play mode of you're not paying attention you'll end up playing a game in casual mode (it seems that it defaults somehow to that option);
---
- similarly there's one where when selecting your deck it somehow defaults to the top right deck;
---
- apparently now when you have no quests you are instructed to go and play against the Inkeeper to unlock (?) new heroes (sidenote: I'm on 1000 with every hero so I would love unlocking new ones);
---
- you can flip a coin (or better role a die) and get the approximate chances of the reconnect feature to work.
---
To top it up, writing on the Blizzard forums and / or opening tickets is either ignored or handled by a "professional" that gives advices like "please try and craft that uncraftable basic card" or just says "we are aware of that".
---
At this point people should really be asking themselves if it is worth it to give this company any kind of their resources since the game quality has drastically decreased.
---
Ok, Boomer
---
As someone with a pixel 3, I can assure you my problems are not based on ram. It's really poorly optimized on mobile
---
It's not new, all free Blizzcon cards are like this.  [[Elite Tauren Chieftain]] for example.
---
MIND IF I ROLL NEEEEEED?
---
Hey Folks, we are looking into all of these issues as we speak. You're right, this definitely isn't a good experience and I'm sorry for that. 
---
I will try to provide updates as I can!

5/5/5 | Battlecry: Give both players the power to ROCK! (with a Power Chord card)  
---
Feels the same way, I would have prefered a quest to the garbage that is Sarthovarr
---
MonkaS
---
Worth a shot eh
---
we're gonna be RICH!!
---
plz gib pax
---
Yes
---
1/5600 i like those odds come on rng
---
I could definitely need more packs ^^
---
No. Not in a game like Hearthstone with rarity based deck building restrictions.
---
That sounds horrendous to play against.
---
How many "feels bad" moment have you had against Silence effects? 
---
Now imagine if instead of knocking out one or two cards it knocked out your entire deck like Gnomeferatu could against a Mecha'thun or Malygos deck.
---
It wouldn't help "balance" the game. It would make playing decks based around Uldum Quests or Hero powers feel awful.
---
I support china so pls Blizzard
---
Packs please
---
What do you have to do to get a a pack?
---
this has been popping up everywhere so why not...
---
Guess I'll have to buy the $79.99 preorder to get some packs. Oh well...
---
This is excellent! Thank you :D
---
Oko should be banned. Oops wrong reddit
---
Yes pls
---
I would love to win this!
---
Hs won't even be an esport in 5 years.
---
So far nothing said on Twitter. I now understand why Fortnite does 4:00am updates, so they can fix things during the day. Hearthstone releases it so late in the work day that everyone’s now gone and there’s nothing to be done until tomorrow. :(
---
pleeeeeease give me the looootttt thanks!
---
Craft Baku and play wild till you build up a collection. Odd Rogue is pretty cheap to craft and so long as you have Baku you can supplement with classic cards till you fill up. If you really have a bad collection craft genn. Even paladin works ok with just basic cards. I think trump had a video on it years ago.
---
ooga booga
---
Thanks
---
the squelch doesn't actually work LMAO
---
Thanks! Fingers crossed.
---
Fair enough. Just comes across as a bit assholey. Is that how you’d spell that? Assholish? Assholeish? I give up.
---
Woooooo Dragons!
---
Always worth a shot to enter these
---
K.
---
Give pack
---
I just want packs so my Tespa team can make more meme decks in the spring season lol
---
Yellow
---
The win count is based on your class, not based on which specific hero you are choosing to play
---
Gaara is back from Artifact? Hearthstone really is gaining momentum again
---
It’s a new legendary right? I was confused how it was in a classic pack.
---
First pre-order hype?
---
I have never seen this quest ever
---
I like free stuff.
