I never said tracking on 1 is bad, i said playing it mindlessly on turn 1 is bad. just playing it on turn 1 when you already have a turn 2 and 3 play is straight up bad, espescially in metas where some popular classes have several, very different, metadecks, like piratewarrior and ctrlwarrior in one meta. for example in times when zoolock and even/ctrl/handlock was a thing, YOU DO NOT TRACKING ON 1!!!! you need to know if you're digging for deadly shot/freezing vs giant and  facedamage or if you're looking for boardcontroling tools like bow/explosive etc.

---
---
That's a good way of thinking about it.

You're a broke young person.

---
Wow
---
..ok just take the 5 extra health then idiot
---
Sincerly, Bob
---
So I have HDT but I’m not able to build any suggested deck without at least 600 more dust. I was aiming for midrange hunter of which I have 19 cards. What am I supposed to be doing? Thank you so much also!
---
Shaman hero power - 1 mana draw a card - Overload (1)
---
Scepter of Summoning and the -2 mana left-hand card goggles
---
So Tracking is only good because it's a Hunter card? Ask yourself this, if Tracking was in Warlock - would anyone play it? So how are they that much different? You're just saying that classes are different, not cards.
---
Then you said nothing.
---
Sap, however, has gotten increasingly insane. Used to be, aww man, have to repay the mana for that again. But now... goddamn he’s gonna get in a lot chip damage now that I can’t interact with the board for an additional turn.
---
this picture makes no sense it's all about the discussion
---
If you haven’t fixed it yet I had the same problem. I uninstalled by going into settings-&gt;general-&gt;iPhone storage then deleted hearthstone that way. I then restarted my phone and reinstalled and it worked. Someone else posted this in an earlier thread but I can’t find it.
---
Based on the board state, and ending in a draw actually being helpful (better than losing), didn't Khadgar actually help you out then?
---
Np.  Take those 19 cards for your Midrange Hunter and either disenchant a some bad cards (also using HSR to find out quality) or just just improvise around the missing cards.
---
It has very good replayabillity and decent rewards
---
&gt;What rank are you? There's no such thing as a deck thinning hunter. Tracking helps you pick up immediate answers. The purpose is not to thin your deck.
---
1. What rank are you?
---
2. There is no such thing as a deck thinning hunter.
---
3. The purpose of tracking is to look for answers.
---
You're clearly unable to comprehend basic english so i dont think its productive to continue this conversation. Have a good day.
---
Uhuh... sure.
---
Couldn't tell you about that, but it's not surprising. I only play wild.
---
Well, the thought is not absurd if you think about value rather than digging for specific cards.
---
AI increases your hand size (number of options) by 1 for 3 mana. Warlock hero power does the same for 2 mana (and self hurt), but doesn't require a card in your deck. That's why reno lock is able to have a higher threat density than reno mage and get away with it.
---
Where did glinda crowskin come from?
---
Where’d he get the 3rd mechwarper?
---
That’s enough?
---
Only like one deck beat tempo rouge last meta, we had a meta based around that.
---
Not really; the onions cost zero instead of one, and this is rogue we're talking about, so they're great combo activators.
---
TIL the floating head is Khadgar
---
Yep, I regretted it instantly.
---
I got Alexstrasza once and it was INSANELY good on the later bosses.

The problem with making the raptors better is that hunter still can't reliably draw them after playing carnassa anyway. Adding a raptor or two to hand would have helped a lot with that.
---
Very wise comment. I'll remember this for the future. Thank you.
---
There's nothing wrong AT ALL with playing a standard deck in wild! (In fact, I think it might even make someone BETTER ... and in my opinion, it's better to get the basic cards down first THEN work with expansion cards...)
---
That and the number of people who netdeck those popular meta decks but can't play them at a high are the biggest factors into success with random bullshit. During Kobolds I went on 86-15 post nerfs with Majordomo Druid, which is an absolute meme tier deck and it didn't have the draw power of Psychmelon to grab Aviana/Majordomo and Kun from your deck. It was an 8 card combo (Aviava &gt; Kun &gt; Majordomo &gt; Clockwork Automaton &gt; Cube &gt; Faceless &gt; Faceless &gt; Deathwing &gt; Hero Power) but with the stall, ramp and armor of Druid it won against all but the strongest of aggro decks.
---
Hero Jaraxxus and minion Jaraxxus are two separate things. Hero Jaraxxus has set stats, which is how it has always worked, and it makes sense if you really think about it.
---
The regret should hit right about Turn 4
---
I think it **should** work if T5 want to be consistent.
---
When I was first starting out, I thought flamestrike was pretty bad. It didn't develop pressure, it didn't hit my opponent's face, and it was expensive at 7 mana.
---
&gt; I now should see a warning everytime
---
In a perfect world you would have an option in the menu to have the game warn you about this every time or turn the warnings off.
---
&gt;bringing them 1 draw closer to Jaina
---
This is such a silly argument lmao. Any effect that does *anything* would have some kind of "downside" that sounds worse than it is.
---
It's gold Jerry, GOLD
---
Imagine gutting your entire collection
---
??? This is not even on my top 10 list to nerf.
---
When they say sucks they dont mean its silverback level bad, they just mean the card isnt strong enough for constructed. And shark did not make the cut a month ago hence "it sucked a month ago". Peoples opinions do not matter when shark according to their data consistently underperforms.
---
In theory deleting cards (or duplitransetctetcveing all your minions) might help
---
I wonder what happens if you have the hero power upgrade treasure and baku
---
Oh, really?
---
This has been posted a lot during the previous weeks.
---
Just copying what I posted to another post...
---
Is Ticket Scalper better than Cursed Castaway in Hooktusk Rogue? They both are pretty bad to play from hand, but I always assumed Cursed Castaway was better because at least as a rush card it is functional removal.
---
It's wild... they were also at 13 health on their turn 3.

Played Yugioh before hearthstone so warlock hero power to me seems overpowered. Like you pay 1/15th your HP to draw a card? without the need to spend any other card? That's BrOkEn!!!
---
It didn't when i start out though, mostly because back then warlock have not so many good cards.
---
I would say that its a good nerf but the developers wont do it. They said Zilliax is a fair and balanced card, fun to play with but not unfun to play against
---
hdub#11725
---
NA 80g quest, i can show but you go first

Any card that reduces that cost of a card that costs 4 or more to 1 is outright broken and shouldn't exist. Prove me wrong.
---
Yes he's getting hard nerfed next patch. The rotation will be changed from clockwise to counterclockwise.
---
If you don't like to grind for cards then pay. Also holy Nova priest isnt a thing and mech hunter one of the strongest decks rn is very cheap.

It depends on the draw. If they draw all of their board clears, you lose. If you manage to Savage Roar for 20 damage early enough, you win

Thats why its 50/50? You either lose or you win. Haha. Thats exactly my point. Mulligan is very very important but if you do it correctly you can easily get a 60% Winrate against warrior.
---
It really depends on the draws at the right time. If the Warrior handles your board quick enough and doesn't have to use premium removal on trash and can save it for forests aid, they win. It happens pretty often. 
---
According to hsreplay, the warrior wins 54% of the time
---
This can be never be said enough. Armitage Shanks should sponsor a team.
---
As a strictly magic player going down r/all, I still felt that in my soul.
---
That's kind of dangerous, people are trying to make it work 'cause is a cheap, uninteractive and easy way to win, not because is fun. Blizzard will think its fun so expect a lot of support for it in the future. Blizzard should not associate popularity with fun, it's biased with all the ppl just grinding wins.
---
surprising absolutely nobody..
---
You're about to ~~play a standard deck in~~ Wild mode. ~~This is technically allowed, bur almost certainly not what you intended.~~
---
&gt; The low rolls are still at least a 0 mana, turn 1 upgraded Valeera hero power
---
Except for the times they either make you take double damage for 4 turns (Cursed Blade) or make you burn about half your deck before you can get rid of the thing (that mage staff from K&amp;C I forget the name of - I got that myself on my second game with Resourcefulness. Against the Moon Priestess, natch, so she healed away the damage I caused with the cards I didn't burn and beat my arse.)
---
Wheres my boi mech pally. Cant have RotM without [[Kangor's Endless Army]].
---
Because if i see the schedule, and the schedule spoils the score of the match, then it would be a spoiler
---
Ah, I read your initial reply too fast. I can see your point.
---
I have however decided that I need no more cards from RoS. My next craft is probably Kangor's Endless Army, to play Mech Paladin. Apart from that, I'll save my gold for the next expansion.
---
Who knows though, I might buy Dalaran at some point anyway. I think the value from Blizzard is definitely fair, agreed.

7/-/- | Resurrect 3 friendly Mechs. They keep any Magnetic upgrades.  
---
Well.. For that to happen bomb Hunter had also to be hit by the nerfs, was also suggested by Reddit, but they didn't. So obviously became dominant. Anyway, the real problem with the meta is the lack of aoe, removal and healing. That cannot be solved without an exapnsion release.
---
That would mean admitting that Wild is a lost format, something Blizzard doesn't know how to do
---
The three mana spell that deals 2-3 dmg to the enemy board, if you run into too many token druids you should put at least 1 copy of it
---
Nice
---
Like bringing a standard deck to a modern fnm.
---
Very helpful thanks
---
r/477 now introducing r/21433614336
---
Tekahn has a line of dialogue when you use the spell Cataclysm, something like the time of cataclysm has come again.
---
In typical Blizzard fashion, it's misspelled.
---
Control is when you try to drag out the game as long as possible trough defensive minions, direct damage and boardclears, until you can either pull of an otk or just krush your opponent with big minions
---
Ok so basically you have the choice between 
---
1) Tempo / Aggro Decks
---
2) Midrange 
---
3) Control
---
Depends on what Playstyle you prefer and if you care about climbing the ladder fast or if rank is somewhat irrelevant.
---
Let me elaborate on that.
---
Let's say you like to be the guy who enjoys control heavy Playstyle and really think about your turns as well as your opponent turns. This is gonna be tough at the beginning because you'll have a slow learning curve simply because there are a ton of things to consider while playing. 
---
If you're now thinking yea that sounds like me but I shy away from being too slow or want something at least a bit easier to for Midrange decks.
---
Or you'll be like fuck all that I wanna smash my opponents face SMOrc. Well then welcome to Tempo / Aggro Decks. 
---
If you can decide between these 3 I can give you some deck suggestions
---
I can personally vouch for the fact that standard oddadin would get you to rank 5 in wild.
---
finally concocted the perfect deck (by chance) to beat heroic HSS: went with warlock, got rocket boots and robes of gaudiness as treasures along with two rins. drew rin turn 1, played it on turn 6 and traded it off on the same turn and spammed the seals over the next 3 turns. managed to play azari on turn 9. victory has never felt so sweet
---
If 1 is Boomsday and 3 is Doomsday...
---
2nd expansion Coomsday confirmed!
---
Ohh ok thanks!
---
Mindbreaker's ability is ignored in single player because of how much bosses rely on their hero powers.
---
Np!
---
Just go to your collection and select the deck. Select "Copy" and paste it in a reply. :)
---
Neither does tall tales, learnt these the hard way
---
Yea, I see Bethesda releasing Skyrim on Nokia first
---
&gt;Do you enjoy chucking burn damage at face?
---
Yes, to almost sexual degree, I play mostly Mage.... what do you mean aggro Shaman? :(
---
I actually don't think it has much to do with "how to make games" even ignoring that statement doesn't hold well with how much is with supporting Dota2 and CS:GO.
---
The game was not F2P which made it hard for completely new players to give a niche genre a try and also meant for existing card game players that is money on something unproved and untested vs just spending that money on the game they are already playing. That right there already heavily doomed it to get solid starting numbers besides reviewers and day1 streamers, also a bunch of the day1 numbers was because of the launch benefits it gave to existing Dota2 players.
---
There are other issues with the game that then hurt it being able to recover from this like initial confusing watcher experience, the additional price for cards, etc. I still honestly don't think much of it is because of the "core gameplay" itself or things that wouldn't/couldn't be fixed to have it have a carving of the market. It is more it was just such an awful launch and designed way to much like traditional card games in economics that it was already doomed.
---
The real hearthstone killer is mtg arena as soon as they make a phone port
---
decklists ??
---
Dota Underlords is Valves Autochess, and those games are very much competing with Hearthstone.
---
Artifact should be taught in business schools how NOT to make, promote and develop a game. Bad timing, overlying too much on the Valve name, relying too much on Streamer feedback(of course they would kiss your ass for that sweet exclusivitiy), disastrous monetary system and so on and so on.

If you don't want to talk about it, you don't have too. I'm not like, personally victimized by Snip Snap, I just question it's usefulness in mech paladin. We were having a little discussion about that. It's a little weird to hang out on a hearthstone forum and then get defensive when people try to talk to you about hearthstone decks.
---
Annoyest-o-tron
---
So glad to read this news, wish you succeed on this.
---
Yeah, just tryed a Version of Control Heal Paladin with Kangors army and the Imortal prelate combo. 
---
It’s ridiculous how easy Warrior can clear the army ( with Eggs) without even brawling, when every Mech has rush ( mainly Omegadevastator) .
---
This is really what it comes down to. The only reason I'm playing Hearthstone at this point is because of mobile. If MtG Arena gets a phone client I'm instantly downloading it.
---
Thats fine dude it just sounded like yoh were getting sorta mad
---
is it possible to learn this power
---
I felt god like
---
Well, there are many decks that would love to play three loot hoarders if they could
---
 alcolitoz#1785 , Trading quest on NA, I´ll show, u go first, pls no scameroni.
---
Loving that Christmas tree
---
I have to agree with this, he's clearly got a substantial board going and needed that armor.
---
Until you hit the 25 second a turn hero, then you gotta wait until you have some uninterrupted time.
---
Reynad in fact really disliked Artifact and had very good points as to why he felt that way. They've never really addressed any of those.
---
Woulda been a great deal if only OP had saved enough life to pay the piper (or bomber in this case).
---
Blitz is improving actually HS when you consider the design choices of past compared vs now.
---
Just look at how first it was Jade Druid ( bad design) then Hadronox Druid ( bit better design) and now Lucentbark Druid ( good design)
---
The sad thing is that it took so fucking damn long for them to come up with fair and interesting design.
---
I have a meta crusher mech paladin that isnt on this diagram, but ok.
---
I love this theory, and I'm 100% percent on the Tekahn bandwagon. BUT the devs have said a couple of times that the second expansion will be focused on the heroes. How would you connect the Titan theme with some heroic themes?   
---
Heres my take: League of Explorers 2: Electric Boogaloo! Elise and Sir Finley track some McGuffin to the facilities.  When they arrive there the League of E.V.I.L. already stole it, so Elise picks her pager and calls the Hearthvengers:  
---
* Elise &amp; Sir Finley
---
* Darius Crowley or Genn Greymane
---
* Marin the Fox or Master Oakheart
---
* Some Rastakhan Champion Thekal or Loti maybe
---
* Aya Blackpaw or Kazakus
---
* Fjola Lightbane or Justicar Trueheart
---
magic's rules are too antiquated and slow to kill hearthstone
---
Imagine your phone trying to figure out a infinite token generator
---
Dota Underlords is shitting on HS right now so maybe Valve will have the last laugh.
---
They'd have to get really creative with the UI. I think the HS team did a fantastic job of porting the desktop version of the game down to a smartphone form factor, especially on iOS devices.
---
So can the MtG condense some of that down? I think there are ways, but it will take some real sit-down-and-thinking on how to get all those mechanics to fit nicely on a small screen and yet keep things nice and visible. Especially when you do things like search through your deck and stuff.
---
I thought they didn't even know what it would cost until like week before launch like everyone else. And the cost was least of their problems, it's one of the worst games to watch and playing it is exhausting with RNG that really leaves bad taste in your mouth when it goes wrong.

Hi not a fan of artifact at all (played 8hrs and deleted it), but i feel like you are gloating miserable kid who gets some unbelievable level of satisfaction seeing someone else failures. the tried to make a good game, they failed. its life., I'm dad.
---
Isn't there a MtG-lite type of mobile offering that exists? I thought there was.
---
I really tried to play it. Returned my money after 40 minutes, before even completing the tutorial (40 minutes wasn't enough), because it's so slow, and animations take forever. And the cards don't make any sense, like stats and abilities not even remotely related to Dota.
---
As someone who did try artifact I feel kinda... satisfied? It benefits the overall health the gaming community worldwide when games with overtly greedy/predatory business models tank, the higher profile the better. At the very least it draws a line in the sand and sends a message that any effort worse than that, by a smaller company need not even try.
---
If you want all the top tier decks, then yeah. There's too many viable decks and too many cards. But ftp is pretty reasonable, and after playing for a little while you can craft a couple good decks to play with. That's just standard, though, there are other formats like pauper (common cards only) that are a lot of fun and really cheap to get into.
---
I remember watching that stream because Savjz hyped it up beforehand. I watched it, and the commentators did little to help people understand what was happening in the game or why. It was a reveal stream meant to get people into the game, and they didn't explain what cards did, how the strategy worked, what the mechanics were. There was no acknowledgement that people watching definitely have not played the game. Couldn't enjoy or watch it.

I checked a bunch of numbers on Artifact and other games a month ago and at least, by my math, Artifact is the biggest triple-A flop in at least 10 years, at least for those games whose numbers we can track via steam charts. I could not find any other game in existence who numbers tanked at the level Artifact's. Artifact managed to lose 93% of its players within only 2 months of releasing, and an incredible 99% within 4 months. Nothing else comes even close. Even popular flops like No Man's Sky, Fallout 76, or Battleborn retained far more of their initial player base than this. I can't even imagine the chaos that must have resulted from this internally at Valve.
---
Artifact is the XFL of digital card games. Spend so much time and money calling yourself the "Hearthstone killer" and deriding your opponent and not on developing a quality product.
---
This has to be the lowest of low hanging fruits. Let Artifact rest in peace and be forgotten. Do Hearthstone players really need to boost their egos by comparing their game to a dead-on-arrival one?
---
You actually get packs now by playing and leveling up your profile
---
LMAOOOO I love this chart "How often do you watch Disguised Toast?"
---
I thought they kinda have that issue already resolved (the no-limits on permanents thing) right on desktop. Maybe place a counter beside them on mobile format?
---
I'm sure there's a way. Oh not saying it's easy, but they are giving up a good chunk of the playerbase but not having it available on mobile. Although if they did say they are no plans, then very likely that decision was made very early on(vs HS' early plans to be both desktop and mobile from the get-go).
---
Then it would be far too much to then backtrack and then try to redesign a mobile version.
---
Can you give more info what happened?
---
What's Wildstar?
---
is it at least half as generous as hearthstone with free packs, not that hearthstone throws too many free packs at us
---
Yes, but they introduced a lot more non-drawing spells since then as well.
---
No, it's intentional so that op decks aren't suddenly replaced by a much weaker Zayle deck.
---
No, no, *THIS* is the WoW killer. Wait. I mean, *this* is the wow killer. Hang on, I meant *thiiiis* is the WoW killer.
---
So, a case study?
---
It could be doable if they can come up with clever ways to show board state. Like we don't literally need a board with cards on it. Maybe a minimal view with lists of cards in each zone that you can highlight for a larger view or something and counters for mana and life and such.
---
After playing the game for a while you almost remember exactly what most cards do anyways. It would take some getting used to at first but yea that upfront design and development cost might no be currently worth it to them.
---
~~i was overwhelmed alright~~
---
Can someone tell me why the Shirvallah + Holy Wrath lists recently started running Elven Archer?

---
I wish. The next turn he sac pacted his Voidcaller into Mal’ganis. I can’t think of a better opener for my opponent.
---
WOOOO
---
I wanted to Open the Eye's the HS community that other sites that promote HS cups can be run just as good as Battlefy.
---
Intern the hope is to expand the HS community in both Challonge and the OSC Hearthstone Community too, expand the player base, and offer opportunities for Community casters too to cast the tournaments.
---
I ray of frosted his Voidcaller, hoping that he couldn’t kill it off but he just had Sac Pact for it anyway :(
---
True, I just wanted to highlight the unlikelyness of this exact outcome for my opponent.
---
Yeah it shut down recently after converting to F2P. Knew it had a way longer lifespan than "months".
---
Another big difference is Druid had/has a bunch of survivability with all the armor gain, Spreading Plague, Malfurion, etc. With all the Odd Paladin and Murloc Shamans in Wild atm I've been doing pretty well with it.
---
It's been a bit since I played Pogo Rogue so correct me if something changed, but all that deck had was Reno Jacksoning yourself Zilliax onto a big ass Pogo. And usually you'd just die before that happens.
---
F
---
Yeah, HS is designed with mobile in mind even though they didn't have mobile at the beginning.
---
I don’t get people who say the monetization of artifact is bad. Anyone seriously playing a TCG has to see that artifact is way cheaper in the long run than Magic Arena or Hearthstone. No rng packs, buy the cards you want.
---
Now if you want to criticize the lack of incentives to play on a daily basis( daily quests etc) you have a valid complaint. Not every game has to be F2P.
---
Fair - more curious about outcomes on match quality and matchups at skill floors and ceilings. Anecdotally it seems like matches get weirder and more memey when you've fallen to 1 star in any given rank and get played more straightforwardly when you're rising. This might be just rank psychology - when people are at the bottom of a rank, they have less to lose and play goofball decks and go for bizarre combos and OTKs. I know I did all of my misbegotten lackey rogue experimentation at the bottom of 15. 
---
And yes, I think the devs have straight-up said that matchmaking is unaffected by deck type so this is probably just a combination of my own confirmation bias and the power of warriors and mages right now. 
---
I am just very irritated that I can play basically the same deck, same strat, for an evening and get radically different outcomes within the same basic 5-rank tier. After factoring for my own failures and for RNG (bad draws, unwinnable matchups, coin flip), it leaves me wondering what is happening behind the scenes that could have some sort of nudge as I climb and fall. The same question for when I'm rising, because that's obviously not 100% because of my own skills (for the same reasons).
---
Didn't the warhammer mmo always your itself as the wowkiller?
---
I think this has been a suggestion for almost 2 years now.
---
But now that their bufffing cards...
---
Everything wrong with Hearthstone encapsulated. I used to really enjoy this game, but stuff like makes the game unplayable. I want to play, but then something like this happens as well, and it really ruins the experience. I wish instead of nerfing cards all the time, they could severely rotate cards that allow these sorts of combos to occur, irregardless of which set they belong to. I’m worried that if nothing else changes, the addition of new cards will just allow for even more powerful combos to occur.
---
Eternal Card Game is pretty good actually. Their marketing sucks though - it's not as well known as it could be.
---
It has some great ideas and a very generous f2p model. Worth checking out!
---
I think this is because the lead guy was the guy behind mtg. He seemed to think that monetizing artifact was the same as a physical card game, and valve agreed. Hopefully Valve learns their lesson and improves the next time they launch.
---
You're right, I may be overreacting since I didn't have my personal chance to play it. I love Dota's Autochess but I don't play normal Dota so I don't have the battle pass nor access to Underlods. But I've been watching gameplay, streams and some opinions about the game, and I don't like how it's looking and how they pulled off the release. It may be better than what I said tho. Sorry if I overreacted.
---
I did the heroic first try with tekhan and second try on normal with him both times i had gaud robes and with the draw hero power you never run out of cards
---
Hmm, I've yet to look into it, but I've loved MTG since I played when revised came out.  I was getting obsessed a few years back and spending too much money on it and I finally decided to sell and move on.
---
But... Would mtga be a good fit?  What's the cost to get into it and maintain a collection?
---
A minion with taunt is calling you.
---
What kind of art are you wanting maybe I could be of some help?
---
Ya, not talking about MtGO.  That'll probably be continued for quite a bit longer, but when Duels wasn't doing enough to compete with HS they just cut off support for it to switch to Arena, fucking anyone who spent money.  No reason to believe they won't do the same with Arena if it fails to hit whatever goals they have for it.
---
&gt;In the past he was one of the guys who did a TMZ-ish gossip column on the Starcraft 2 scene called "eSex" or something like that(it was years ago during Starcraft 2's heyday). The website is long gone. 
---
I am not really sure if you're just completely misinformed, or trying to play an elaborate joke on people. But since you're directly calling someone out I'm just going to go ahead and correct you for the sake of everyone who doesn't know what you're talking about.
---
ESEX, which stands for eSports Express, was neither TMZ-ish nor a gossip column. It was a comedy site trying to be something like *The Onion* but for eSports. The site is also still online, here you go: [http://esportsexpress.com/](http://esportsexpress.com/) 
---
I will admit, the eSports scene would be a lot more fun if headlines like *Overwatch Director Becomes Supervillain, “Sudden Death”* or *WESA Reassures Esports World with Plans to Definitely Not Take over World* were real, but that's not where we're at.
---
He did indeed tried to take it to kickstarter. First for SC2, which failed in part due to reasons mentioned, then for DOTA2, which reached its funding goal: [https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/hotbid/created](https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/hotbid/created) 
---
I don't know what happened after the DOTA2 success. The site hasn't been updated in three years, but the kickstarter campaign was five years ago, so they lasted a bit after that.
---
Some of their Starcraft stuff was hilarious, but it was all so deeply embedded in the community that I can't imagine there was much of a market for it even in the bigger eSports community. We're talking like three layers down on the niche level.

Cmon man, we’re memeing here, not suggesting literally the best card in the game
---
It took me about a year of playing paper magic before I really had a feel for the stack, phases and priority. Mtgarena is supposed to ease this since you don't have to manually keep track of things, but it's not doing a good job at explaining what's happening behind the scenes.
---
I never said it was on a downturn, I'm referring to this from the source you provided:
---
&gt;2016 — In Hasboro's earning report, they state there are 1 million registered DCI players, and 65,000 playing in the grand prix. You must figure there are 10 to 20 casual players for every serious DCI player, putting the estimates in the 15-21 million range
---
He also states that there are the same number of players in 2014. I couldn't confirm either way whether the games growing, shrinking or just maintaining it's numbers, I'm just skeptical of the numbers he's provided as he's given no source. Even he says he hasn't cited his sources:
---
&gt;In order to do this, I had to do some research on the size of the community. I found random articles all over the place, **which of course I did not site**. This is what I've found:
---
I'm not trying to shit on MTG at all btw, I actually think it's a far superior game to HS and would like to see it get more popular and keep growing, but any uncited source is fishy to me.
---
I apologize. I thought I was replying to the person who was claiming that Magic did not need Arena.
---
Why would business schools teach you how to develop a game
---
Ok, thought you were the same guy I was responding to who was claiming the downturn happened. You are correct that some of the exact data there is suspect, mostly because MTG does not release exact numbers. But my point was that the game is still growing strong, not to prove exact numbers ever.
---
Opening hand was cyclone/cyclone/images/coin/evoc. Draw was magic trick. Trick in to tome of int, coin, tome in to second evoc, evoc, cyc, evoc, cyc.
---
Yeah I've tried it and would be all for it but if I can't play it anywhere except in private for fear of being judged it's just not as appealing as Hearthstone.
---
i play wild and i dont want it either
---
Duels was super limited in many aspects and didn’t appeal to people who like to dig deep into magic. I love magic, hated duels, and love arena. Arena is also insurmountably more popular than duels ever was. I don’t see it going away.
---
Not that was me, but I'm saying that I didn't make up those numbers, the claim to those numbers was made by someone else, I was just referring to them.
---
Pogo’s buff made it a bit to good I think
---
stormwind champion
---
Yes i know... 
---
I just think that is a bit sad that a game which has almost all of the things that people here want in a big HS competitor just because a, good chunk admitedly, looks "to anime" for Europe and USA and acts like repellent.  
---
There are [cards](https://sv.bagoum.com/getRawImage/0/0/112541030) [like](https://sv.bagoum.com/getRawImage/0/0/900841100) [these](https://sv.bagoum.com/getRawImage/0/0/900211030) which aren't even uncommon, but get overloked because other cards  look [like](https://sv.bagoum.com/getRawImage/0/0/107831010) [this](https://sv.bagoum.com/getRawImage/0/0/101611010), a very petty reason to ditch everything that it does right all things considered, but a valid reason nonetheless...
---
If rng would have been the problem ha should be dead too. The worst parts of Artifact were the economy model and the lack of progression (ladder, systems to use to increase collection, etc).
---
RegisKillbin commissions art to post on his twitter, It's always HS-related. I'd check out his twitter @regiskillbin
---
Didn't Wizards of the Coast just come out with Valor's Reach this year?
---
Okay what's the downside? He makes jokes that some people will laugh at? Oh the horror! As we all know, causual audiences take games far more seriously than anybody else!
---
Snarmy sarcasm aside, do you really not see the benefit of comic relief/brevity in an area that already has a lot of tension and seriousness? Like casuals are just that, casual. They don't take it as serious as everyone else, so a break in all the tension is needed.
---
They cut Duels because Arena encompasses everything Duels was and more. They had been weaning off support for the client for years while conveying all along that Arena was coming. Anyone who felt blindsided by the change was a very small percentage of the player base and were completely out of touch with everything else going on in the game around them.
---
Get paladin, pick the divine shield hero power.
---
Get offered robes of gaudiness and the +1/+1 buff
---
Pick buff spells.
---
Pick grimmer patron.
---
Buff grimmer patron with the “always starts in you hand”, “give +2/+2”, “add 3 copies into your deck” from Bob.
---
Hopefully play a turn 1 6/6 that the AI can’t answer, divine shield and buff it, and hope the AI doesn’t have brawl, freeze + doomsayer, or any kind of board clear.
---
Seriously, that’s how I beat it on Heroic after like 8 tries.
---
Right there with ya.  First 3 looked great.  Last 2?  I'm playing a card game not an underage fetish game.  Magic Arena took me away from hearthstone the moment it came out though so I'm not upset.  I love MTG, probably much more than I would like shadowverse regardless of the art.

if i go to my twitch inventory i see packs...what about you guys? nothing in game yet though
---
Smaller drying up rivers, Debatable successes.  Proplayers and streamers tell everything you need to know.   I know this is a HS sub and I will draw hate, but pros and streamers are leaving for a reason: tic tac toe sucks.
---
I want to feel good about my insecure self, so I am going to bash another game.  Even though my own game is dying slowly with longer queue times, less money coming in, less interest overall, and with a player base learning how much of a worthless company Blizzard has become.  Right OP I believe that sums up your pointless post perfectly :-)
---
Valve sucks at making games. They got lazy and greedy after HL2 abd Steam launch.
---
Is the cap two packs regardless of how much I watch this weekend?
---
Is there a bracket link?
---
It has lore in the same way that Destiny has lore.  If you take the time to read a lot of wikis and websites there's this amazing backstory and world-building going on.  Just is meaningless in relation to what's going on in the game.
---
\*cough\* DOTA 2 \*cough\*
---
Yes, not wanting to play a game with dragon Lolis is petty... 
---
You can’t pretend that aesthetics are just as important as gameplay for a vast majority of people.
---
Don’t know what pros or streamers are you talking about, all I have always know keep on playing. 😂
---
Highly competitive AND nice to work with? Hmmm .. sounds like a unicorn to me. 
---
I'm excited to see who gets the job though.
---
I have no idea, since Blizzard doesn't report numbers. But if we're discussing MAU vs copies purchased than I think HS would win out by virtue of being F2P and on mobile. OW is extremely stagnant gameplay wise and the OWL is the biggest esports bubble since the pre MLG days. I think OWL and the Call of Dury franchised league that Activision is pushing next year will burst the bubble and very few titles will be safe. I think League, Dota, and CS will survive the fallout but the smaller titles like Gears of War and CoD are fucked.
---
2 packs guaranteed (at three hours each), and a chance for more packs every hour.
---
Just have cards missing and exit out of the deck building and it will prompt
---
Having to go online to make competent decks is the biggest loser noob move in the book
---
&gt;people were heralding it as the Hearthstone killer
---
Pretty weird generalization, most of the conversations that I read around Artifact (even by valve fanboys) was a much more realistic view. Nobody who thought it through for more than 10 seconds realised that Artifact is targeting a whole different demographic, it was pc-first, it was pay upfront, no f2p grind at all, and it was very complex.
---
The true Artifact fanboys were more on the opinion that it's a 200IQ exclusive niche intellectual game and HS is for the dumb masses and pleb f2p grinders.
---
So I'd rather say *some people* were heralding it as the Hearthstone killer. But some people also put pineapple on pizza or love getting kicked in the balls, so there you go.
---
well... if he has 4 health his armour can take a billion damage at one and he survives, so...
---
Thank you very much!
---
It's more a story of two fanbases.  Hearthstone has a lot of loyal fans as it popularized the CCG genre, and Valve has a lot of very loyal fans as well.  When Valve announced Artifact this sub had months of posts about how Lord GABEN was going to save all us poor lootbox scum and show us how a proper CCG was done.  But when Artifact came out, it was an utter flop.  Laughable monetization, ridiculous passive RNG and one of the boring gameplay loops ever presented.  So now all the HS fans have a collective laugh periodically as we remember Artifact as the most greedy and incompetent CCG released.
---
Yes, and there has never been a need to dig for that damage. Unless you have too much tech or don't commit to the strength of the hero.
---
If there is a situation where you are struggling as hunter, you will be running out of cards fast, and I don't thinks it's wise to make the card value disparity worse with Tracking. Other draw options, and card creation, is better than throwing away cards on a chance. Unless the meta is easy for face hunter, then go ahead. I'll still make fun of those that throw away  2 cards for a draw 1. Even warlock gets value from discarding these days.
---
It's ok that you personally like it.
---
But Heroes of the Storm is a failled game
---
Wot if, we had a good Yu-Gi-Oh game

The artifact tag on twitch was being used for so many other things besides artifact that it just died on twitch.

I'd really like for it to get the Molten Giant un-nerf now that it's in Wild, I liked playing Russian Roulette with him against my buddy.
---
MTGO requires buying the games and cards. But MTGO is a beast from a different era and Magic players are addicts that will pay for their fix. Also MTGO offer the ability to exchange for physical paper cards.
---
Imo Shaman has better C'Thun kit.
---
Also extremely prevalent in the first Lich King fight.
---
Tho to be fair the game they did finish is bigger than DOTA despite being the worse built game.
---
It was a joke on the whole "you think you do but you don't" comment for vanilla WoW.
---
Ah ok, I missed the deck when I looked at the page the first time. I saw some builds that incorporated Fel Reaver, but idk, feels a bit risky. I might be mistaken tho. Coming to think of it, I feel one Piloted Shredder could be a candidate to substitute for Flying Machine. I think I seldom play Piloted Shredder (I often prioritise the other 4-drops I think)
---
Got mine immediately
---
Nice!  I just drafted Paladin with a very similar deck and Tirion.  Hoping for 7+ for sure (which means I'll probably get 2 or 3).
---
I agree with the statement that Big Priest is gatekeeping T1, but it itself is not because people tech so hard against it.
---
I play a fuckton of wild, infact, it is the only game mode I will play.
---
Although, my opinion is probably skewed since my preferred deck and archetypes have always been Anti-Big Priest. I like Combo Decks and Aggro Decks. My Aggro Decks casually have on-board lethal by turn 4, so I don't give a fuck about the whole Barnes High-Rolly shit since I just kill them for playing it in the first place. And my Combo Decks can stall out the game long enough to vaporize them most of the time. I just have to Dodge the Barnes -&gt; Y'Sharajj/Caterina -&gt; Y'Sharajj/Ragnaros on turn 4.
---
Do you have lethal?
---
Except Heroes of the Storm didn’t lose 99% of its playerbase 4 months after its release. It’s not a succesful game, but it’s still alive and well after many years.
---
1. As u/chasmang already said, your rank and stars and the only deciding factor when it comes to matchmaking. However, at rank floors you will see more meme decks, as people like to mess around after hitting their goals for the month.
---
2. It may seem like it (a lot), but your deck doesn't affect your matchmaking. First, that would really be hard to code, and second, if it really is rigged for bad matchups all the time, then why are your opponents getting good matchups?
---
3. It can be beneficial to tech in cards if you're seeing a lot of a certain deck at a rank bracket. Usually this is really only useful at ranks 3-1 though, and it helps me a lot more to just take a break. You might see different decks and you'll definitely be less tilted. And try to use the same deck, too. You might snag a good matchup every now and then if you switch, but you'll get better faster if you stick to mastering one archetype.
---
I legit forgot Artifact was a real thing until just now.  What a disaster
---
That’s what they get for not making it free
---
Valvo is so out of touch with their own audience tbh. They even fail to negociate auto chess original creator. So rich but don't knoe how to spend. Only take never give.

Huh, my opponent just didn't care about the taunt and kept hitting me
---
I'm upvoting for the discussion but I gotta disagree. I actually think Magic is less generous than both Hearthstone and Eternal, for both Constructed and Limited formats.
---
Dust alone completely outshines anything MTGA can possibly offer for Constructed, and trying to play Limited without spending IRL money is way more of a time sink.
---
- MTG has (almost) no random effects
---
- In Standard and Modern, you can have each card four times
---
- A hell of a lot more draw mechanics than HS
---
- You are allowed to declare blockers (which I think is an immense factor in removing a larger factor of RNG)
---
- You can control the game even outside your turn via instants or cards with flash
---
If you're drawing too little mana, you've got too little of it in your deck. If you're drawing only one colour in a multicoloured deck, cards like Evolving Wilds, or double-coloured lands, etc. can be added to the deck to make up for it.
---
the game consistently reaches 80 players! i wouldnt call that dead

It didn't die. It's not a bug.

I'm pretty done with the game, only playing to get my quests done so I can buy packs at the expansion drop.
---
Don't enjoy watching anymore, but they got me for 6 hours for packs.
---
It's probably just an example, but balancing the numbers are likely the least important part of a card's design, and also a rather pointless exercise given the cards on that sub aren't actually going to be played.
