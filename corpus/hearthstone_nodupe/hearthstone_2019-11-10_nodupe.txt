I went hard into Wild sometime after The Witchwood and have loved being able to escape standard metas I don't enjoy for cards I've loved playing throughout hearthstone history.
---

---
Diversity of formats is why Magic: the Gathering has thrived for so long, and hearthstone needs to take some notes on how to support their formats other than standard (and then give those notes to MTG Arena but that's a different story).

Another prominent [ex-HS player](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/9m7tjp/why_noxious_wont_play_hearthstone_gwent_or/) returning to play the new game mode.
---
Yep and I'm still downvoted... OK...
---
I started playing wild for 2 reasons, 1st I missed playing my Highlander and Quest decks, and 2nd, I thought that monthly rewards were given separately from Wild and Standard, the logic was telling me that. Big was my surprise when after a month I discovered that you only received rewards for one mode.
---
My suggestion to help wild would be that, give monthly rewards separately from standard, I'm sure a lot of people would play the mode more frecuently and discover the vast amazing variety of decks.

If you hadn't stoped playing you too could have a bigger and better collection. Those people with complete decks at rank 20 most likely do not care at all with ranking, therefore they hover arround rank20, only playing enough for the 5 wins and thats it.
---
Even if you are not happy with the meta, like me, you can still play tavern brawl, arena, solo or even casual and keep doing your daily quests and hording gold for the next expansion, this way you are less likely to fall behind.
---
I have three straight 60g quests since the patch update. I still got one or two 50g quests. That's my anecdote at least.
---
you'd make things a lot easier on him if you used standard decks and didn't make him collect a ton more cards to work in your preferred format
---
at first at least.

I got a drop from watching a VoD, then streamed it and one of my viewers got a drop.
---
Hi. We don't care either.
---
Regards, Hearthstone streamers.
---
Play rogue and just dab an execute on that baby
---
It’s great when you double battlecry those with shudderwock
---
He told me he just wants to battle me with some of my other decks, he doesn't care if he loses or not.
---
Which one did you play first? You need to play summoning portal first and then mechwarper. The opposite doesn't work and it will stay at 1 Mana.
---
It’s hard to explain until you play it, but it has that “Just one more game ...” appeal to it. 
---
It’s much better to play than it is to watch, imo.
---
But I also agree that the game will need more wrinkles in it. More minions that attack in predictable ways, minions that trigger AOE when poisoned, minions that get bonuses against certain tribes, etc.
---
Does a win streak do anything like give you an extra gold?
---
I see a lot of potential in it, but it’s coming out relatively soon. I wonder how much more they could really do to it in the meantime. I mean, I’m not going to complain too much about another free mode though.
---
Why not use the borrow decks feature so he can try your decks out?
---
&gt; 5-10-15-20g for coming in top four.
---
Hahahahahahahahaha
---
I've gotten all 60 gold quests too since the update. It seems like there are more 60 gold quests relative to 50 gold quests now, which I think is pretty cool.
---
is taunt warrior not at all viable? into the fray and bolster make it an okay tempo deck. it has wincons against most decks. ill try to take it to legend
---
I was wondering if that was the case too. The streamers look like they’re having a blast with it.

I just tried to play a game with hunter for play 3 games with hunter mage or druid quest and it didn't count it for the quest
---
Didn't pray hard enough to RNGesus I guess
---
I don't play wild, so can you help me out with this one?
---
Hmm I wonder if mechs might be a bit too strong
---
To me comparative wild is the 5 to legend climb, outside of top 50.
---
You have to keep in mind that this sub is generally garbage at arena.
---
It is definitely possible to have 0 left in the pool if enough other players buy the same item. It is a certain number of each. But they do go back in the pool if the player dies.
---
Thank you for the kind feedback, glad you're doing it as well! So much downtime between rounds makes sense right! Steal away all good!
---
I used to be that way (played wild since its inception up until this rotation, even hit legend once) but playing against certain decks for so long made me sick after a while and I feel like there's a bigger difference between what's viable and what isn't than in standard (due to the lower powerlevel). Wild really felt like a dumping ground for some of Hearthstone's dumbest cards
---
I'm worried about that as well, it's been a long time since I exercised just gonna do whatever feels right and keep moving burning those calories. Battlegrounds has great downtime work it up!
---
does golden bran do 3 battlecries or something?
---
That's exactly the point. Snip is fine as long as it never goes down to 0 so why not just add on "*(This card's cost cannot be reduced below 1)*"
---
Letting the wild cards around (evolve, n'zoth) for 2 months was a mistake. Right now I'm torn between grinding gold in a stale meta or just doing dailies and loosing some ground for the next expansion. Descent of dragons looks promising though. With galakrond, dragons, quests and highlanders I hope every class gets multiple viable decks.

There's a guaranteed legendary in the first 10 packs from the same expansion, that could be a good way to get a deck-defining legendary or atleast some dust
---
Lol, we're doing this for blizzard now?
---
The auto battler genre still hasn't really figured out the most optimal way of monetizing.
---
If I had to guess, I'd say they should try something cheap like a subscription or battle pass where you can earn cosmetics for the game mode, so as to lessen the burden on whales who they've been relying on to buy packs each expansion.
---
I have nothing to add, but everything you said would be very fun and would probably get more of my friends to play Hearthstone.
---
Context: recent update has brought almost My some new bugs, this happens EVERY TIME I load up the game.
---
Rhetoric question, sh&lt;&lt;&lt;it eating ret&lt;&lt;&lt;ard. How do i counter a 30 damage one turn kill on turn 9 you stupid piece of sh&lt;&lt;&lt;it
---
Agree it should do more damage then 2 damage. Or maybe it changes your hero power to where you can do 2 damage to any enemy but if it is a certain tribe it counts as posion.
---
I have a few, but still get people with better combos (like double health and then switch it to atack) .
---
I dont get what dust means , after it how do i get more?
---
Thank you , i wont buy any of it till then!
---
I did not play Wild much last season, instead switching to the Arena, and I'm going to continue this season. Tired of the meta.
---
oh cool a new legendary that no one has ever seen played before.
---
Just be glad you didn't get -0.
---
he's a 5 mana 6-3 that will occasionally work as an assassinate. Beasts are not as big as dragons, which makes it worse.
---
He's like a much worse version of vilespine.
---
As someone who has played a good amount of that priest deck for the past month, like others have mentioned, your deck is a terrible matchup for it. That priest deck is super greedy and extremely vulnerable to aggro decks, but will decimate decks like your zoo deck. The strengths of your deck (board control and being able to repeatedly build wide boards) are easily handled by that priest deck. Basically your only chance is if they draw terribly, not getting their 5 &amp; 6 cost minions. 
---
If your deck is otherwise working fine for you, I would say stick with it and just accept any game against that priest deck as an automatic loss. If you start playing against that deck a lot, then I would consider switching decks.
---
But should they? If you come in fourth like OP did, *middle of the pack* against players who're worse than you on-average, do you deserve a reprieve?
---
Sort of feeds into why I think it's smarter that games just not show you your MMR. I don't see a lot of gain in knowing it, while there's a serious downside of it being frustrating, arcane, and confusing to not be rising / falling too much when you think the opposite should be true.
---
Blizz can't even keep standard working correctly, let alone hopes for wild.
---
[removed]
---
Gotta pick between an eternal format or a balanced format
---
A comma. 
---
That’s the funny part!
---
One of the things BG has going for is that if it can naturally increase the users of Hearthstone and as a result create more customers for the base game then it will not need to be monetized in any particular way.
---
It's a bug, the mmr showing is more than you had before. Happened to me as well
---
non evolved 1 cost means shaman was not quick enough
---
You should play the game after the update

It will now be part of your [[Soul Warden]] card pool.

---
it's a strategy, it's meant to throw your game off subconsciously  and you fell for it, try to remain calm when facing these people.  the are simply using bad sportsmanship to get the better of you.
---
oh you were thinking in legal implications? I thought you were saying that 
---
 it was extremely hard to implement a system to rig games software-wise.
---
I've not played it, only watched a fair bit, but Battlegrounds right now seems really restricting on what is actually playable. I feel like I'll get bored of it very fast unless they add more cards to make additional, viable strats
---
I actually misread it as first; first should always get some token progression. It's smarter to put a mask on top of your MMR like League of Legends. I think it's fine if fourth doesn't get progression in an edge case. The other option is probably for OP to have an increased queue time.
---
I dunno man... I could've sworn I've seen people delete accounts dropping that topdecked Reno at 1 health.
---
Nah, I shoulda been more specific, I exaggerated obviously
---
If Northshire Cleric's stat line is getting in your way as an aggro player, you weren't going to win anyway.
---
A 4 mana 4/4 isn't much of a tempo or value loss either though, so I don't think that's that big of an issue at all.
---
Its fine, i just hate how annoying is my mute button didnt work. Is just for me or everyone is having the same problem?
---
i would like to have a more articulate UI. I would like to be able to watch my replays to study my moves, track my cards during games etc etc. It is way too simplistic as it is.
---
Yea. My turn timer comment is mostly referring to the later rounds when you may sit tight for ~60 sec with nothing to do. An early turn with many decisions can feel tight.
---
Like you said, I definitely do not know how the timer works. My main issue is all the potential dead time. Sure, when I have to step away for a bit, that time is convenient, but when I'm locked in, it's kind of jarring to wait for THAT long.
---
If they really need the timer to be so long, I'd feel even more strongly about implementing a way to scout opponent's boards so at least I have something to spend that time on in-game.
---
Fuck yes!!!!!
---
Death to shamanstone!!!

There should be an in-game shop where you can buy packs with gold(100 gold each)

It worked, thanks.
---
So in arena today I went against a rogue who used hallucination twice early on.
---
He got the legendary weapon that gives 10 mana crystals, he instantly destroyed it on turn 7 by equipping it and using his hero power...then he played the 10 mana 7/7 that refreshes your mana crystals and then I lost the arena match. I feel your pain.
---
Half Reno half control half cube? thats 1.5 deck gotta be OPOP
---
Chinese money goes a long way.
---
Geist is hard coded to remove base 1 cost cards because Blizzard fucked up with Jade Idols and had to print a hard counter to it.
---
Mages eat dick
---
Dog and Hafu have been queuing together and scouting openly on stream. Its really easy right now. Maybe that changes coming out of beta, but I doubt it.
---
Yeah. Shut up.
---
Tough to call it an RNG fest when people like kripp get 1st place so many times in a row
---
So, stream sniping? Is that what you're saying?
---
I especially like that we get to wait for the person who is winning to rope out and emote for the full length of time before killing you each game.  That's the best part of not being able to concede at 1 hp vs a full board of minions.
---
No?  Because golden portraits start at 500?
---
Polymorph is one, and there are several other single card removal. Now shut the fuck up and go learn some basic human manners you god damn mongrel

I wanted to use the mold to make cholate ones. But sadly it wasn't food safe : (

---
That's the saddest thing to me. I play wild for the old cards being used in new ways and even back at a comfortable rank 15, there abound plenty of secret mages and sn1p-sn4pers
---
You just have to squelch your opponent to reroll a quest.
---
The last two expansions have been the best full expansions yet, in my opinion. Looking forward to April when all last year's stuff rotates.
---
You can just tell us how you get them? I watched 8 hours of twitch last night and nothing popped up. 
---
It's a difference between streams for us or eu. 
---
Its watching 10 streams at the same time a good strategy?
---
We have a change that prevents this back-and-forth matching coming in a future patch. It didn't make it in time for next week's patch, but it is coming!
---
breast plate?
---
Yeah, shame to the almost 800 others who upvoted this the last two hours!
---
Lmao I'm not laughing at you, but "You have too many upvotes" is perhaps the funniest thing I've read in a while.
---
Personally I really like this direction. The more Hearthstone shies away from the "give us 1000$ a year" model, the better chance it has, and all of the more advanced solo adventures, Arena and now Battlegrounds serve this purpose very well. You can play Battlegrounds without playing the ridiculously expensive card pack lottery, and that alone makes me want to launch HS to play them.
---
Curator exposed
---
&gt; you can play HS by yourself for free and even reach legend and compete at tournaments if you're good enough. 
---
We're talking about a game, not a full-time job. You know, something that you play for fun, not grind wins for 100 gold a day?
---
Sexy ice mage scissor sisters.
---
Cries in Valeera
---
There is something with rating. I know a streamer who gets only +28 rating for 1st place.
---
It's just a bug, will be fixed in the next patch.
---
Up until last month it wasn't a turn 4 thing and when the card came it was to counter especially druid and jades.
---
I think it’s a bug.
---
Not disabled, it’s a bug where the button literally doesn’t do anything
---
On mobile it’s worse, pressing the squelch button makes the entire app crash, probably same thing happening on pc too

---
He's clearly not going to be hunting for legend. The game will be fine for him without putting any money into it.
---
The theme/flavor is just excellent. Where’d you get all this art?
---
Actually should have played around this.
---
Most of it is found through Google, ArtStation, and official Blizzard / WoW TCG sources. Sourced as much as I could but a couple I was unable to find - I can try and look again for one if you like.
---
You should have been given a free arena ticket so you can finish this quickly for some quick gold
---
HAH! rAnK 25 nOoB mAgE!
---
Yeah I used the ticket and finished my run but the quest didn't complete. I was thinking maybe because it's not the dual-class Halloween one but just the normal one?
---
Hearthstone ....good?
---
Is your deck control or mogu combo?
---
Would have been better a screenshot of a decklist where every deck is incomplete. How does this happen, and with decks you just finished playing with.
---
Can you share some deck codes? I can't find a good mage or warrior deck that is appealing enough to play with :(
---
I need 500ish more wins to finish my 9 x 500.  Then I get to play the 5 classes I already closed out again.  I haven't touched mage in 2 years.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Now as you can see I am Rank 25 which is the highest rank there is so uh, yeah. Show some respect, kid.
---
if that means unerfing most if not all cards from past and not destroying cards with overtop nerfs and actully letting wild be place where can play old decks(unlike now due so many changes/nerfs those decks/combo's/whatever arent possible to do anymore)
---
then yes.
---
Sometimes you win because you get offered a really obvious path to victory, sure.  But if those are the only times you do well you won't end up at a very high rating.  The most satisfying games are the ones where you manage to pull a coherent strategy out of a pile of random nonsense and place well with it, and better players are much better at finding those strategies.
---
I love Battlegrounds and it’s given me a reason to look forward to logging into Hearthstone every day. I realize that the mode is in beta right now, but there’s a lot of funky things and balance issues.
---
The biggest balance issue IMHO is Mama Bear. First person to get Mama Bear absolutely steamrolls everyone in my experience. In this particular match I got Mama Bear on turn 3 from Shifter Zerus and proceeded to flatten everyone as I just focused on leveling for more Mama Bears. She shouldn’t be so damn powerful compared to other 6-drops.

---
The same was true for the 1st preview weekend of Legends of Runeterra which a lot of people took as a sign of the end of HS given it siphoned a lot of the regular streamers. Views are views and publicity is publicity, regardless of why there are views, and I think we can consider that a good thing.
---
Confirmation bias rears its head.
---
Its not entirely based on luck.  You still have to pick the minions.
---
This is stupid.
---
Loving the expansion as a whole. :)
---
Also, the ''Crank It!'' Warrior card is perfect, and so is its flavor text.
---
If the opponent's taunts have poisonous, you don't need to give goldrinn taunt.

It's not that streamers are at the top.  Look at the MMR of the top rated players, and how far they are from everyone else.  That gap means they are doing much better than average, and it isn't just down to how much they've played, without a good winrate playing more games doesn't help.
---
What?
---
yugioh cards that have the effect to instantly win the game when you have all parts.
---
Sounds good I guess I have to study game more because I get asked questions about game and I don't understand lingo.
---
They are probably rolling in the preorder money with battlegrounds. *insert wiping-tears-with-money.gif*
---
It's not banned, it's limited. Means you can only play 1 of each piece instead of 3. It's not a very good deck though.
---
yeah i'm not that heavy into HS to know every meta,strategy or exploit... since i found it out myself i thougt it was pretty cool ...
---
While murlocs are arguably the worst tribe they can still get you the #1 spot through the sheer strength of Coldlight Oracle and Poison. This is because poison means your minions actually have 999 attack and the only thing you care about is their health, which Coldlight provides in space.  
---
As for taunts, from what I've seen most people who finish #1 taunt up their entire board because Strongshell is just too good to pass up, leaving only key minions such as junkbot or hyena untaunted.
---

Deathwing: Dats my boi
---
It depends on the MMR of your opponents. Wouldn't surprise me if they prioritized quick games over smaller MMR bands.
---
No worries so do we all. If you have Qs feel free to ask.
---
Most everyone on this sub is pretty helpful
---
it even happened before the fatigue dmg (which was **29** at that point),   
---
so it probably was the turn limit (of 90 in total, 45 per player, as I just found out)
---
[https://imgur.com/a/puTho03](https://imgur.com/a/puTho03) &lt;- this is the last screenshot I took before that final turn
---
Thats the play i went with but it left me at 4 health with him having a 3dmg minion, plus his 2 dmg hero power
---
Thank you so much, I have been having tons of crashes, and I started to record my games on my mobile.
---
Just went back and sure enough as soon as you click their character portrait and the squelch pops up even if you don’t click, you crash.
---
What would people think about about getting some kind of board rotation mechanic in with the Carousel Gryphon as a hero? 
---
Keeping minions would be broken, so it's more of something you need to play around like Nepharian. Unsure of the correct HP cost of this kind of effect.
---
We have a thread and a list of scammers. People can only scam once before they are blacklisted from the thread and I know I check the list if that person doesn’t put their ID in the thread.
---
Thanks I'm just venting, spent 1 hr playing all losses. Lol it's just a game but the time is valuable lol
---
If I got it on the last draw sure, but if i had drawn it 2-3 turns earlier I would've been fine. Point is it's a nzoth deck and I didn't draw nzoth
---
Ah. Lag is never fun. I wish the devs would explain how the turn timer works because it's unclear and seems inconsistent.

---
LET IT ALL OUT
---
Psycho-tron has saved me quite a bit, it's 3/4 with divine shield which makes it around 6/5 (kind of all over the place with how I calculated these, but counted the divine shield as +attack &amp; +1 hp), which is 11 stats which is better than the 10 from 3/3 wolf that summons 2 1/1's however that wolf will see more late game play because it summons beasts which is good synergy with pack leader &amp; mama bear.
---
Khadgar is useless with a big board, I often see more value from him when I roll into him from a deathrattle, and Zerus can cost games with bad rolls, but is a decent risk if you're only offered junk. Yeah I rated soul juggler low because it requires your board to die with demon synergy, it's effect is also very poor late game, dealing 3 damage to 20/20's per your minion death isn't going to do much.
---
Buffing wolf is definitely not overrated, it's won me plenty of 1st places, the issue is it's useless to get late game, you want it before 3 people have been knocked out &amp; you have to really play into it, getting it with a Hydra, Security Rover, Amalgam, Mal'ganis or 3/1 demon that gains health for health lost = game won. Strongshell is good but requires taunts, which aren't many, and good ones at that, so it requires you to get Argus which isn't great itself. Mal'ganis is actually decent compared to the others, it's a 9/7 that can buff amalgam +2/+2 which makes it a 11/9 = 20 stats which is more than Highmane at 19. Discoverloc is cheap sure, but what happens when it offers you the 3/3 +2attack, 1/2 +1atk per summon &amp; 2/1 summon 1/1? waste of time and possibly gold, I mainly consider it when I'm looking for a triple amalgam or something. You've never seen Rivendare? how many games have you played lol I'm at 5.2 with 21 first places &amp; 72 top four, granted it's only ever seen paired with a Goldrinn but when it is +8/+8 to 5 minions is really good, especially when you golden one of the two.
---
Megasaur I have trouble seeing being decent, most people run with 1 Amalgam, if they get lucky 2, I don't see being able to give 1-2 minions one of divine shield/windfury/poisonous/+3 atk/+3health being worth the 6 star 5/4, if you're only left with crap options sure, but upgrading to T6 to try and get it doesn't seem like a thing.
---
But I added them to a priest deck
---
Dont have one but I checked out the specs, the storage is small but it will fit hearthstone just fine, it should run everything just fine except for battelgrounds until it gets optimized (hopefully monday or tuesday) not a bad bad choice overall but if you want to do more than hearthstone on there its gonna be a struggle for storage
---
No. You should pick a different game if thats your time available. This game requires a lot more time. Or a lot of money.
---
I understand, just want to share it. It is quite a ridiculous bug, seems to me
---
Yeah it's pretty misleading :P
---
Yup
---
Yup same error and my decks lost their cards again about ready to uninstall until they get out of beta mode and stop letting free interns work on their products
---
Ugh fuck that boss. Worst cancer next to Applebough and Haro
---
Yes, something you can definitely do fairly well in the mid game. But in the end game compositions are pretty tight.
---
I'm talking when you've got a board that looks something like: the 4/4 deathrattle wolf thing, hydra, double amalgam (probably with poison/taunt/divine shield), rat, hyena(?), mamma bear - or some variation of this. Of course all the minions are buffed too.
---
Whichever minion you steal will be huge in reducing their overall power - especially as it'll be replaced by something absolutely trash (I'd imagine that in late game you specifically buy things that don't have synergies with your opponents board to give them).
---
Wait, hold up. You said "Grow up and wait". That's not rude? Okay.
---
I wasn't complaining. I was making an observation for the sake of discussion. Did it seem like I was being emotive? I thought I was being fairly objective in my observation that A) there is a significant amount of discontent if you read Twitch chat and B) this discontent may hurt engagement in the long run. 
---
Also, you're clearly NOW being aggressively rude. I do not understand what makes you have this sort of mentality. You need to check yourself. Stop being a world class asshole.  Maybe YOU should "calm the F down."
---
Dude, I said the person played too many video games and got literally dozens of comments saying I’m an asshole.  This has nothing to do with projection ya dork.
---
You don't have a life partner
---
To be clear, it is frustrating somewhat to me. Otherwise I wouldn't state this observation. I do have some stake in it. I would like to play the mode. As I said, however, I am waiting and I don't intend to prepurchase for the sake of access.
---
I am re-reading my post and wondering where you went off the rails on my mental state. I think you're the problem here.
---
You could just search

Best hero portrait ever made, the best one is when the timer is running out and he says Hello! in a panic
---
Thanks for the update, I'll try to keep track of these variables myself!
---
already got my refunds.
---
Thanks
---
I played it for like a week, was totally not impressed. It was just like every other shooter in the world. I agree that there are very few orginal games out there and something is a copy of something else but it was like they made it and sat on it for 10 years and then released it.
---
I gotchoo
---
This is what I was thinking. It will still be a grind to get a good base set, but it is possible.
---
Earlier this year I started a bee free account to see what it was like starting now (as I was a beta player) 
---
One thing I should mention though is that its good to start when a new exp comes out, because there are normally extra quest for packs.
---
I know you probably said this to push my buttons, and it worked ya clever bastard...
---
Dude, I’ve been watching MMA since 2006, I remember because it was Anderson’s UFC debut.  I’ve been training BJJ since I was in elementary school over 10 years ago and training Muay Thai since 2013.  If ya wanna try insult me go ahead, but this isn’t the way to do it.

Highly intelligent old human detected.

NathanSmart#1966 NA Looking for someone to complete 80g quest

Means you were one of the highest ranked players in that lobby so you are expected to win which means less points.
---
Accept my friendship
---
Thanks!
---
I don't know though. Trained to fight evil forces, driven to evil by a mastermind (Kel'Thuzad - Sidious), tries to defeat his own disappointed master(Uther - Obi-Wan), turns to be the leader of said evil (Scourge - Empire/Sith)
---
You could say there are some parallels, other that just turning evil.
---
Hadn't thought of that. Maybe a delay in the stream, like on counter strike go? Do you think that would work?
---
Really incredible job with this set, great flavor and design!
---
Oh! I didn’t know they announced that kind of stuff already. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Imagine Reynad is still playing. Would be so fun
---
Thank u, yeah I did have that image as a reference here.  
---
I'm still on my way to practicing the Hearthstone Style.
---
Who are the others?
---
It's the combined level of all heroes of recruited friends, not their ranked ladder position.

If you see through the progress menu that your friend reached 20 and you didn't get a reward, probably reach out to blizzard.
---
The pose is quite similar, but with the exception of the tail being forwards that's just the regular whelpling pose.
---
0-3 incoming
---
I agree. I don't have a problem with aggro decks or even strong aggro decks, they're important for an honest and healthy meta. The problem I have is with explosive runes and, most of all, counterspell. Those secrets prevent you from interacting with the game at all, even as a heavy control deck.
---
I of course would like for anything, including basic cards, to be disenchantable. I am additionally of the opinion that games like Hearthstone should have a more “standard video game” pricing model, where $60 gets you the entire card set &amp; single player mode access for individual expansions. Removing the need to disenchant at all. I think anyone who disagrees with this notion is sorely misguided, and has been hoodwinked by incoherent &amp; misleading corporate arguments. 
---
That being said - I also understand how the real world works, and it’s of course never going to be the case that Hearthstone (or other comparable games) would ever be priced or modeled in such a way as my ideal. The best that can be reasonably hoped for is better conditions *within* the shitty conditions. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to say that being able to disenchant legendaries like C’thun or SN1P-SN4P would be a reasonable (and “likely”, if enough of a fuss was raised about it) change to the game.
---
Lately I've gotten a few legendaries on more than one run. And it usually ends at 6 to 7 wins. I tend to do better without. Here goes nothin
---
I would say that's amazing how many crybabies tears we always get every time that shaman becomes playable again instead
---
Okay Shaman player. Thanks for the life lesson

Has to contain Sylvanus
---
No, they need to hit lvl 20 on their account - the sum of levels of all classes. You can check their level on your recruit tab
---
I got Morgl a month ago this way
---
Rank doesn't have anything to do with it
---
I guess you not getting him may be the result of all the bugs, which appeared after last patch
---
Rats arnt good against Mechathun warlock because of cataclysm, even if your opponent happens to have one
---
&gt;It's amazing how much negative feedback they can get for a special event and still not give a fuck.
---
No surprise, just look at wild at how they treat the feedback for naga sea witch,barnes and now snip snap warlock , but don't worry the new expansion is going to launch soon, expect more communication and action from them during this 1-2 months.
---
Yo dawg I heard you like Hearthstone so I put Hearthstone in your Hearthstone so you can Hearthstone while you Hearthstone
---
Most people who care enough about winning to grind all the way to legend probably still care about winning when they get there I guess
---
I have the stupid play 12 dragons quest but I don’t have any. Also I can’t reroll so I’m kinda sad.
---
&gt; averaging between 10k-20k during non-HS events.
---
It's 7-10k for me whenever I watch Twitch (GMT +8).
---
I can elaborate later when I’m home.
---
how was rogue your last class to get to 1k wins? one of the most fun ones to play imo
---
You did not anonymize The Curator. He mad now.
---
I wanna know what a Jubjub bird would be in Hearthstone.
---
When I winstreak 5 ranks in a session it's pure skill
---
When I lose 3 in a row Blizzard are rigging games against me
---
Please do
---
Looks amazing!
---
Lmao sorry I didn't know it was a crime to respond with my reasoning.
---
Is there a way to know how many wins you’re at?
---
