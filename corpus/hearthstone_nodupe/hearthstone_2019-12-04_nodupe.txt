They will be removed. If you own the actual Wild versions, those will stay, but these versions will be removed from your collection altogether.

Bring them back, but only for two-three weeks. Then rotate them out and bring in others.
---
Kind of right. This is indeed the mechanic, sold minions go back into the pool, and tokens don't get offered. But this is a pseudo common glitch that happens from time to time. I don't know what causes it but I have been offered the murloc 1-1 as an option.

Perfection.
---
Didn't know you get to keep playing after you die against this boss. The 2 times I've played it my deck was so OP
---
[Yes.](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23190444/draconic-details-getting-to-know-galakrond)
---
&gt;Once Galakrond is played and his Battlecry has been unleashed, he can no longer be upgraded through Invoke cards, though they will still trigger the Invoke effect.
---
Honestly I didn't know Rexxar had the ability when I first made the post - it honestly took me by surprise when Trump brought it up in his latest review. But between that and Brann (the Hunter representative in SoU and DoD) being a dwarf and dwarves being gryphon riders, it just seems like too loose a lore connection for me. 
---
All things considered though I am getting warmer to the idea of Stormhammer being a Hunter weapon... I can't reconcile its synergy with dragons though, haha.
---
Thanks
---
Would you believe that I actually made an attempt at designing a deck to work with that card. It was so bad that all I could do was laugh. I tried it a few times actually, I was beaten so badly that even my opponents couldn't believe it.
---
It will still trigger his hero power, but it won't use up your hero power for the turn
---
Oh, that's no accident I'm sure. The last set before rotation is when you break everything and make people spend their dust to have a somewhat competitive deck, before wiping it all away.
---
... that seems incredibly stupid. 
---
You're suggesting that people pay money to not play a free to play game.
---
Nobody is really that stupid, yeah?
---
Ysera is going to be the first card I test in the new expansion. Once Evolve rotates, Quest Druid should have some freedom to play some really greedy cards. Frizz Kindleroost in a ramp deck could be quite powerful.
---
I don't like Sir-Annoy-O and the Super Creepy Tree. They should've been Yrel, and Hamul. The marketing department of the company probably saving these heroes for 80$ bundles to milk more money.
---
They are pack leaders, you racist.
---
As a Priest player I can confirm, we have to file taxes 3 times per year. In fact, I think it's almost time to file again üò¨
---
&gt; We do not allow meme pictures, screenshots of rage conversations, or game screenshots that don't show actual gameplay interaction.
---
Yeah right...
---
the quest reward is just too valueable for that, imo. Even waiting one turn more is a huge difference, so maybe the other druid cards will be good enough for an alternative, but goru its not.
---
I personally thought about that Goru could have been a choose one card in the earlier design staes - something like your treants get +1/+1 or summon 2 treants" for one immediate effect, but maybe it was too strong with how quest druid performs right now.
---
The best cards shown so far either:
---
1. come with at least one asterix 
---
   1. Breath Cycle
---
   2. Galakronds
---
   3. Sidequests
---
2. are more flash than they are substance
---
   1. Ysera Unleashed
---
   2. Plate Breaker
---
   3. Valdris Felgorge
---
   4. Kobold Stickyfinger
---
3. or "powercreep" cards that are no longer in Standard nor saw much play in the first place (at least in the class in question)
---
   1. Dragoncaster
---
   2. Amber Watcher
---
The only cards that are definitely very strong perhaps to the point of format warping include:
---
1. Dragonqueen Alexstrazsa
---
   1. Zephrys has show the Highlander condition really isn't that steep for some decks
---
   2. She'll see play in any deck already playing him
---
2. Crazed Netherwing
---
   1. Basically Warlock's Duskbreaker
---
      1. Duskbreaker by itself was enough to get Priest to play the two other decent dragons in Standard during the Year of the Raven
---
3. Cumulo-Maximus
---
   1. Granted, I'm unsure if it'll see play in Quest Shaman, that deck just doesn't play enough enablers, but it will definitely bolster Aggro Shaman
---
Everything else I'd at least wait on claiming it's broken.
---
I'm sorry but I have to correct you on one point. The others Blizzcon skins (bastion and Winston) are exclusive. It has always been said about the demon Hunter Sombra that it could be obtained later. Take a look at the recap of the virtual goodies of last year Blizzcon, you will see.
---
It ends, like you've lost 3 times but you get a free arena ticket.
---
Considering lightfang its getting nerfed, its more likely iron sensei is balanced and lightfang is to strong
---
Yeah the dragon synergy doesn't make much sense to me either. I feel like they just went "Eh we need it to fit the Dragon theme somehow"
---
In the Founding of Durotar Campaign Rexxar gets [Storm Bolt instead of summon eagle.](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PV60aBXhvBo/V5KDz5S772I/AAAAAAAALJM/D_2YzbC4rlcn4HWsrt06zTmubn9HLkmVgCLcB/s1600/warcraft3.rexxar.jpg)
---
This is to keep you form having a map hack bird in a structured campaign. And whenever Blizz didn't know what to give a hero in WC3 they usually gave them Storm Bolt or something similar.
---
No, it couldn't be some epic tauren... it had to be this creep... 
---
and again for druid... like wtf... is this because you nerfed them to the ground
---
What is an albatross deck?
---
tauren at all! But noooooooo.... we give you creepy treant

---
Not only is this 0 mana,  it has a small drawback. While surrender to madness literally causes you to lose the game because you have no mana for anything.
---
Well, how would you go about it then? Who cares what Team 5's coders managed to come up with at this moment. 
---
How would you solve the "issue" and why is making a genie who says "Your wish is my suggestion" on summon perfect even in flavor?
---
Congrats on legend!!
---
Am i the only one whos having kaleseth flashbacks only this time.... turn 1.. yiekes
---
Priest, Rogue, Warlock, and Warrior have each gotten an epic that has a battlecry that triggers if you've invoked twice.  Stands to reason the remaining shaman epic follows the pattern.
---
Didn't work in German :(
---
The Simpsons word is "vergranden" but the new Hearthstone card is "Riesenwuchs" which is literally "Giantgrowth"
---
no one cares
---
It will probably not work well then in decks that aren't specifically build for this card.
---
If it did happen, though, you‚Äôd probably be swimming in dust when they put out a patch to recompensate you for it.
---
I would just love to be able to use my collection for a build your own starter deck in dungeon runs. It could even be an unlock for beating the mode so it doesnt just make it super easy.
---
Yeah surprised so many people didn't seem to get that lmao, that literally was what I was saying. 1 Mana for +1/+2 and 3 armor is nutty
---
Thanks Ruggsii üòâ
---
https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23239988/welcoming-the-return-of-winter-veil
---
Copying my post from the other thread, but platebearer is a terrible card that is unlikely to see any kind of play outside of  "discover" effect. Just because some decks can occasionally pull high number of armor doesn't mean you want to run it.  It could change in the future if they decided to introduce new common cards that add silly number of armor, but it's not going to affect the current meta. You don't tech against that one fringe deck, especially not with a card that is unplayable against everything else.
---
Realistically, including this cards in almost any decks is going to give you a lower win rate, because drawing a 5mana 5/5 that do nothing is bad. And that one game out of 50 where you encounter an armor druid, a dead man draw Warrior, or something that has a meaningful amount of armor won't make an impact on your win rate. And even then, it's not insta win.
---
Inner Fire Priest, Control Warrior in Wild are probably the only one deck who could include this tech card. Those two decks already have lot of redundancy, but I still doubt it will see play.
---
Twice

Occurring often, should‚Äôve specified. I can get in like 1 in five attempts.

I kinda like selfless - obviously trash in round 1, but he's one of the few that actually has relevance beyond the first couple turns.  Still far from my favourite but especially for heroes that usually buy a minion on turn 2 (such as bartendotron) I think it can have a pretty big impact for a first turn pickup.
---
What‚Äôs cubelock? New to the sub
---
I like how there‚Äôs two Alamgams in Murloc - and they even have their own section. That‚Äôs some Amalgam respect!
---
Fair enough, I posted this out of anger 
---
Good news is I won like a couple tries later using only Brann and Elise.
---
You get to switch heroes
---
this doesn't make any sense though, if I sold tons of tokens, you'd think they would appear more commonly, but they don't. Surely a bug as it makes no sense for it to be there.
---
In general they don't/shouldn't.
---
ITs A TAveRn DoOr 5HEaD
---
embiggen? it's a perfectly cromulent card title.
---
[removed]
---
But ‚ÄúAnka, the Buried‚Äù seems more like an epithet too but it does have a comma.  What group does he belong to that calling him ‚Äúthe Buried‚Äù specifically identifies him?
---
Same with most of the others in the comma group other than the Loa.
---
I wouldn't know. I don't even know how to change my hero, or my card back. I really don't understand the fascination with them, frankly.
---
Odd how A F Kay gets tier a even though it skips the first 2 turns where you'd ideally be looking pogos.
---
Love it! I'll admit that I haven't been brave, or adventurous, enough to try them, but I'll definitely give it a go on an alternate region soon.
---
What are your thoughts on some people tiering up to 4 (for the extra tavern slot)?
---
&gt;randomly generated
---
Luckily it's doesn't have a tribe, there are very few effects that randomly generate non-specific neutral minions.
---
 Choco#1508 Trading 80g quest on NA. I show, you go first.
---
As far as "replace x with random cards" effects go this is one of the stronger ones?
---
Keep a run on 2 losses.  I believe when patch drops your reward will include a dragons pack and a free arena ticket.
---
Just make a bunch of Ancients and give them the Treant tribal tag. I wish they'd do that anyway in normal Hearthstone. Theres plenty of "treefolk" cards that arent Treants but easily could be :) Damn it Blizz.
---
So, its like if Khartut Defender was buffed by Embiggen, now costing 7 mana. It will not get drawn by Melon, right? Cos its base cost is 6 mana.
---
Correct
---
Yes, though still a terrible way to randomly lose
---
I have an issue on iPhone 6s Plus where I can‚Äôt change tavern or buy minions with focus on cards in my hand.
---
That's probably a bug
---
this is pretty meh.
---
Played a lot of Treant for fun and one thing i super wanted for the deck was a 1 mana Treant. This 1 mana spell is perfect and on top if that its also got added flex with the +2hp/taunt buff for mid/late game. Love it. The legendary is a bit slow for a deck thats basically token druid with Treant tag. Buuut its a 1x so ill run it anyway for flavor probably, it might even end up being good anyway as the full Treant deck often goes to mid game. If you play a proper token deck with just a few Treant cards then the legendary is meh. The 1 mana spell is still super dope though.
---
When has the existence of a tech card ever outright killed a deck either in Standard or Wild?
---
Gollaka Crawler didn't kill Pirate Warrior during Un'Goro format.
---
Skulking Giest didn't kill Jade Druid.
---
Bomb Warrior, Beneath the Grounds, and other shuffle cards into your opponent's deck cards didn't kill Highlander.
---
Chief Inspector, Eater of Secrets, and so on didn't and aren't stopping Secret decks from being good.
---
Ooze effects didn't do crap against Cube Warlock's dominance.
---
As such, if you want to play your super slow Armor Druid in Wild, the fact a tech option exists isn't going to affect you winrate.
---
I'm dying hahahahha
---
Hot Air Balloon is underrated.  This is better than a vanilla 1/3 for 3 with a tribe.
---
One of the more impactful cards will be Transmogrifer.   
---
That‚Äôs the 3/2 for 2 that changes your drawn cards to random legendaries.   I can‚Äôt wait to see it pop up from a lackey and ruin some combo player‚Äôs day.
---
Alright. Got it. Thank you for the clarification!
---
I thought this was fake lol
---
ah, a pogo enthusiast. true man of culture.
---
No play style should go without counter.
---
Even then, a single Tech option with such a narrow range of applications rarely if ever stops a deck from being good enough to reach tier one.
---
Seal Fate says otherwise. There‚Äôs no reason for that card to not be two mana. As long as Prep is in Standard Rogue as a class will suffer.
---
I think the only random way to add this card to your hand (in standard) is Astral Rift, Blazing invocation, and Elysiana? So hopefully it won't happen too often
---
Comma the, Inconsistent
---
For Solia, sure, but who in their right mind WOULDN'T run Zephrys, Reno, Brann, etc. in their commander deck?
---
That deck does not see even remotely enough play for running this card to be worth it. Even if it was seeing play, aggro already beats it just fine. And none of the best decks actually use armor right now, so it likely won't be run at all.
---
I still hate the card because of how polarizing it is, but I expect to see very little of it in Wild.

Actual good combo in a sea giant deck
---
Sign of a good player. Morons like myself would be baited into rerolling til I have 4 hp left.
---
I assumed it is based on health: -5 is better than -20.
---
Isn‚Äôt it health at the end of the round? You lose by -2 and your opponent loses at -5. You‚Äôd be ranked higher.
---
 I believe.
---
It‚Äôs a perfectly cromulent word

Triple is 2 random cards. 
---
We don't have spells. Other than Hero abilities. And 1/3/8 damage isn't a silence/transform. I don't think we should get targeted spells. That's not Battlegrounds. But we need a way to shut down, randomly, a shielded, taunt, poison, deathrattle. And we can't right now.
---
No minion type. If they got nothing to silence, it does nothing. So it's a risk. What do you think?
---
Works well in quest druid too.

---
Way too long.... should have been a week
---
It's dumb. Silence would be disgustingly broken.
---
That would be so cancerous. It would just ruin a person‚Äôs gameplan with no counter play.
---
I agree and I‚Äôm fairly confident that it will become a sleeper card like Keleseth.
---
Nearly every expansion Druid has been able to put some kind of token-based deck together due to AoE buffs and Savage Roar. This makes their tokens much stickier. 
---
A 3/3 divine shield for 2? 
---
A 3/5 Beast for 2 in Wild?
---
BockClocked#2822 (EU) and #1965 (NA)
---
EU and NA trade only
---
Don't mind who goes first, message on here and add on HS.
---
I'm not going to give this card more consideration because predicting cards is a crap shoot at best. The all-powerful, meta-defining Keleseth was actually dismissed when it was announced. 
---
Just to be clear, the OP here has a long history of angsty, wordy posts that essential boil down to "Card bad = devs bad." It's okay to say something along the lines of "this card looks a lot like a card I didn't like playing against and that makes me nervous." It's another thing to come at it like you're a design expert and this card shouldn't even made it past the drawing board.
---
Team 5 actually plays and tests these cards quite a bit before they make it into the game. And while they certainly miss sometimes and sometimes miss bad. This kind of condescending post is completely unfair to them.
---
As I said, a solid mid-range Druid deck might be perfectly fine in the upcoming meta. It might actually be a really fun play. **We don't know because we haven't played it yet.** Anything happening is speculation.
---
Its nice of him to at least include commas.
---
Haven‚Äôt seen anything, but they would tell us during the final reveal stream.
---
ok thanks
---
Eh.
---
There's that one upgrade you can buy in Bob's Tavern that is "Give a minion +4/+4. It costs (2) more." This is exactly half of that effect, and it casts on every single minion in your deck. This card is honestly so crazy, like, you don't even lose any tempo playing this card.
---
That's how blizz makes support on teamtrees. Or at least it kinda looks like it

We will get Tyrande alright, but I still don't trust she'll be free before I see it. With how the Activision is bleeding through (just see how everything is paid limited time promotions instead of nice gifts or promotions, like we got sometimes back in the day) I don't trust that they won't claim she's technically free, but that you need to join something to get her that either might not be, or is a well known data colector.
---
Hope I'm wrong, but at this point, I'm a little sceptical on how this is going to turn out.
---
But a lot of people don't want or need said packs. At the very least they should offer some new hero skins outside of these packs. Having them only with these offers is stupid.
---
Honestly hoping that the remaining Shaman cards blow so that maybe I don't have to face one for a bit.
---
Me too. I know a lot of people dislike bronze explorer's art, but I personally find it very cute and I really like it. AYAYA.

Rexxar is half-orc, half-ogre.
---
But only control.
---
This card enables that generation
---
It was indeed a dark time for 2-drops. For most decks there was simply nothing better, so pretty much everyone ran Keleseth as the only 2-cost card. The only exceptions I can remember were if you had Wild Growth, Defile or Crackling Razormaw, or if you were running an Even deck.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt have been so bad if it weren‚Äôt so annoyingly common. When you immediately start out half your games at a disadvantage it really wears on you.

---
Thanks Blizzard. This expansion is powerful enough to define the meta but it also gets a tech card to stop it from running wild. Thank you Blizzard.
---
Destroys enemies armor only.
---
Holy fours Batman! On a more serious note, this goes in aggro maybe, and not sure what else. You'd hate to play a 4/4, and there are just better cards that do more. Obviously, this gets miles better if dragons are everywhere, but right now, I don't think every class is going to be running enough dragons for you to consistently get an on-curve 4 mana 8/8. Essentially a dead card against aggro decks who aren't running lots of dragons, and I'm thinking that's most aggro decks rn. Good sideboard material tho. 
---
TL;DR : Really good, but more situational than you might think.
---
No.
---
Broken
---
No it wouldn't
---
Auto-include in... everything?
---
One time I accidentally sold my amalgam, then 2 3 turns later saw someone adopted and feeding(with buffs) her with care. Long story short I lost that game.

I don't think Druid would be that great. The best Albatross classes are probably hunter, priest and Rogue. 
---
Hunter has [[Nine Lives]] and [[Necromechanic]]. With 7 mana you can shuffle 4 Albatross in the enemie's deck, either with the combo mentioned above or with Nine Lives + [[Augmented Elekk]].

---
Auto-include in every damn deck.
---
I'm not telling.
---
Where were this card and Platebreaker when Genn/Baku/DKs were relevant??
---
One and done.
---
To err is human.
---
Good tech card, but not a such a big problem to prevent dragon decks from being played.
---
That being said, I think dragon decks will put one of this into their deck also.
---
Yes, I did it for the golden cards.
---
Didn't say I didn't read it bro. Said I said my piece above this. Go ahead and check it. And then maybe cool off a bit you're coming in kinda hot about a children's card game.
---
Holy jizz, I did not expect this
---
This argument is used to defend a team that releases evolve into a meta with desert hares and mogu fleshshaper.
---
Yes, in principle, if everyone is super, no-one will be. But that requires the ability to balance everyone equally - so everyone actually is super. That is never going to happen. So you end up with some being super, some being subpar, and a single class representing 38% of the meta.
---
It's just a trite, easy-to-make statement that in practical terms is just plainly wrong.
---
It does have restrictions, in a sense. The effect will activate unconditionally, but in order to use it well, your deck needs to be built around it by having low cost minions and ways to refill your hand since you'll be dumping your hand on the board in the first few turns.
---
I smell a fake.
---
yes but also not other (probably more useful) epics
---
Bug.
---
This is honestly just dumb. Was really looking forward to making dragon decks for every class but this is such a low-risk high-reward card that I'm afraid I'll constantly be running into it.

Sad thing is that it's probably not even a bot.  Bots are much smarter than this.

6/6 drake &gt; random 3 drop
---
They already said she will be free.
---
He doesnt seem to run junkbot in his dream mech build..
---
28+2
---
But what if you are a dragon? Does this work on Galakrond?
---
Seem to be dream builds. The 7 cards he want in end game
---
"controls" implies that it's about minions I think
---
Aside from pure Galakrond decks (have a few in mind), pretty much. Not much downside from just playing it as a 4 as well. In fact this will probably see a lot of play from the Galakrond EVIL classes since the explorer decks are much more likely to run dragons.
---
Slow Galakrond decks will run this as well.
---
Ok, I was fine with Platebreaker, but this is some stupidly powerful tech, if I ever saw one. I'm just hoping decks will just not have the room for a 4 Mana 4/4, but given the upside... I struggle to see this not being run.
---
true that but normally late game with many deathrattles and on death buffs like scavenging hyena make fights take so much time and not mentioning poisons animation here(cause will get fixed soon). putting that aside I fought people and during our battle before it ends by 10\~15s i saw them upgrading and combine cards. I stopped playing when i reached 5200+ rating cause i noticed at most of my loses this happens alot to me and feels unfair.
---
But if you made this in custom hearthstone, you'd get laughed out of the subreddit...
---
Because most dragons are 8/8s or smaller, and since this is meant to be an antidragon tech, it wouldn't make much sense flavor wise for it to be a 7/7.
---
But who knows, maybe it'll end up being too good and they'll nerf it to a 7/7
---
OP in Arena
---
i really never use that word but you're pure cringe bruh
---
Hopefully
---
That means blissard follower free honk kong dong and shit like that
---
Or 10 mana 14/10 with Leroy
---
yeah class epics are broken, legendaries are broken, neutral epics are "meh". so if you wanna obtain those sweet broken cards, you must buy even more packs.
---
The Priest dragon for sure. Please be amazing!
---
To win the game
---
This guy gets it.
---
Primordial Explorer
---
Bronze Explorer
---
Scion of Ruin
---
Nozdormu the Timeless
---
Fate Weaver
---
Azure Explorer
---
All of which, except maybe Nozdormu, are high power level cards that will see play in dragon decks. This is only if you consider an 8/8 rush is overbearing on turn 4 specifically. This is efficient removal that will leave a body(likely an 8/4 or or better) at almost any stage of the game. Only Alexstrasza, Nozdormu, and the Primordial Explorer trade evenly with it, and the only dragon that straight up wins is Deathwing. I honestly think if this only gained +4 attack and not +4/+4, it would still see play.
---
Blizzard, please stop smoking crack while browsing r/customhearthstone. Seriously, this is beyond broken at this point. I was looking forward to a more midrange expansion... And then this monstrosity was revealed. Just scrap it; noone will miss it this early.
---
[Reno Relicologist]
---
[Spreading Madness]
---
This card is very good and will be seeing play in Wild Warlock decks. I look forward to adding this to my Renolock.
---
I admittedly missed that one... although obviously, if your opponent has played the new Paladin legendary, you can play much worse than an 8/8 with Rush.
---
It reminds me of [[Temporus]] in many ways - if your opponent can't put a lot of pressure on the board after you play it, you can put a lot of pressure on the board.
---
I guess that we don't get any refund on him, do we?

7/6/6 Dragon | Battlecry: Your opponent takes two turns. Then you take two turns.  
---
From the grapevine, I hear he's taking this set off to work on more long term stuff with Blizzard.
---
(I didn't get the ping btw for some reason).
---
Even if it doesn't come out ON turn 4, it's still an 8/8 with rush for only 4 mana, which is still broken even in the late game.
---
This is a neutral, conditional [[Militia Commander]]. The battlecry is overstatted, should be +2/+2 this turn.
---
Yes, we have moved a long way. Have you seen the power level of this set? The dragon decks especially look ridiculous. This has to be good to be effective.
---
Best case scenario is 11 hits, there's a new warlock legendary that increases hand size.
---
I bet he could get to casual
---
The only reason [[Dragonslayer]] didn't get much limelight is because there were barely any dragons. *This* shit? This shit is in an expansion *all about dragons*. This ain't fine.

---
4/2/5 | Rush Battlecry: Gain +3 Attack this turn.  
---
Best case would actually be 11 damage for 3 Mana
---
I think you need at least 6 other cards in hand for this to be good? If it would be able to hit face, this could be a potent finisher after the board clear.
---

---
3/4/3 | Battlecry: Deal 6 damage to a Dragon.  
---
Looking at this as an on curve play you get 6 damage going first and 7 going second. This is assuming you pass T1 and tap T2. That seems... ok? The problem is "ok" cards are usually not good enough to be played in HS. It'll probably be meta dependent.
---
Well jaraxuss is different as he is a minion with a battle cry as opposed to all the regular hero cards
---
This one deserve a golden copy
---
Oh. Yeah I can't read apparently.
---
Does Shudderwock get the buff even when there is no dragon on the battlefield?
---
Best case would actually be 12 damage
---
Do u played in classic ? Deathknight was played to destroy ancient of war vs druid. 
---
It was a 1 or 2 off in every single deck back into classic. 
---
Then, yes. Im not saying this card is good. But it has definitely potential.
---
1/2/2 never was bad. Even 1/1/3 is good. An aggro deck NEEDS a turn 1 play. If its not a 1/1/3, it will be a 1/2/2, because those are the best stats to have for a turn 1 card.
---
&gt; This shit is in an expansion all about dragons. 
---
Yeah, I think that's the point.
---
you probably want to play this early tho. So often times you will be dumping it way before then imo.And if you can survive till you can get the 11 damage you're probably in a winning position already.
---
This will see play in *every* deck so long as you can smell a whiff of dragon in the meta. The risk is waaaay too low for the payoff of an 8/8 rush on *turn 4*. Half the dragons Blizz printed are now bin material because they give your opponent an 8/8 rush. It won't keep dragon decks "honest"; it'll keep them dead.
---
I think this is decently balanced. On Turn 3 you most likely have 7 cards (9 going second) and it will be hard for Aggro players to put out more than 7 health on the board after their second turn.
---
Spell Damage on this could be pretty insane.
---
Also, Gurubashi Berserker value? :D
---
No
---
Or here me out on this. High skill decks, with lots of options, flexible cards, and ways to branch out that allow you to still seek win-conditions even in losing match-ups; along with more windows of interaction and allowing a skilled player to conserve resources and punish a less skilled player for being reckless; so that everything isn't decided by what deck you play. 
---
RPS meta is never the goal. It's equally boring, except it's not as immediately obvious to a casual player as seeing Shamen every other game.
---
So the point is to make about 90% of the dragons they literally just created completely unplayable garbage? That sounds like shit design if I've ever heard of it.
---
*Laughs in only 1st place Jaraxxus picks*
---
Fo' real though people are really sleeping on Jaraxxus
---
Let's you deal with token/wide boards earlier than volcano. But it's unlikely token druid and shaman will make a return.
---
It shouldn't.
---
And nightmare amalgam, and basically all the "explorer" dragons, and twilight Drake, and every other midrange/tempo dragon.
---
I like the way you did it, but I would be interested in seeing the alternative if it's already made!
---
Auto include in non-dragon decks
---
Dragons don't bite. Dragons scrape and lick.
---
There's powerful dragons, sure... But this isn't just powerful. This is literally gamebreaking if midrange dragons so much as show their face in Hearthstone, ever.
---
There‚Äôs a number on the card, it‚Äôll definitely increase from spell damage
---
You can't, it's against the t&amp;c.
---
for minions no, for hero cards yes, like tess, im assuming
---
For some reason I thought Leeroy cost 6 mana. Adding up is difficult.
---
wtf is the upper half of the art ? is he dabbing ? or what Is that supposed to be
---
There is a difference between when a tech card is a tempo swing and outright wins the game for you. I fundamentally dislike cards like this, and skulking geist because they are too game warping.
---
Such a cool card
---
It‚Äôs to substitute 477
---
The art is amazing
---
Also Elise would never go by just "The Enlightened".@
---
Is that a.... flying shark..? In the background?
---
Well with the health buff unless it takes more than 4 damage it'll be a 4/4 when the buff wears off.
---
This card is really strong, but with how insane some of these dragon cards are, you kind of need to counter a strong late game with strong early game. I think this should mean both dragon decks and those running this counter would have a chance.
---
But Bonemare WAS strong though 7 mana for a total of 9/9 stats it broke arena and saw constructed play
---
UntermRad#1363
---
NA
---
I show you, you go first!
---
Just play a minion with a battlecry summon before you play this card and you will be able to play Shudderwock every turn.
---
Its ok
---
That's one way to look at it. Another is to see the potential of handbuff cards available in other classes which makes this way better than a 10/10 rush 
---
Specifically, I see this in Akali/Galakrond warrior as it adds another crazy buff target aside from Scion of Ruin. With Akali, its 20/18, with Galakrond its 18/16. Granted Scion of Ruin will still be better but this isn't a bad alternative at all.
---
But if you just say "bware da Soulflaya'" everyone knows who you mean.
---
Deathrattle: Put this weapon into your hand
---
hero power: Destroy a minion
---
I‚Äôve seen charging patches for leagues, watched as druids and shamans summoned legions of bigger men, quaked at the autopilot big priests, but nothing fills my heart with colder dread than this upcoming expansion. Repent, ye sinners, REPENT.
---
She could be the missing Shaman Legendary? Freeze Shaman???
---
The way it is will trade with the 8/8 dragons (on your turn) and the 4/12 dragons (on their turn)
---
Cards like this dont count themselves, so with t2 tap t3 this you deal 6 damage on the play or 8 on the draw.
---
# YOU ARE NOT PREPARED

üêô Against the dragons I get slimy üêô with several minions you'll want to try me üêô you got a plan I'm it's disruptor üêô that's right boys it's Faceless Corruptor. üêô
---
Everyone is going to run this alongside big game hunter. Kinda similar to the dr boom days where a card was so op, the best counter to that card was also considered op.
---
These "Faceless" tentacle guys popping up in the set tells me that the adventure is going to end with some Old Gods shenanigans...
---
That's because this is not an interesting, well designed card to counter an archetype. It's cheap, uninteresting and straightforward. Unlike many cool cards coming in this set.
---
LI-LIK-LI-LIKE SWATTING INSECTS!
---
I dont have a problem with this comment, but that username tho.
---
5 mana 5/5 ‚ÄúBreak armor‚Äù would certainly raise some eyebrows if it were proposed as a custom card for DoD, but it wouldn‚Äôt be viewed as the craziest card in the set by half.
---
A.F.Kay actually stillsTarts at tier 1; you just start with enough gold to tier up. This actually means your window of opportunity starts turn later than most heroes, and not necessarily shorter.
---
No. Because Elise never just goes by "The Trailblazer" or "The Enlightened". Comma is for when what's after the comma could be considered valid when standing alone.
---
Nice
---
Costs 3, possible 9 damage base, 11 damage with new legendary. Lots of handlock this meta, might be viable.
---
Flamewreathed Faceless is a Shaman card and it has Overload: (2)
---
This shit is neutral, has +1/+1 compared to Flamewreathed, it has Rush AND it is neutral.
---
If you can't activate the battlecry it's still a 4 4/4 which is not bad.
---
You really don‚Äôt want to tier up, as it dilutes the minion pool pretty severely. Once you‚Äôre comfortable with how many pogos you have, it‚Äôs not a bad idea, however.
---
Uhm, deathrattle? I don‚Äôt know. But they‚Äôre pain in the ass. I hate them.
---
idk if I even will play this expansion, such stupids card, cant play control dragon priest, cant play CW. I probably should wait what the meta is in the streamers event, but right now my hype level is at the bottom.
---
Better than two months of Evolve and Nzoth!
---
with which card in combination? warrior galakrond?
---
Druid, nerfed?
---
&gt; understated three drop with an unreliable draw type effect
---
It had discover plus on a vanilla 2 drop for 3. It was hyper popular in some regions in control warrior. How many cards have increased the cost of every minion in your deck by one? I don't know of any cards with that drawback. If you stack your deck with card draw, where are the minions? How does this mess with your curve? What about all the treant token cards you have to cut since they're not minions? You could play it in a minion based control deck &amp; guarantee the value, but does it make the cut there? It's a powerful card that doesn't seem like it fits a currently existing archetype. So it needs to create and support an archtype. I suspect treant druid will be stronger than embiggen.
---
You may not even get the full set of DoD
---
This is so useless in many situations. Your opponent just wait until the turn they have spare mana and cancel out this effect.
---
No one play this weak tech card in constructed.
---
Tess does play hero cards, but their battlecry still doesn't activate
---
Why not?  Battlecries happen when you play a card i thought
---
I think Singleton quest shaman would like this.
---
Assumed it would replay Tess itself (her Battlecry), but I guess not then. In which case, meh.
---
Suppose we'll see some Pyroblast shenanigans on Trolden with this though.
---
He's referencing Drawgonmaw Poacher, a four mana 4/4 that becomes an 8/8 with Rush if your opponent controls a dragon.
---
thats what i meant, its just gonna be a 8 mana 14/14.

Total darkness will be my revenge.
---
Based on stuff like Tess it would make sense for the card to just spawn the minions on board, so their battlecries won't trigger. Don't know how it works with hero cards though
---
Don't forget Sjow!
---
Most OTKs don't have time to do 2500 damage. Armor druid is busted in HS.
---
So your saying this is the weakest set ever released? Since most cards are unplayable
---
Wild growth, Nourish, Innervate... it was a year ago...
---
I almost guarantee top 4 with him, and usually get number 2 or 3 with this strat. 
---
Essentially, you only want to level up after you dance, and you want to prioritize dancing in divine shield minions. Spending gold on minions is almost always better than spending gold to level or re-roll. Only level past 3 stars when you have a board of 5+ danced minions. Don‚Äôt be afraid to hold 3+ cards in your hand, you‚Äôre usually way ahead of people, and can afford getting high stat divine shield minions for late game. 
---
Always prioritize mechs, as magnetic is completely broken for deryl, and this is the main mechanic you want to abuse. 
---
The only time I didn‚Äôt place 4th was because I was being incredibly greedy. I thought I was far enough ahead, and was holding 7 cards in my hand. I took a lot of damage early from incredibly bad luck, and the turn before I was fitting in a late game divine shield minion, I got hit with a 20 and died. I still got 5th place though. Would have easily been top 2 if I wasn‚Äôt greedy.
---
This is about 5k left over from last expansion and Battlegrounds motivating me to play more. A top four counts as a win as far as I‚Äôm concerned.
---
&gt; having a 4m 4/4 with no text is really going to hurt your match up against any non-dragon aggro deck for example.
---
not really considering the huge boost you get every other match.
---
Winds! Obey my command!
---
Yes, it is always random. You just have to play multiple copies of any bounce card. This increases your odds, but it is ofc never guaranteed.
---
Animation will probably skip opponents turn with 12 cards on hand
---
That's....not how it works
---
I have a 6gb ram phone and it's not unplayable.
---
200 packs? No way!
---
Reveal video showed targets are random and that it doesn't replay battlecries of your opponents minions, just summons them.
---
Why wouldn't it. Psychmellon is still standard.
---
There goes my idea of an Evasive Drakonid + Splitting Image control deck.
---
It won't be a sleeper since it's already garnering attention.
---
Just play Nefarian 4Head
---
Fucking power creep
---
I like the fact that its been a dragon factory this expac, and in the SAME expac they are printing cards that have counters. We don't see that much.
---
As a player who has reached legend a bunch I agree with what they said, this is definitely more impressive than legend.
---
But you would need a Spell Damage minion on the board, so you potentially waist damage on that instead of your opponent's minion and if it gets killed, you deal 1 damage per card again, so not that great of a combo.
---
Maybe not counters but some counter play *
---
Then you are not understanding what a ‚Äúdeck restriction‚Äù is.  Any card in Hearthstone encourages you to carefully craft your deck to maximize the effects of each of the cards in your deck (i.e. ‚Äúsynergies‚Äù). But only certain cards have deck restrictions. Keleseth has a deck restriction.  It‚Äôs battlecry literally says ‚ÄúIf your deck...‚Äù  Embiggen does not have a deck restriction.
---
I feel like u/envstat may be onto something with regard to the solo adventure. [When we see Sindragosa](https://youtu.be/8GHv3I9aDM8?t=72) in the trailer, she appears to be chasing **both** Rafaam and Reno. Furthermore, if we consider the fact that Sindragosa is featured despite having been defeated in a previous adventure, it means the Lich King could also revisit us. Would be an interesting choice, especially since the Lich King did also attempted to revive Galakrond at one point.
---
that's so coool
---
But will the invoke buffs remain if an invoked Galakrond was played?
---
It really should have been Rokhan
---
It's a bit of RNG true, but if there are a lot of enemy minions on the board, odds are they'll get hit first.
---
Hell, with that new Battlecry minion that reduces the cost of Dragons in your deck by 2, you could get a 7 cost Malygos in your hand. You could play Malygos with a full hand and then this. You'll get (1 + 5) \* 8 = 48 random damage. That's Trolden material.
---
Just me or is there significantly less time?
---
Found the Resurrect Priest.
---
Might want to craft this in gold for future nerfing
---

---
Remember when we didn‚Äôt have legendary spells?  Remember when we didn‚Äôt have Hero cards?  Remember when we didn‚Äôt have Legendary weapons?  Remember when Druid, Priest, Warlock, Mage didn‚Äôt have weapons? Remember when we didn‚Äôt have multi-class cards?  Remember when we didn‚Äôt have a spell without a mana cost?
---
In fact, given enough games, it should be exactly 6500 (but there aren't gonna be enough games).
---
Will this card dominate the meta like Evolve Shaman? I don't know.
---
However, the potential for curvestone is there. Try to keep your mana curve low and hope for turn 1 Embiggen. 
---
Maybe even add some Innervates to compensate for the extra mana cost for a couple of turns and just start hitting your enemy with oversized minions. 
---
However, like any minion based deck I believe it will lose to "unfair" decks who ignore the board like OTK Paladin or Freeze Mage.
---
The difference between this card and Corridor Creeper is that we all KNOW this card is completely broken.
---
How original.
---
Nice argumentation, with personal aggression an anything, you must be right for sure.
---
Only in the way  where given enough games it would be exactly 6501.
---
I‚Äôve done this! I also lost that game. The stats on it dont scale well at all
---
remember when we didnt type such a long answer to a joke?
---
Most definitely how it reads
---
Play this with a \[\[Millhouse Manastorm\]\] = rank 1 Legend btw.
---
It will make it possible, but not viable.  Full cost so only one a turn and its not even guaranteed.  Also Shudderwok tends to fill up your hand so you could even burn the second copy.
---
Leeroy comes out on 5. It would be a pretty inefficient and awkward combo. Especially since he‚Äôs not really used outside 1 turn combos. Maybe it‚Äôll be used, but I wouldn‚Äôt be too concerned.
---
No clues what you mean by that.

If you spend all dust making a deck that will rotate soon, you're shooting yourself in the leg.
---
They design set one year in advance, if they realize they've gone too far they have enough time to adjust. They managed to make singleton and quest deck interesting and didn't need silver bullet, adding a tech like that and calling it a day is the laziest way to balance the set.

The problem is probably that the German Simpsons word is really weird and wouldn't really work while the English word is legit.
---
It sounds like a mix of "vergraulen" and "grantig" which are both pretty bad words.
---
Simpsons translators probably had a hard time coming up with a completely new word because in German you can always put words together so words like aufgr√∂√üern are already used somewhere.
---
Because people are idiots
---
Because then the card is useless. The only time you consider using the card is when armor gets to ridiculous levels and erasing 10 armor is just not enough.

My god this card is fucking insane

That you constantly get nudged toward 6500. So people should calibrate around 6500 given that they play enough games.

What the fuck are these cards official??
---
Yeah, I went and looked back, and it felt much more than that to me, but there indeed are very few (3/13 I believe). However, the 3/13 is a misleading number, since you are never gonna play with various Breath cards, since there's 1 per class. In "dragon" classes, you'll most likely have 1/2 cards be a dragon that is a dragon helper.
---
There are also a few "Discover a dragon" effect, which alleviates the burden of "holding a dragon". The "mono" effect isn't as bad as I thought though, that's a fact.
---
\+ /u/ugin2579
---
Yeah, I see it as really design-space/deck-building limiting. Any Dragon-themed deck that becomes popular is going to have to be top-heavy because playing &lt;5-cost dragons is now a giant liability.  
---
If it was "gain *poisonous* and rush" I would really like the design, as it could counter the really greedy Turn 8+ Dragon value plays and even take down the &gt;8-health guys.  
---
Tech cards are supposed to punish players being too greedy or going too all-in on certain synergies. This card punishes players with the audacity to... play a Faerie Dragon on-curve?

It was OP in Arena. In Constructed it was merely strong, and if it hadn't been for Arena, it wouldn't have required a nerf.

Yeah, that's what I said. It got nerfed because of how it affected Arena. Judging by its Constructed performance alone, it was merely a powerful card, not OP or in need of a nerf.
---
Well then control shaman from dalaran would love it vs control warrior too
---
The design ethos behind Priest, narrow or conditional yet powerful effects, and the focus on card generation over card draw is itself more of the issue.
---
Much like White in MtG, Priest is probably the most confused in terms of mechanical identity. 
---
The class, by default, is situated as control-combo almost out of necessity given what's in the Classic and Basic sets, but Warrior usually controls the board better, Warlock can assemble their combos faster, and Mage's freezing effects tend to have a higher ceiling than Priest's healing.
---
However, the Hero Power is more suited to keeping minions alive and well, pushing for more midrange decks, but the class also isn't allowed to have the sort of single target removal Rogue has access to or the sort of aggressive minions Paladin or Shaman has.
---
Granted, a complete revamp of the Classic set could help solve most of the most serious issues with the class, just evening out the quality of each class' fallback options.
---
Even with that though, a Midrange Dragon Priest somewhat similar to what Spiteful Priest was during the Witchwood could still be somewhat decent.
---
Defender of argus too, so you don't just die.

---
Each class has it's own playstyle with their own unique decks. Experiment and play what is right for you. I would wait till the meta settles down though to see the most optimal deck types.
---
&gt; But there‚Äôs a difference between epics like Vulpera Scoundrel and Epics like Wyrmrest Priestess. We‚Äôre not getting puzzling cards that may or may not be good but cards that are just obviously bad for the most part.
---
Er...so just to be clear you're filing Vulpera Scoundrel under "puzzling cards that may or may not be good"?
---
Cause Vulpera Scoundrel looked pretty obviously good to me, and not like some hard to figure out puzzle.
---
Puzzle cards to me would be like...Wyrmrest Purifier.  Do you use it with Hakkar?  Do you use it to counter Bomb Warrior?  Or to use something from the same set as Vulpera Scoundrel, Body Wrapper was a puzzle card (which I've seen used in a few different contexts like holy wrath paladin, and going infinite with Sudderwock).
---
lmao i was just about to comment how i also had a 40 hp win once... with patchwerk. but then i looked closer and it was literally that!
---
can you attack, transform an then re-attack ?
---
It was still too strong for a common 7 drop even in constructed
---
Fuck off
---
Rogue usually has a decent niche in Standard as a tempo oriented class, but it would be better to keep playing what you're playing until the next expansions drops in a week.
---

---
I believe shirvalla pally will play this combo
---
rarity doesn't and shouldn't determine power level
---
r/lostredditors
---
Arena lacks the swing power with removals and mana cheats of constructed. Instead of MC Tech being a minor inconvenience even if it steals your best minion like in standard, in Arena it‚Äôs is game-losing. The only way to play around a 1/4 chance of losing the game on the spot is to never have four minions.
---
Kill a thing, make another thing cards are often busted in arena (which is why Dragonslayer was so good) and this looks no different. For four mana, kill a thing and make a huge thing. The only way to play around it is to never play a dragon. 
---
The thing about this card that will break Arena is that 4 mana 4/4 is nothing to sneeze at in the format. There‚Äôs almost zero risk to drafting this card, with a payout of nearly winning the game whenever it‚Äôs activated. A better design would be something like Eater of Secrets (ok but not good in Arena) which has the drawback of having bad stats, so if you play it on curve without a secret from your opponent you‚Äôll be at a disadvantage.
---
But with 4/4 stats, he‚Äôs at worst an average four drop. That‚Äôs not a sufficient amount of risk baked into a card that becomes a 4 mana 8/8 WITH IMMEDIATE BOARD IMPACT using rush. Everyone will pick this whenever it shows up and it will make all dragons that aren‚Äôt as busted as Alexstraza or something irrelevant, and feel really bad to play.
---
The Entwives have returned!
---
How is having inconsistent card texts that do the same thing more clear?  I think what they value more than consistency and clarity is aesthetics and how much the cards are visually appealing.
---
Embiggen gives this +2/+2, then this makes another minion a copy of it which now also has +2/+2.
---
Wait that's illegal
---
This is the way.
---
maskrey#1181 trade NA, you go first plz.
---
In arena tempo is everything. Those cards are all extremely high tempo when they hit and can be game winning off that one huge swing
---
Playing this one on thief rogue after adding 40 cards that cost 1 into the deck =)))
---
Ohh okay total characters not total words
---
With Omega Devastator and Hogrider he gets an additional +10 attack and Charge!
---
People typically only play Leeroy as a finisher, so it's rare to see him on 5.
---
I would prefer "that cost 1 less"
---
I mean that‚Äôs cuz this card is horrible design.
---
I go with a more work with what you got type board, usually resulting in menagerie. It doesn‚Äôt guarantee true but your chances of not getting top 4 doesn‚Äôt increase that much and it makes it more likely to actually win. My strat is actually to win but still have a high chance of making top 4. I agree yours is better for top 4 but it‚Äôs not as fun for me.
---
I'm actually a huge fan of the stay at 3 approach. My way of doing it is:
---
3 gold: buy
---
4 gold: tier up
---
5 gold: sell buy buy
---
6 gold: buy buy
---
7 gold: if offered really good minions, buy buy. Or else buy tier up
---
8 gold: if you see a minion to dance on (any divine shield mech or crowd favorite, or replicating menace if you already have a divine shield mech. That's it) and you have tokens, then dance. If you don't have tokens you should buy, buy, sell something and buy leaving the minion you want frozen. If you don't see something to dance on roll until you do picking up tokens in the process.
---
9 gold: dance. Dance until you have 7 Mana remaining (unless it's cobalt guardian. Then you go all in, preferably till 10 Mana), then buy the danced, refresh and buy strongest unit and freeze if you see a dance target.
---
10 gold: if you have a frozen minion or you see a minion you want to dance on then buy the 3 other minions and freeze. If you don't see something you want to dance on reroll until you do, picking up tokens in the process.
---
Turn after: dance until 7 Mana, buy refresh buy.
---
Turns after: keep repeating 10 gold turn followed by 9 gold turn.
---
Important: try dancing on doubles because once your board starts getting full with high stats minions you will A: want to make space, and B: want to keep up with others' power level by turning 2 20/20 minibots into a 40/40. The exception to this is cobalt guardians. You don't want to triple them.
---
With this approach I mostly 2nd place, often 1st, sometimes 3rd and never ever lower.
---
Are you using the macOS or Windows version of it? Support for HSTracker (the macOS version) is coming soon!
---
I swear I can't watch Amaz because of this. Also his decision making is super questionable. Just a second ago he had 2x buffed cobalts and finally got a 3/1 deathrattle minibots mech and he magnetized it to cobalt instead of his Taunted divine shield amalgam and he lost a game. It was so fucking hard to watch. Entire fucking chat told him what to do and he did otherwise anyway, such an outside of box thinker /s
---
That's a good point. I distinctly remember them saying they weren't going to update the Zayle decks, but they do contain cards that will rotate out next April, so that is a problem.
---
Maybe Zayle will become a wild only card, but that doesnt make much sense either, and should draw heavy criticism.
---
You get 2 free (usually good) minions and you can freeze the board to get the Pogo on turn 3. You have a really good turn 3, so you dont need a good extra punch buying a good minion.
---
If using one more card is bming then you are delusional.
---
Oh nice, thank you.
---
I fail to see how this is relevant to anyone on this website

4/5/1 Mech | Rush

Wait... Does that card bring back the 1 cost shudderwick combo? As long as you get lucky order of that before grumle battlecry
---
Great art.
---
Trash effect.
---
its loosing the other persons time for no reason so yes is bming
---
An efficient two for one for 4 mana is very exciting any deck will try to fit that in it if possible. And this isn‚Äôt exactly that, this is more likely to kill a dragon and leave behind an 8/3 or 8/2 body behind to threaten to eat a quarter of your life total each turn you don‚Äôt answer it. If dragons see play This card will be obscene and make dragons not see play, or dragons will be good enough anyways and this will be in every deck, I don‚Äôt really like any of those options
---
Wish that these would stay in everyone's collections for Wild.
---
Coat, rip off doctor strange.
---
&gt; It buffs the cards only in your deck
---
Same as Keleseth.
---
We have seen this pop up since day one of the closed beta. maybe some streamer even saw it earlier in the streamer early access. Idk why these posts keep popping up it's like people cant take 2 seconds of their life to see if someone already posted it
---
But like. Golden decks man!! How else can I play ranked and shit myself to a ‚Äúgold‚Äù hunter that I end up stomping on cuz they‚Äôre not actually gold!!
---
imo, the problem with platebreaker is that it's a card with decent stats that's fine on its own, but has a incredibly powerful effect in a lot of situations. using [[cloud prince]] as an example, platebreaker is capable of basically the same thing or better with no stat drawback or anything of the sort.
---
I guess it's sparking one up on your behalf.
---
Also using the whole turn is bming? No.
---
Is playing one card every ten seconds bming because you want to make things right? No.
---
Then, if I want to heal myself for 12 because it's satisfying to see the life at 30 + 90 armor then i'll do it. Wasting just 2 seconds is not waste at all. 
---
If the rope makes you angry stop playing
---
I had a similar situation today.  I liked it though. Because it showed a better rating -\_-.

5/4/4 Elemental | Battlecry: If you control a Secret, deal 6 damage.  
---
i think this card is actually a very favorable early game removal, it all but guarantees that you'll clear an early board, especially considering that as a handlock you wont be likely to play minions in the first couple of turns. Late game it can also pair with hellfire to pick off the lingering minions that werent cleared by the initial AOE
---
uuuu someone got mad cause he bms uuu
---
But if the meta gets bettwr I would prefer them to stay. The thing is, whenever they add powerful cards back to stardard they HAVE to be watching the meta and remove some of them if the meta sucks
---
I mean you are whining here, not me
---
Heh. Its funny time was that with every expansion that introduced powerful taunts people used to ask it is time for Black Knight to return i.e. AOE drake.
---
How to use:  
---
1. Emperor Thaurissan into Floop on the same turn. Targets are:
---
Doomsayer(2x)
---
Star Aligner
---
Baleful Banker  
---
2. Elise the targets  
---
3. Use Banker on Elise  
---
4. Doomsayer(2x) -&gt; Star Aligner  
---
5. Repeat steps 2-4
---
same.
---
The reason I always think it is 6 is because I know in my head that it was nerfed by 1 mana, and it is crazy to think that he used to only cost 4.
---
Yeah but since everything is buffed, you wouldn't want to transform your buffed minion intro thiz
---
wtf me too
---
Yep it‚Äôs definitely a good strat. As I said in another comment this method has a greater chance of getting top 4 but a lower chance at winning due to players getting better at scaling up in the late game. I still like to try and win. Also I don‚Äôt like how this method forces you into a mech play style. It can be really discouraging if you aren‚Äôt offered many mechs or if your opponents gets lucky and take most of the good mechs.
---
What????
---
Playing the game?
---
Used this like twice. You can win on the Druid‚Äôs cards alone though, won a couple without having to do the combo cause I had lethal or had to go full control cause they were aggro
---

---
Another Customhearthstone card lol
---
Does it pull the minion or does it just summon it? I thought that's what the recruit keyword was for.
---
Very cool card. Definitely something you'd run in a Reno deck.
---
Well let me tell you about a card called ‚ÄúRolling Fireball‚Äù...!
---
What happens when it strikes a divine shield? Under explosive runes logic, my guess is that 8 - health of shielded minion will be then split left and right.
---
RIP Flame Lance
---
Unfortunately (or luckily?) Thunderhead triggers after the spell's effect, so you won't get 2/2s with rush. Still very good though, especially if you're playing multiple overload cards that turn.
---

---
r/customhearthstone on suicide watch
---
You generally only want to use it for bunnies and metaltooth leapers. If possible, use it for every pogo after the first.
---
Cool, a worse version of acornbearer in a class that doesn‚Äôt have wide buffs.  And no, playing a 1 mana 1/1 just to activate combos is not good.
---
This is an invoke lover, not invoke card
---
You sell all your minions and get a bunch of 2/2 xD
---
5
---
shudderwock as a card is awesome. that effen audio though is the literal worst in the game.
---
So was Barnes. 
---
This has insane potential though...
---
Landing a 5/5+ potential 8/8...12/12...4/12...etc beefy dragons...it can be outright game winning high roll on curve lol.
---
The worst case scenarios are pretty bad but damn if the high roll possibilities aren't nuts on turn 6....
---
A significantly worse [[Meteor]] but we can't play that anymore. It's not clear as of now whether the damage continues as long as things keep dying, but in that case it can clear a board full of small things... maybe. As a board clear it would cap out at killing 1 health minions as anything more than that would exceed the 8 damage cap, so using it for that purpose is like paying 5 mana for an Arcane Explosion. The flexibility this provides is not worth including it in my opinion. 
---
Very weak card, but interesting effect.
---
This seems broken?

Carnivorous Cube 2.0

Seems a lot better after they revealed the dude with the same effect to equip a Truesilver Champion for free.

---
Are you confusing shaman and warlock again?
---
If there are 2 minions after hiting one with it the second is always hit too.
---
Other than Convincing Infiltrator, what's really worth casting this on at the moment?
---
Hi cube
---
One the best ways to turn off new players is have 100 keywords they have to learn when starting the game.
---
Think about other perspectives besides your own sometime. It will serve you well.
---
Appears potentially better. You don't get a Cube body, but you get to keep the minion you're targeting
---
There's gotta be a broken combo somewhere involving this.
---
Put this on the right minion (reborn or deathrattle ?) and you just have a a sticky board, great card.
---
Not just possible‚Äîit's good. 7/10 wins on turn one for me just now. People will probably start to adjust with more turn one taunts, but at the moment, it's easy wins.
---
Get a load of this troll everyone.
---
&gt; so that a good deck built around this card ends up having a 50/50 win chance against most top tier decks for the next 3 months
---
Maybe we could play the cards first before we make such bold predictions.
---
seems pretty good
---
my guess would be if there is a minion on only one side, it will go that side, but if there is a minion on both sides it will rng.
---
Firefly was two 1/2‚Äôs for two mana and this is three 1/1‚Äôs for three mana.  This is not nearly as good.
---
This + Leeroy
---
How are they printing an epic spider tank
---
Doomsayer
---
Thank God
---
Don't you mean: 9 Mana 32/32 Rush! OH NO.
---
A 88 rush for 4 is way worse than a lot of cards if you need it to trade with an 8/x. Shadow word death and Big Game Hunter from the top of my head. 
---
If the meta becomes filled with 88 dragons, I'd much rather have bgh than this card.
---
This can counter the paladin nozdormu if you are lucky enough
---
They get an 8/8 though
---
So if it hits something and deals 5, does it deal 3 to the rest of everything, or does its damage go down, say it hits a 1 health minion it deals 2 to the next?
---
Base cost is 8 Mana
---
Ooo this is an interesting archetype, very unique trying to build Paladin only deck
---
Shudderwock is already powerful enough, and the battlecry isn't bad. Summoning 2 8/8s with rush is no pushover
---
Would it be good to put this on [[Doomsayer]] or the new [[Depth Charge]]? Makes it really difficult for your opponent to get the board clear removed without the use of a silence.
---
8 mana
---
What happens when you have an acolyte of pain ?

2/0/7 | At the start of your turn, destroy ALL minions.

This replaces arcane Giant in wild quest mage.
---
Base cost is 8 Mana.
---
Arcane Giant is back.
---
It starts out with"both players" in the text.... So it's implied any follow-up effect will also impact "both players".
---
Think it's worded fine personally
---
I don't know... it seems *very* slow and greedy.
---
This will probably be a great midrange card... if the new Dragonmaw poacher doesn't see play. It's stronger than Azure Drake as others have stated.
---
There's got to be a Leeroy Jenkins OTK with this somehow.
---
That seems logical. Cheers.
---
This seems good in the wild quest mage that uses arcane giants!
---
So, what's the original cost?
---
Don't let the naysayers name us Purity Paladin- PalyPaly is the only name I will accept
---
Well, yeah. It says it right there
---
The decks are garbage, and not even the fun kinda garbage.

---
You can't say that more than 15-20 times for the neutral set. This isn't even a dragon.
---
Nice guide, but you may want to repost this when the card reveal stream isn't currently on.
---
This card is gonna be crazy in arena if you have any 1/2/3 drops left from earlier turns
---
Ugh, I seriously hate brawls like this. Getting combo'd or outvalued by old legendaries is never fun.
---
WHERE'S YOUR BOMB LOBBER NOW?
---
A NEW GIANT!!!
---
Khartut Defender.  Besides creating an extensive wall of taunts, it also bumps up healing from 6 to 18.  Extremely useful defensive combo.
---
Uhh isn't the batrider also supposed to die when it does the damage?
---
Obviously very similar to [[Carnivorous Cube]] but it's worth noting that Priest generally plays very weak minions and then buffs them. Summoning two copies would probably summon two very weak minions unless you're in the waaay late game and they're playing this on a Ysera or something, but in that case you're either a greedy deck yourself or you already lost. 
---
Not actually killing the minion is both a benefit and a drawback of this card compared to the Cube. Priest generally doesn't play powerful deathrattles, though. It's also worth mentioning that the Cube itself provided a 4/6 body and its deathrattle could be triggered before it died. However the fact that the minion doesn't die is a benefit if it has Taunt, as this creates a triple barrier that needs to be broken through.
---
I think it's better to think of this as two [[Ancestral Spirit]] stapled together rather than comparing it to Cube. I could see this being the first card cut from greedy priest decks when they realize they're losing too much. 
---
Side note: On a [[Khartut Defender]] this would create *six* taunts and 18 healing. Very strong turn 10 play but very weak to silence. Also, N'zoth is gone so you don't need to worry about this combo creating a full board of OUR HOME OUR TOMBS on its own.
---
I think PalyPaly is the way to go!

So wait does it mean remaining deck? Like if I include a neutral card in my deck and draw it before I play this new card does the battlecry still activate? Or is it like when I played Genn Greymane his effect wouldn‚Äôt activate if I had a quest in my deck even though it was in my starting hand.
---
Why would you do that when you can just play Mass Hysteria?
---
Who claims 477 is op? It hasn't really ever been. Just a big pile of stats that lose you the game if it dies the turn you play it.
---
That would be smart but I am not
---
How can I trust that when youre just throwing numbers around lol. You claim to know mine, yet im supposed to trust you when you claim yours? 
---
lol ok
---
Oh man I forgot about it auto-picking.  That‚Äôs the worst!  In that scenario there‚Äôs no chance of playing the card so just cancel the discover and let us keep the card.  It‚Äôs insult to injury right now
---
Also did I mention reborn mech control also had shaman spells, being the reason it was called identity crisis paladin?
---
yup that could work too
---
Well it depends on the deck you're playing but generally it's underwhelming, but think of the possibilities! 2 murozonds!
---
This makes me suspicious that this person DOES NOT KNOW that face is the place
---
Not by a long shot. I'd be surprised if this card saw play outside of aggro paladin, if that's even a deck.
---
Does this mean we can un-nerf ancient of lore now?
---
On paper it sounds terrifying, but actually not so much. Basically 4 dead cards until combo turn is too heavy to carry and does not influence any losing match ups.
---
Seems pretty solid, both the hero power and the battlecry. And shudderwock plays this again, pretty good overall.
---
Technically it costs the same as whatever the card is based on is called.
---
Trades the admittedly good side of being able to get it out on turn 3 for the payoff. Seems good
---
Yes but friday we can also play with the cards... but only the cards you open and you cant use cards from other sets(I think anyways)
---
probably not tier 1, especially with the amount of absolutely insane cards this expansion, but id go as far as to say that it probably outclasses token druid at this point and could maybe be a T2 or T3 deck
---
Flame Imp.
---
EZ BIG EZ DRUID EZ
---
Not particularly.
---
Paladin has a big enough dragon package with this expac to make it possible I'd say.
---
You can‚Äôt really ‚Äútake care‚Äù with which cards to include when you have literally no options in the first place.
---
I'm sensing some interesting potential with this and poison. If you ever need to guarantee one of your minions dies the turn you play it, you can cast ramming speed on it and have it hit a neighboring Evasive Chimaera. On the other hand, you can combine this with Marsh Drake's 2/1 to develop a 5/4 dragon while killing an enemy minion.
---
Did you disconnect?  I noticed that if you did, and re-connect, additional time will be giving.  So either you did, or someone else did.
---
This happens every expansion. And every time I‚Äôm still disappointed after a month of gameplay. 
---
If I were you I‚Äôd wait for a month or so and see if the meta settles into a fun or frustrating spot. (Because chances are, it‚Äôll be frustrating)
---
Wow, book of specters has incredible synergy with this sidequest since you can tutor out three spells before drawing three minions, almost eliminating the chances of discarding anything.
---
I used Barnes example as if he were being run in a generic deathrattle/end of turn effect build. To compare with how this card could operate in a generic dragon minion build.
---
Not every deathrattle or end of turn effect is as strong as some. Just like dragons. Barnes hitting slyvannas/rag can be a lot nuttier then hitting a loot horder or something more basic.
---
You'd have to build entirely around Barnes like spell Hunter used to with the only minions being Barnes and yshaarj or big priest obviously. 
---
We might see a big dragons only type deck this upcoming X-Pac to build around this card to help the variance odds in your favor.
---
I agree. I think this archetype could work if they had a few more support cards. Those effects aren't strong enough to build around. They really do need to figure out what they want the class to be. OTK paladin has been the most consistent deck outside of mech.
---
So that season just play rogue v rogue or control warrior thanks.
---
No, i think they are comparable as they literally have the same battlecry. And as i said i would prefer the 2 mana guy without any further synergy.
---
The ironic thing is that, by choosing Embiggen specifically, this post got tons of flack. Meanwhile the subreddit was complaining about Frizz Kindleroost (reduce cost of dragons in your deck by 2) for much the same reason.
---
As usual, people miss your point completely and find a way to disagree with something they agree with.
---
I feel like all of the other class Invoke pay offs are so strong and some of the class specific Invoke cards are good enough that you really ought to play at least four Invokers though.
---
Value and control are different decks. Dire Frenzy Zulgin Hunter could outvalue Odd Warriors easily when that was the meta. Look at something like Rogue too, they are stupidly good at value (kinda so much it's unfun) with infinite N'Zoth/Tess, but they don't have good control tools still.

I both love and hate this
---
Wretched reclaimer gives you three full health copies of card and a 3/3 for the same cost as cube + 1 mana activator. 
---
It is also insane with vivid nightmare for two copies of a friendly minion that both summon another two copies of friendly minion
---
Warlock, historically speaking, has been absolutely incredible. Although the class has certainly been in a weak spot for the last couple of expansions. 
---
An archetype called ‚Äúhandlock‚Äù appears to be getting some support with Descent of Dragons, and handlock is traditionally one of the more popular &amp; effective Warlock archetypes, so we‚Äôll see how that goes.
---
Warlock also by far has the best heropower. The class will never be out for the count for *very* long with an ever present draw-a-card-button. Classes always swing in &amp; out of favorability. Shaman and Priest both have had stretches longer than a year of being worse than Warlock currently is, for example.
---
Didnt mark also have a secondary effect because of enchanted raven's tribe?
---
Better than Dr. Boom at 7 mana, right?
---
I was just listening to Dethklok lol "awaken, awaken, take the lifes that must be taken!"
---
E C H O
---
Because that s 4 dead cards in your deck. In wild you do not have luxury to afford it and actually does not help in any losing matchups.
---
It's not that season anymore
---
A lot of cards have the same battlecry. Obviously a 2 mana 1-1 and 5 mana 5-5 serve different purposes
---
Flame Lance just sucked. It could say deal 20 damage and would still never see play.
---
I never said that you should only run 2 Invokers in your Galakrond deck. That‚Äôs just idiotic.
---
It defiantly seems like a powerful set, after a few expansion that only have had powerful chase cards. 
---
That being said, I would wait, and just start by watching some streamers. See if the meta is still interesting to you after a few weeks, and if it is go for it!
---
Yeah and its still an awful standard card
---
Remember 1 hp cards? How about buffquest?
---
The only think I came up with is the doomsayers and star aligner. The rest I got from dane
---
handlock is a real archetype with specific cards and i‚Äôm so here for it

The real identity crisis paladin is just trying to mix as many archetypes as possible into one deck
---
Im really optimistic about this one, cyclone mage desperately needed a one drop, this one gives you more cyclone fuel, and is a cheap activator for the new subquest that you dont need to hold onto like you do with mana cyclone and chenvalla
---
Better corrupter, early damage is more important and has better cost to stat ratio.
---
How is the fact op appreciate the streamer or not relevant with the performance of said streamer? It was the first time he was doing this, it might be worth mentioning...

It kinda makes sense. It deals damage equal to the minions health, then the rest to the hero. If it sees 4 health, it deals 4 damage.
---
But whizbang is standard
---
Dr. Boom was told to buy ritual daggers, but there was a clearance sale on used ritual axes that he couldn't refuse.

You people are so anal about stupid shit to the point where it‚Äôs long since ceased being funny. This has literally zero impact on gameplay or your ability to understand the card.
---
Arrrrrrr
---
lame
---
There were 2 meta spiteful decks: Priest and Druid. Any other spiteful deck bordered on meme territory.
---
Priest ran 2 Mind Controls and 2 Free From Ambers.
---
Druid ran 2 Ultimate Infestations. That's it. In fact, druid didn't even have an 8 cost spell until Rise of Shadows.
---
So no, the 'majority" of spiteful decks did not run 2 10 costs, and 2 8 costs. 1 did, and 1 didn't.
---
Let's take Faerie Dragon and double it!
---
Right, that‚Äôs the way I would imagine they‚Äôd design it to work. I‚Äôm just spitballing on a possibility to see some spaghetti code in action if they haven‚Äôt coded this carefully. Good thing Team 5 is known for diligently ironing out foreseeable bugs like this one! Right? ...

are you suggesting that yeti isn't still the optimal turn 4 play in 2019???
---
It seems extremely likely that it keeps rolling, the wording would be different if it were just once.
---
Just play Whizbang for the first week of the expansion. That way you don't have to commit to anything and you can get a flavor of the expansion while the meta is unsettled.
---
Hellfire has all it in caps because it is a basic card
---
Which class is this?

---
Ohhhh.  Ok so I probably got it way back when and just forgot.  I don't play WoW so I'd never notice.  Thanks.
---
The album is missing the new Priest Legendary that plays all your opponents cards from the last turn.
---
Agree, but what decks play enough Mechs to make this consistently good? I can see it being played in Wild, **maybe**.
---
Generation Z I believe.
---
Good in arena, great on curve with a turn 5 lightning breath.
---
Draw 4, set them to 0 is absolutely sick. It will have a spot in the guaranteed.
---
All cards shown already on playhearthstone.com
---
At worst this is a 5 mana 5/5 worth of stats if you summon 2 tinyfin.
---
Back in KoFT when I first started, I dusted Valera the hallow to craft elemental mage. No regreerts. Shit deck tho, wouldn't beat anything today.
---
play galvanizer....  and snip snap with pirates and nightmare amalgam fits in there perfectly
---
He's talking about it costing you cards; azure drake cost a card and gave you one back while putting a 4/4 spell damage on the board. The mana cost is not significant in this discussion since we are talking about the card in hand cost; obviously it is not "free" since it costs 5 mana but it does not "cost" you a card.
---
Two magic tricks and an apprentice already get you a quarter of the way there, Cyclones get you the other six cards easy. This is gonna be obnoxious
---
Play right before you complete the druid quest against a non-druid opponent.
---
It's not a good combo, but it's a funny one.
---
&gt; whereas meteor will usually waste a lot of overkill
---
You're missing a key point here, which is the fact that Meteor itself was versatile for this very reason. Even if you're looking at a board with three 3/3s on it, Meteor would clear that board with 12 overkill whereas Rolling Fireball wouldn't clear it at all. Meanwhile if the center minion was a Deathwing, Meteor would *still* clear it whereas you'd only kill a single 3/3 with Rolling Fireball. 
---
Meteor was already triple removal that could double as a nuke to remove one giant target, or it could do both at the same time if circumstances permitted. Rolling Fireball doesn't remove anything but an 8/8, and likely can't kill most 3-minion boards unless those minions are tiny. Using it to clear a board full of 1/1s is terrible and as soon as they bump up to 2/2s you can barely even clear half the board. Its versatility is being vastly overstated.
---
Bonfire was actually a really strong card too, there just wasn't an elemental package that was stronger than the Jaina control deck at the time.
---
place it on the left or right most minion and there is no RNG
---
C H O N K
---
3 damage is better than 2, and the 5/4 body was actually pretty good: threatening a 5 health minion.
---
This card is less value, more aggressive. I wouldn't say it's better just different.
---
You underestimate the necessity to go very fast for Pirate Warrior in Wild. By the point you can cash in on this mech you are already staring at Voidlords and 10/10 Paladin mechs. In standard it may be great, but too slow for wild.
---
If you're not gonna use any invoke cards you just scrap galakrond too, he's pretty bad when by himself.
---
Pure Pally
---
Yeah but the thing is, for an effect like this it's almost always good to have low mana cost, as you don't want to pay mana for raw stats without rush or taunt most of the time. And it limits the cards you can play the same turn you draw the card. The new dragon card reducing the cost of this 5-5 guy is a different story though.
---
Why aren't you banned yet? That's racist!
---

Stegodon saw play during KFT. If this doesn't, we can talk about powercreep
---
GVG and Old Gods didn't have secrets either.
---
6.3k but essentially same thing xD
---
buy packs with all. but buy them in small amounts and track your pity timer. for example if you get a legendary in your 60th pack, you don't need to buy 8 more packs as it's unlikely that you will get much value.
---
A very similar card which saw zero constructed play.
---
And even easier to execute the combo twice as you will only need 1 spell to destroy the "cube"
---
Be cool to try throwing in Finley mrglton to change ‚Äútheir‚Äù hero power after stealing it to something shitty, then swapping back
---
In that case I'd spend almost all of it on packs. Like you say, you can save some for an arena run or two if that's something you'd like to do. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Though I do buy plenty of packs when a new expansion comes out, I generally spend all of my gold on packs as well, and then save essentially all of my gold (I don't play arena anymore) until the next expansion comes out, etc. etc. It usually comes out to a ton of packs if I have been playing consistently and not missing out on quests.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to factor everyone else‚Äôs picks and open taverns ‚Äî you‚Äôre likely off by at least a factor of 120
---
Just merge it, Puradin
---
SI7 is not good enough these days. This would be strong in any other expansion, but I'm not sure this one even makes the cut.
---
Think purity of the light‚Äôs champion.
---
Asuming you have 6800, I'd keep track and try to open until I get a legendary, while having around 1k left. 
---
If you actually have 68000 don't open over 180 packs, that's well enough to get usable cards and dust to craft whatever you like that you don't have.
---
In topdeck mode SI7 doesn't work either since you have nothing to combo it with.
---
I do exactly that too. I'm thinking of going all in for this set lol. So many crazy cards
---
I hate to say it but i lost to him and he lived with 1hp... what a legend.
---
He's just big-boned.
---
those were long time ago. a long streak has been broken it seems.
---
You haven‚Äôt seen snip snap and or renolock in wild have you?
---
By the elements combined !
---
Is that Yrel? Would have liked her to be a legendary card.
---
It would be disgusting with any other galakrond, but they made sure priest had a horrible power so it's fine
---
Twitch chat. Sophisticated. OmegaLUL.
---
But more neutral Galakrond cards would have mean evil classes could run Highlander Galkrond decks. With access to so few invoke cards, they now can't do that.
---
That would be too OP.
---
Maybe balance it out by adding Overload: (2) or something.
---
#THE END IS COMING
---
Might wanna throw another one. Not quite sure if it‚Äôs enough...
---
And that card was as relevant as Wind-up Burglebot
---
Animal Companion is a beast card.
---
It's not the first set to not have a Secret, and it's not like we need new ones every single expansion.
---
Yeah 6800* is the right amount. Well usualy with 50 packs i get ~3 legends. It's just that this set seems op some legends are off the charts
---
So now you can get 6 truesilvers
---
I love the artwork for this and the fact it‚Äôs all 7‚Äôs
---
Was coming to make the reference, beat me to it Well Played.
---
If it just said deal 20 damage I think it might have seen play.
---
Only on test servers, not on live
---
If you play a lot I think it's worth going on all in just about every set, with very few exceptions. If you're diligent about saving your gold between expansions you can certainly craft a couple of good decks with gold alone. Add some packs bought with cash, you're good to go on pretty much any release.
---
Your opponent wouldn‚Äôt need another dragon if you‚Äôre playing Leroy to summon whelps
---
Yeah that's true. Thanks!
---
I mean you had a similar sort of power creep trend running up to KnC after which they toned things back down again with witchwood, maybe things will loop around like that again eventually
---
I never said it did. Someone mentioned it was just a cheaper Phoenix, which had no condition at 4 mana
---
Oh, that makes sense, probs for the best then flavorfully and balance wise
---
I mean, a spell that summons a beast isn't very far from a beast card.
---
/s??
---
Nothing is wrong with priest but the card you referenced in your post isn‚Äôt a mage card but a priest card lol
---
what deck? I wouldn't be surprised if pirate warrior ending up not good enough for a meta, but this card does, to res some key weapons in different classes.
---
If only I could upvote more than once (on special occasions like this of course)
---
Why tf Blizzard kills the archetypes? Control warrior is impossible in the face of all combo and infinite value decks, but they add armor destroyer. Now they want to kill Quest mage in Wild!

First, I'd wait to actually see how the meta pans out before declaring Warlock unplayable. Second, you don't have much ground to stand on to complain if you choose to only play one class. You'll inevitably screw yourself over sooner or later going that route.

That's just untrue. It was actually pretty solid on Ladder as a tier 2 or 3 deck. It always held a 53% winrate or higher.
---
That's apeshit, jesus
---
Fair enough... if you're focusing on Wild, I'd wait until the meta settles a bit. It's extremely hard to predict what the standard meta will do after an expansion, let alone the chaos that is Wild mode. It might turn out that only  a handful of cards actually make it into tier-1 decks. For example, SN1P SN4P doesn't really even need anything else right now to dominate, and I doubt that will change unless it gets nerfed...
---
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs incredible!‚Äù
---
Thank you for playing Wing Commander!
---
Inb4 next expansion centers around giving every class their own secrets.
---
Oh ok, that makes a lot more sense. I'm at 4300 after saving since the beginning of November.
---
Commander is a format from MTG. The premise is you choose a Legendary minion to be your commander. Your commander can be played at any time as it doesnt go in your deck and sort of sits off to the side of the board. When a commander dies or is removed from the board it goes back to this stop and can be cast again for 2 extra mana for each time it has died this game. The format is also normally singleton, which is why I think most people are saying the highlander cards need to be auto banned.
---
Let‚Äôs pray
---
I hope this is a joke or something because literally none of these are power creep.
---
Who knows, I remember seeing somewhere that it takes them two weeks to make a patch and get it to a point that they are happy with. Considering the patch is meant to come out tomorrow it is likely that the bugs shown will be with it

---
Probably dead. No one else is going to stop them anyways since the Alliance and Horde are too busy fixing death after sylvanas? broke it
---
To be fair doubling the invokes are pretty decent for board control, and you don't even need many invoke cards to sprinkle in. Then you tap Galakrond to get 4 8/8's and a 5/2 weapon to push for lethal, and if that doesn't work initially Shudderwock can get you that 5/2 weapon again along with 2 more 8/8's that probably will get you to lethal.
---
So I'm a Yugioh player and we often get the exact opposite criticism. That our card text is too long and needs more keywords.
---
I think when it comes to hearthstone they take a really bad approach to keywords. Using keywords *sometimes* but not all the time for the exact same thing. Which is what this post is talking about.
---
Where hearthstone has failed in my opinion is not making wise choices on when to implement these keywords. I absolutely think Recruit should be on the above card. Summoning a minion from your deck is a mechanic that is going to be ever present in the game, like Battlecry or Deathrattle. That said I also think not having the keyword at all would have been perfectly fine, since it doesn't take a lot of words to have. 
---
Basically what I'm saying here is inconsistency is a problem and it shouldn't be written of because new players. Hearthstone even has an advantage to physical games when it comes to keywords since it can display their meaning next to them when playing so new players don't have to memorize them. Lastly I think for the keywords we do have the game could make it easier for new players to understand by possibly having a glossary of some sort that lists all the explanations for these keywords.
---
Ultimately my point is inconsistency is bad even considering new players.
---
Of course you shouldn't use galakrond until you have steam. 
---
The ideal order should be: use everything you have until you run out cards (in hand or in deck) -&gt; the oppo is still alive? if yes use galaktron -&gt; is the oppo still alive after 4 8/8? if yes, use shuddershock
---

---

---

---
Big priest support lol.
---
Have I miscounted, or is this the 23rd neutral common of this set? Normally there's 22.
---
*####Call to Arms*
---
I think the rush card is so bad (overcosted by 1, whereas the taunt is arguably well statted and costed) that we'll be seeing neutral Invoke cards in next year's expansions, simply because 6 Invoke cards doesn't seem like enough to enable a Galakrond deck. I think Priest Galakrond could be a thing because they have the more usable Invoke cards of the bunch with a Pharaoh Cat that generates a worse-on-average card but has a higher high roll potential and an Assassinate that does the same. 
---
Not losing card advantage usually makes cards stronger by a surprising amount. Assassinate is a 43-45% winrate card by all accounts, but add card generation for no cost and it just might be decent. Pharaoh Cat is a brilliant card played in most standard Rogue decks with about a 53% winrate. As for the taunt, Rotten Applebaum is a 49-50% winrate card with an effect that could be argued to be slightly worse than generating a card. Galakrond's Shield is a fair card, -2 stat points away from vanilla but an upside roughly valued at 1-mana. And there's also a theoretical mana value (1&gt;X&gt;0) to advancing Galakrond, so these cards should all be slightly better still.
---
Galakrond's removal battlecry and the possibility of 10 direct damage from a fully powered Galakrond could possibly put control Priest back on the map. Priest can potentially make a Khartut Defender wall with its new Carnivorous Cube lookalike. These high manacost combos can be alleviated with its "if you've invoked twice" card. Alexstrasza is going to sit on your hand for Dragon synergies. They have earlygame board clears again in the Breath, which could invite Thalnos. Hysteria and Plague. Infiltrator. Randomly generated cannon fodder. It just might be enough.

---
Gotcha. Thank you
---
eh, it's not that the card is inherently bad. It just didn't really do anything that worked with priest. Although if it's generated through Galakrond it wouldn't be bad to play. It's possible they were making cards the last 3 expansions with Priest Galakrond in mind.
---
Magic does it more or less exactly the same as Hearthstone?
---
You have the core set of keywords (charge/haste - deathtouch/poisonous - defender/taunt - etc, etc.) and then they'll have a new keyword or two per set, which eventually rotate out so new players only need to learn the basics, and what is currently in standard.

Ok thats vaguely tempting

Stand against darkness pog.

Any chance the link to the stream is back up for those of us who had to miss it? Can‚Äôt find it anywhere....

I'm playing Stormwind Knight, DS, Inner Fire priest until I get that turn OTK and I'm getting out. If I don't draw it, I'll just concede.
---
They legally cannot give credit. If they did happen to see this as a custom card they cannot legally make it.
---
It could be better right now, but most of the warlock cards for DoD look solid. This could be the weakest one, and even then it's a much better whirlwind.
---
You get *four 8/8s*. This isn't run in quest, quest is run in this.
---
What part of that was supposed to be  sarcastic?
---
My thoughts exactly! Also, the fact it's an epic means that it completes the whole color scheme with a little bit of purple.
---
Yup, my initial comment somewhere here sees this being used mainly by aggro decks and tempo/lackey decks for the 1/1s. Specifcially for Zoolock, its like adding another one of the 3/3 Evil Summoners for improved consistency in using the lackeys.
---
Yeah sure if you have nothing to do with your other 3 mana cards.
---
Y‚Äôall keep saying this but the game, since it‚Äôs inception, has hired dozens of different artists to draw card art every expansion. The entire set has never in the history of HS has the same style unless you play zoomed out on mobile and only see vague JPEGs of the card art

That be so broke you guys are so stupid üòÇüòÇ

3/-/- | Choose a friendly minion and give it to your opponent.

Really unfortunate that I recently picked up Alleria cause I hate Rexxar and now have to replace her cause I love Sylvanas more than anything in the world üòû
---
This in theory lets you have a Turn 3 5/6 Nightmare.

When the expansion was first announced, the article on Blizzard's website said they're returning to traditional adventure design i.e not another Dungeon Run. Thank god, that formula got stale with Rumble Run and they reused it twice after that!
---
They can‚Äôt give credit.  The card designers are forbidden from seeing custom cards.
---
One thung is not clear. If I have a board full of wisps, does this spell kill them all? Or only two of them?
---
‚ÄòTiss a card that plays with minion placement, just like the legends have foretold.
---
This is a great idea! Shame they don't have people who'd think the same way in their small indie company.
---
I have a self made Wild deck that I took to rank 5 that is Highlander Elemental Mage. It's early game is a little rough, but mid to late game it's very strong.
---
Better than arcane intellect since it gets discounted by 2 for each treant.
---
I haven't looked at any of them and definitely won't. Blizzard need to stop this nonsense.
