Thanks.  Will give it a try. 
---
---
---
Yup. This is the make or break expansion for me. 
---

---
With the “old mechanics returning” theme in this expansion, it feels like they know it too. I could even see this expansion being made to soften a blow for a hearthstone shutdown, getting the Heroes of the Storm treatment. The game is stale. It hasn’t been popular for 3 years now and it’s dead on twitch and Reddit. It kind of sucks, because it seemed to always be in the “future potential” stage, but it just never moved out of it. People got fed up with the crap and quit. 
---
Sorry if this seems overly pessimistic. I enjoyed this game as well, hit legend a few times, I have played for 4ish years. I would play for hooours. I’ve played against players like Naimath, Ant, Hotform. It was really fun but my interest has increasingly dwindled as the game stagnated. It became repetitive. Boring. Oh well. 
---
The death of a game is always a sad thing, and I’ll always remember hearthstone for introducing me to the world of strategy/puzzle/card video games. 
---
I feel like this going to end up on hearthstone circlejerk now lol, but oh well
---
I’ll come back on rotation other then doing quests saving up gold I don’t play much anymore
---
That's what friends are for
---
Good to know.  It used to be garbage if I recall correctly 
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk just posted this lol
---
Thanks for reminding me this game exists. I dont play anymore. But hey.... at least its not fortnite or minecraft. 
---
The part that is fun about the constructed brawls is that they develop a meta and it's interesting to see an entirely new meta develop out of a seemingly simple game.  For instance the "pick 2 cards" and your deck gets filled with those cards was so fun.  It started with people doing like radiant + mind blast things and murkspark eel + flametongue and eventually really weird decks like shield block + upgrade! developed as a response that beat OTK decks and still had pressure.
---
The great part about limiting your play time to 30 minutes is you only disconnect 15 times.
---
Understood.
---
Mobile players feels this
---
People downvoting you getting wooshed
---
Happy cake day
---
Exact same for me 
---
I'll definitely look into it, I hope Warrior gets enough dragon synergy to push it to Dragon priest levels of amazing. 
---
Congrats on win. I’m glad to see people dealing with wall priest. Because of its low mastery level it’s becoming more and more common on ladder and is honestly a very oppressive and uninteractive deck.
---
Cathedral Gargoyle is rotating out.
---
Deck code plz
---
no memeS, with an S. we're allowed one. 
---
Greetings from /r/all, can anyone explain this meme to me?
---
Oof
---
It had a free trial back then. You had to cancel it before next month, though (if you didn't need amazon prime).
---
Another advice is : if you don't have opened any of those packs yet (Un'goro, frozen throne, kobolds), you might want to open at least a few. You have a legendary guaranteed in the first ten pack. If you don't plan to play wild it will give you easy dust with those legendaries.
---
Wow, that is accurate
---
Yeah fucking hell /u/Multi21 try harder next time smh 
---
I used naturalize, forest guide, mountain giant and ferocious howl, so no matter what I have either hand druid or Mill druid which are both terribly strong in a just 3 cards format 
---
&gt;\&gt; LOL I like how you immediately dropped the inflation arguement when I proved you wrong, and you're still ignoring my point.
---
Ha, I dropped it because there’s literally no argument to be had… I’ve never paid $100 for a Mario game. No one has. End of argument.   
---
Yes, inflation exists. Doesn’t change what people paid for it. 
---
&gt;\&gt; Mario was a bigger investment for a kid back then compared to buying a game today. People expect more features, longer and more support, but they want to pay less.
---
You’re completely ignoring that the competition and market is exponentially larger today than it was back in the 80s, but OK. 
---
Besides, that’s not uncommon in tech-driven industries. Computers cost less and offer more features now compared to that time period as well…what of it? 
---
&gt;\&gt; That's absolutely false, Game prices have stayed constant. Their value has only gone down due to inflation, unlike everything else where the price has increased to match inflation. Chocolate that costed a nickel then doesn't cost 3 cents now, and if you did that would be crazy.
---
Yes, game prices HAVE STAYED CONSTANT. As in, people used to pay $50 for games decades ago. Not $100. 
---
Can you not see how you’re just contradicting yourself? Probably not I suppose. 
---
&gt;\&gt; You can complain that games have too many transactions after the fact, *or* you can complain they don't have enough content. But you can't expect developers to give you more of both. 
---
Nice binary strawman argument. 
---
Truth is I can expect that supply and demand will create a balance in regards to cost and value… any other assumption on your part is absolutely pointless and meaningless. 
---
If developers continue to create bigger games in an increasingly efficient manner, that's what will dictate content and pricing. 
---
&gt;\&gt; Game developers need to pay for those million dollar games somehow, and saying "just sell more copies" is a bullshit argument in an age where people want to play games for years.
---
Ha, no it isn’t… the only bullshit argument here is yours. 
---
Ever heard of a game called Red Dead Redemption 2? It sold three-quarters of a BILLION dollars in THREE DAYS!
---
Guess how they did that? 
---
***JUST SOLD MORE COPIES.***
---
&gt;\&gt; They aren't buying new games all the time, they're buying new content for old games.
---
I don’t know what you mean by “all the time”, but people certainly are still buying new games en masse. See paragraph above for details. 
---

---
Just hit „done“ it will auto create a deck. Works 50% of the time for me. Other 50% I have to adjust or netdeck.

Yeah, the part that follows after is pretty cringy. But I just quickly googled up the article as it's still good summary of what happened until the first twitter embeds, instead of, you know, writing it myself.

Im glad they kept omega cards,  i really like the concept of a late game powerhouse card
---
I have nothing but love for f2p players. They are just as entitled to play this game as I am. But if we were all f2p there wouldn't be a game. So I don't understand the down votes, but I accept them. 
---
Is it just me, or now warrior has a way to deal with mechatun before the combo?
---
Yep. Especially trolls. Next I want a tauren hero. That'd be sweet. 
---
You need money for games. A lot of it. I don’t understand why people get so pissed about selling out like this.
---
And you would lose just like everyone else if you did that, because which ever cost reducer you get rid of, they still have one. So it's like removing nothing.
---
Is this a joke? 
---
No it really isn’t.
---
Emmeriss ??
---
This deck is definitely S-Tier in the format. I played a fuck load of Discard (Soularium, Soul Fire, Silverware Golem, Clutchmother), but it can struggle against things like Murlocs if they ban Silverware Golem. Your deck looks like it struggles against very little, regardless of ban. 
---
I think you might be proving their point. It wasn’t Roger that cheated in the tournament. Roger did not benefit from win trading, he conceded a game to someone once.
---
Thanks. Don’t worry, I lost the next one legit.
---
So in your mind the game industry is dead and only anti-consumer sellout crap can exist? Indie games don't exist? Kickstarter doesn't exist? It's either straight to NetEase and mobile cash shops or nothing? No inbetween? Fuck off
---
I havent seen this one for months lol
---
The Mech one which summons a 7/7
---
I’d go with myra 
---
I can attest to that for myself. I always build mine from scratch. I dont really enjoy this one because of the banable card and only using 3 cards but the "6 Shooter"  tavern brawl (you choose 6 cards to go in your deck, then shuffles them back in when you run out) i had like 43 wins and 6 losses. Never seen a deck out there like mine during that brawl and cant wait to build another!
---
So wtf is BfA
---
They re-used the old card art for Omega Defender
---
yea having a suscessful kick starter costs money and contract work pays a lot. but of course how dare someone you dont know try to raise funds 
---
I’m saying it’s not necessary to piss and cry whenever someone wants to support a company while getting money they need. Also you could be a bit less of a cunt perhaps?
---
It's true that the majority don't accept, but whenever I've wanted to add a few new friends I've found that if I request 20 in a row I'll get 5-6 accept. Greeting at the beginning of the match and Well Played at the end improves your odds IMO.
---
Easy Mira
---
And you could not jump straight to supporting NetEase perhaps?
---
How dare you regulate my merits?
---
If you have any dust, you should craft the cards that are going to Hall of Fame, because you will get all that dust back when the rotation happens. 
---
When you do that, you can easily build budget versions of various Even or Odd decks (based on Genn Greymane or Baku the Mooneater), which are perfectly fine decks to play until the rotation, capable of climbing even all the way to Legend.

Budget Odd Paladin: https://youtu.be/9lo3yAUmkHA

Make em' explode too. Wait...probably cross some form of line.
---
Yes!!! "6 Shooter" is the name!! I made an insane deck that went 43(W) and 6(L). There has to be a way we can request past brawls to play again, right? Right!?!
---
The Mage one seems very slow, but cool and unique. Priest improves if oracle becomes Northshire or even better Lightwarden. 
---
Or, yknow, mech hunter
---
I think the reason is because they really wanted to reuse the original omega defender art as an omega card because it has cool omega symbols all over it. I think they prioritized that over using a mechanic (no pun intended) from gvg.
---
Hmm 7 mana 7/7 deathrattle fill your board with boombots? Probably way too strong 
---
Dr boom is gana be too op with all the other heroes leaving, control warrior gana be op op
---
$50.....
---
Sorry for not using paragraphs, minor oversight by me.
---
Because I'm an odd warrior with 3 board clear playing with the *express* purpose of summoning lots of bakus.
---
Didnt they experiment with red mana crystals as a currency with the kabal too? 
---
Surprised? You shouldn’t be! This card has been in every meta since it’s release. No one knows why your grandfather put it into the Classic set when it was about to be rotated out of Standard.
---
How much is a token going for? I probably have shit gold right now. I’m not sure 
---
Obligatory grats now do it 8 more times comment
---
I think this might be the artwork for the Dr. Boom scheme as the other artworks featured in the presskit are for Togewaggle and Rafaam's schemes. So maybe summon 2 booms bots with deathrattle deal 1 damage, with the damage dealt being upgraded each turn?
---
Same day
---
They were only 111k when I got mine.
---
It was a sad day when i realized this. I main'd priest in vanilla because I had no good legendaries for a long time so I would play the one class that could get me ysara and rag since everyone else always ran those. 
---
I mean back in the good old days control warrior did run cruel taskmaster. Used it on acolyte and grom and enemy 2/1's.
---
I miss those days...
---
&gt; Another issue with “Lackey” being a keyword is that keywords are effects, not minions.
---
"[Spare Part](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Spare_Part)" such as from [Mechanical Yeti](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Mechanical_Yeti) has been used to describe a collection of 7 1-Cost Spells, and that was hardly an issue.
---
This is not unprecedented, believe it or not.
---
&gt; As we saw in the Evil Miscreant reveal video, the word “Lackey” isn’t even on the Lackey cards (except for the name of the card, but if you follow that logic then Possessed Lackey should be a Lackey).
---
That's not a "problem," that's just a nuance that you're perceiving to be a problem. There's a clear massive difference between 1 Mana 1/1 with Battlecry and 6 Mana 2/2 with Deathrattle.
---
&gt; TLDR: lackeys are a flavor disaster
---
Wow, melodrama much?
---
Again, I refer to Spare Parts. This isn't without precedent, and "keywords" 
---
Would it hurt if Lackeys were a Tribal instead? Probably not. But as it stands, Lackeys are a blend between Silver Hand Recruits/Treants, and Spare Parts. They don't need a Tribal, because they're a predefined set of uncollectable cards.
---
The same way we don't add Tribals onto every Death Knight or Dream Card. Or "Powerful Artifact" onto any of Arch-Thief Rafaam's Discover options.
---
I don't understand what the problem is.
---
Lackey is almost identical to how Spare Parts worked in GvG, a preset list of 1 mana, non-collectible cards grouped under a keyword. No one had issues with this.
---
Further, what would lackey being a tribe instead of a keyword do, really? The lackeys would be generated the same way, the wording on the generator would be the same and there'd still be nothing to interact with the lackey tribe unlike all the others like pirates, murlocs, dragons, etc.
---
Is there really a difference between "**Combo**: Add two random **Lackeys** to your hand." and "**Combo:** Add two random Lackeys to your hand."? Actually there is a difference, you don't even get the "vague" description with the latter.
---
Info: I just finished a battle in rumble run and turned off my phone because i had to do something. Turned my phone back on and hearthstone said "we had an error loading your collection" or something. Relaunched and i went from 65 gold to 365 gold. Not sure what that was about, but hey, 3 free packs!!

Remember when Mage got Let line Manipulator and people thought it would make Mage insane.. turns out it was just alright.

Shit I would. The game changes when you hit legend it’s not just net decks unless you are in dumpster legend. I’ve only made legend twice and I always have trouble climbing and can never get past rank 1. Whenever I have been at legend I always have more fun. I just want to play good games.

---
This is a poor card. This card should have either 1) if you overkill, fill your hand with lackeys 2) upgrades every turn (so its at least usable for single target removal in late game).
---
No, I just know what a strawman is. If you're not capable of understanding the differences between types of rhetoric, that's really your own problem. 
---
they confirmed they make expansions one year in advance. First phase is expansion ideas, second is card design, third is balancing.
---
Your the best. ♥️❤️💙💚💛💜💕💖💗💝💘💞💟💓
---
Why would meta change kill the game? Rotation happens every year, powerful cards leave, new metas arise, they even removed Genn and Baku to ensure we move away from Odd/Even decks. Most people don’t enjoy having same decks around for months on end. Even 4 months feels too long in bad metas.

Yes sorry! I meant Google calendar. Thanks!
---
Seems most likely based on forbidden and onega. Something that isn’t keyword but was unique for the expansion. The flipping fits this pretty well. We’ll find out soon enough though. 
---
Fist is definitely good. Cataclysm builds with it might even be better than the "aggro" version.
---
NA Eclipso #11988
---
&gt; No, they're never premiered on their livestreams, it's always YouTube since that's where they can be preserved, found easily (and monetised)
---
Nonono, I mean they play the reveal video during a Twitch livestream, while also making the YouTube video itself public, this has happened multiples times in the past
---
well it's not like we play that many mechs in our current CW builds anyway right? i can slot 2 of those badboys if i m not playing odd warrior(which obviusly won't be a thing anymore) no need to be a full mech or full dragon war. A simple control warrior, with his tool to stall and some threat
---
NA? 
---
fact is that it would be shit if you need to play him before turn 10, this way it's a yeti if you need him in turn 4-9.
---
probably should ve been a 4-4 tho.
---
If you have to ask that question probably packs unless you have no interest in ladder
---
Keep in mind that there's gonna be 2 more pay to play adventures this year

---
people said the same thing about kalaseth or the hand buff warlock card that is played in zoo.
---
yes, its a situation card.  but when "the nuts" is game winning it pushes your average win rate up, which is the objective of every card.
---
Sure, I think that happens for some of them. 
---
My main point is really that it should never link to their twitch if they have an active YouTube channel. Check your past posts, they've always been linked to their YouTube, since that's where they want people to go.
---
Maybe it's different this time, but it may just be a mistake too. I'll try to find out if it is..
---
That being said, some of the classes could certainly use a new one in addition to the available currently
---
Warrior, Hunter haven't gotten one since 2015, Mage hasn't gotten one since 2016, Rogue hasn't gotten one since 2017
---
The rest are all pretty recent
---
Also Knife Juggler, Imp Rally, Bloodtroll Zapper. I'd say that's not enough yet. But we don't know that many cards from the new expansion by now, so let's see.. 
---
I mean... I've ignored the dragon package entirely and am doing just fine with a mech odd taunt package. The problem I see with this, though, is we'll need to widen our endgame package. For one of the current decks, our endgame is fatigue and Baku at the top end because it has to be there. For the other, we use taunts as a midrange tool and have a 1-drop and Baku as our endgame. We need to widen that out to at least five big threats, the best we can get, and that in turn will put one hell of a pinch on what we can have in the middle. It'll be hard.
---
Oh i didnt know that! Packs it is then. Thanks
---
Go cry in a corner 
---
I may be making a false assumption here, but if your main reason for wanting to go to a Fireside is to get Nemsy, go ahead and get it on EU. It'll become available on NA as well once you have it.
---
If that isn't the reason, good luck with your search!
---
Done
---
What deck did you play? I have been trying to climb a lot this week but the RNGesus hasn’t been in my favor
---
Priest going for fatigue? What year is this?
---
yes ! (It's the taurissan brawl...)
---
 i think they should make golden cards have a small bonus or something so it's worth getting. I think +1 attack or -1 less mana to cast or something
---
my boss still does this to us on a regular basis.
---
&gt; Literally the turn after he does this my deck has a seizure
---
I lol'd a this, my decks often have those mental problems from time to time. on a more serious note, you have to have in mind that if you play a deck with a low curve you are open to bad draws, if you keep getting good draws on a low curve deck is more that you were lucky on the draws than anything else.
---
This is why I think this is stronger than crowd roaster. It's worse on turn 7, 8 and 9, but you can use it to contest an early board against aggro in a way that Crowd Roaster cannot.
---
That card might not be as bad as people think it is. It needs to be considered that 3 sets are rotating out which will lead to a lower powerlevel overall. So while this would probably not be played in the keleseth heal zoo, it could have a good place in the zoo version that recently saw some play including grim rally, scarab egg and knife juggler.
---
Some synergy cards do exist by now (Knife Juggler, Grim Rally, Spirit of the bat, Bloodtroll Zapper, Demonbolt) and some might come in the new expansion yet...
---
Keep in mind that with the Death Knights rotating, Dr. Boom will be a lot more powerful as a late-game value engine and can be a win condition on its own.
---
You were saying?
---
&gt; Hearthstone is a game where everything is accessible to anyone
---
wat.. Today I learned, packs don't cost a lot of time and/or money.
---
it already does, if you have a all golden deck you blind your opponent and they cant play the game no more
---
You don't think that this specific thing couldn't be replaced by hundreds of other stupid kid things?
---
I mostly climb to 5 instead of legend but if RNGesus hates you it's often better to play a deck that has very few autoloss matchups. Something like control warrior is super polarized, but Myracle rogue has a good chance against most of the field. If there are a ton of Warriors on the ladder, there'll be a ton of combo decks too, so a non-polarized deck is likely to do better against the 2.
---
Or aggro, aggro is always good.
---
This deck is just... EVIL
---
I THINK I'LL TAKE IT
---
so it's a random lackey or a discover effect?
---
But it's an almost insta-keep for the mulligan. More so than others. In Zoolock decks, you'd keep this, then by turn 5 you've got summon 5 5/5s. I fail to see how this is bad
---
It definitely helps against aggro.
---
Indeed. hahaha along with the other cards too!
---
Now who downvoted me?!
---
So yeah my point was it must have been in advance 
---
Also combine this with a grim rally on a 1 cost minion and you've got a pretty intimidating board 
---
I wonder if someone could compile a full pro con list of notable spells for yog in wild and their impact on the game to go off for free.
---
The worst cards to go off would be:Cataclysm, Myra's Unstable Element, Astral Communion, Psychic scream, Treachery, 
---
Some of the better ones: Gloops Glorious Gloop, Zerek's Cloning Gallery, Luna's Pocket Galaxy, The Storm Bringer, Void Contract, Call of the wild, fill your board with secrets,
---
Other notable: Boomship, Ultimate infestation, Tree of life, Doom
---
High chances of just clearing the board, summoning random minions, drawing a tooooon of cards and dealing a bunch of damage to either player. Honestly, I think he belongs to be unnerfed either way. He fits that archtype that pretty much needs a deck belt around him to survive and with how many decks kill you turn 5 or have infinite generation, I think a coin flip otk would not be able too frustrating to see and players may be more willing to play against it if there is a fairly equal chance for it to ruin both players and would truly feel like a chaos deck.  
---
Still looking for double trade have chalange with friend quest eu rifathemage #2465
---
I hardly ever get abuse in game. It's so unfair. I'm up for in-game chat or voice comms with your opponent just for the laughs.
---
The last time I did get abuse was when I beat a Big Priest in Wild with a meme Priest deck that had a nice Prince Malechazzar and Princess Tilanji combo. When big minions were dropped I entombed them. And the 2 Shadow Essence plays both got Barnes. Poor sod.
---
I thought they wanted to see my ridiculous deck's code. But they were incensed at by BM play :)
---
Yes. And everyone has time. There is nothing preventing you from getting a card. There is no card not accessible. 
---
This wouldn’t be ironhide though. It would be a 1 mana gain 10-20, depending on the match up. That leaves 9 more mana to make plays. 
---

I play an average of 10 games a day and win on average 7-8 of them in the current ranked season I'm rank 11 and have only played like 34 games so maybe I don't play that much. 
---
Yup, exactly! Too bad illidan has such a bad card in hearthstone
---
While I would like the secret to come back I don't think they would, no in the first set of a year anyway as you would have to dedicate multiple Rogue card slots to at least 3 secrets to have the secret to remain "secret." I'd be down for a new spellstone for sure as the one we got I was confused by when it released as well. Deathrattle was not what I was thinking the activator would be and this time around I would hope the activator would be more geared toward what Rogue likes to do now, Burgle effects. Upgrades when you play 2 cards not from your class.
---
And you milled them, so they didn't cycle. That interaction always felt lame to me.
---
Be careful on which cards to craft. For example, gentle Megasaur is an expensive card but it won't be playable in the normal gamemode come April. The card sets that will be rotating out are Ungoro, Knights of the Frozen Throne and Kobolds&amp;Catacombs. 
---
That obviously means it's gonna be the best one 
---
Yea I guess. Im Not f2p so I don't mind it too much. It still kinda feels bad

thanks!
---
Losing bood razor hurts a little but we have brawl, war path, supercollider, emberscale drake, smolderthorn lancer, execute, devastate, shield block, zilliax, armorsmith, shield slam, etc. Control warrior is going to be just fine getting to turn 10 most of the time.
---
This would insta lose against my very annoying freeze mage deck.
---
Always a "Hello" to start and a "Well Played" to end. An "Oops" if either one of us makes a bone-headed mistake. "Wow" if my opponent does something genuinely amazing or if I get amazingly unlucky. I'll only "Threaten" as a reply to an opponents threat or if it's genuinely amusing when conceding ("Your soul shall suffer!"). I use "Thank You" exclusively for Priest-on-Priest Turn 2 heals.
---

---
It's funny you say that, but in the very early days (pre-Naxx) I'd play a golden card that had taunt and some players would get confused and think it wasn't a taunt card because it looked different. Always happy to provide an instructive lesson when it involves me getting an easy win.
---
I agree,  I have a vast amount of the polarity winrates memorized and I use that knowledge to enforce my ability to not be salty when I lose to Aj odd paladin with deathrattle hunter and what not. 
---
Oooh, they updated the schedule a little then, nice
---
It’s about sending a message!
---
I often find that when I'm winning, but it was a fun game and I want to be friendly to my opponent. But I *can't* emote well-played before he does, because I don't want to risk him or her interpreting it as a BM "offensive gg."
---
I'll do it if I'm in the mood. But if I have a good run out and it's a one sided victory for me I don't. I could see it being taken sarcastically in that context.
---
I want to see sir Finkley coming back again
---
I’d like to see some more minion in hand manipulation like I wish they printed a card that silences a random enemy minion while they are still your opponents hand, so a card like leeroy just becomes a 6/2 without charge.

I had thought of zihi but it's not too great with my deck as it stops me from playing my late game which is when I start to take the board, my early game is all stall unfortunately.

I don't think it matters one way or the other. Lots of people enjoy "saving the last hit" with the highest attack which rocks the board for dramatic effect.

Rush and mech will synergize. Rush package + dynomatic, Zilliax, Boom, and Omega assembly. Nother has enough to stand on its own, they need to combine to make a real deck.
---
Dragon warrior will be it’s own thing.
---
I understand &amp; you're completely right with people changing a positive message into something negative. But as I mentioned - I choose to see it as someone being nice.  
---
I have fun playing hearthstone.  If I were to take it negatively i'd stop enjoying the community.
---
Ya. That’s the exact thing I want lol.
---
Yeah but the difference is that you can do something on zihi turns and they cannot, like what i said, build board they cant remove, zihi then go face
---
I’m sure Gul’dan doesn’t feel bad for dusting Varian
---
Not if they are odd paladin or some lame mechathun deck. But generally, yes. 
---
Radiant elementals and buffs allow you to snowball your board together with questing adventurers.  You wanna keep pyromancer against aggro and just continually clear their board until they run out of steam. If they're control or combo just  focus on drawing + buffing + getting Lyra value. Depending on what you play against you can choose what you wanna seance. Against aggro you typically seance a pyromancer, while against control you can seance a grave horror. I've only played like 17 games with the deck so i'm not sure about the matchups but it definitely felt like it had polarizing matchups. Basically the deck revolves around big swing-turns where you get a lot of value from your cheap spells.
---
It has been my favorite feature recently. I have so many and it is great to finally be able to utilize all of them without having to manually change it. 
---
Leeroy...
---
And can't remember the last one. Gonna feel hella stupid when someone posts it here.
---
Leeroy and Alakir.
---
Leeroy and Al'Akir.
---
It only gives 3 random after a clear the first time. After a failed run it gives 1 random, the shrine you lost with and the shrine you lost to
---
I start with a "Greetings" and end with a "Well played."
---
Legend has it that Blizzard realized Paladin is so dead after all his good cards and his divine favour rotates out, that they are letting him just disappear as a class. There will be no more Paladin cards ever, just play him in wild. That's probably why they've released cards for every class except him.
---
To me it means "I won, but you played well, good game." 
---
I feel like to some degree this is better than chemleos (sp) and other degrees worse. 
---
Please don’t downvote me if I’m totally wrong lol
---
Doesn't die to Hemet tho
---
It's a dead draw which almost completely kills the card. It's surprisingly hurtful for its viability.
---
I think it's the best type of effect in that it gives you information that might change how you play the game. It's not an "i win button" but tests the pilot's skill in playing around what they know could happen.
---
I just think they both have some different utility, not that you replace one with the other.
---
And I feel you're underselling the value of Cham. I've used it more as an information gatherer and a potential combo disrupter/oh shit button if something like that pops up. This card will be nice to have a body, give info, and generate a card but that's a one time burst. Info is valuable throughout the whole match IMO.
---
By waiting 3+ turns.
---
This is stronger then Chameleos which never saw play because it can "lock in" your choice.  If you choose Twisting Nether, you don't need to wait and hope you roll it on T8, you get it.
---
I think this is good, playable, but not insane.  You need other cards to build around it in a good, slow, control style deck.  The stat line is anti-tempo as well.  It's not like Drakanoid Operative that pulled from your deck (slightly worse), had a premium tag (dragon), and a great statline
---
With chameleos you could see more cards in the span of multiple turns but the card you could play was random.With this you get the information right away and you can keep the card you value the most and use it for later turns.Personally I like this one more
---
cards like this further solidify my opinion that Blizzard is trying to curb some of the crazier over the top of effects to help better balance the game. Has the potential to be powerful but in no way game breaking/deciding
---
but it only lets you see  three if you keep it in your hand for a minimum of 3 turns (you can get the same cards).  keeping a dead card in your hand for 3 turns is much worse than a card that does it  immediately and gives you a body.
---
I'm surprised Griftah isn't on this list. 
---
I genuinely think that you should be granted at least 1 golden pack every expansion for this accomplishment (not just you, but everyone who completes this)
---
Could absolutely win the game in some instances. Imagine pulling a quest reward in wild, Mal'Ganis, or even just playing around a win condition they have in their hand.
---
Dr. OP effect on a Legendary card, with lower stats but no condition AND comes from hand instead of deck? Seems very strong imo.
---
this card gives  Chameleos vibes. Chameleos  was not a good card this card is slower but a better top deck. The reason it's slower is because in  Chameleos case you can get a card and play it immediately. that being said you can save cards in Lazul so unlike Chameleos if you get a card that you can't play now but play later in  Chameleos case you would have to wait and hope you get it again not the same with Lazul.Also Chameleos was bad because most priest decks wanted to kill you and not out-value you after the rotation value cards like Chameleos and Lazul might be core cards for control priest.
---
Perhaps, but to his greater point, once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, and celebrating the release of retrained versions of earlier designs "always" being in Standard despite the biyearly releases is rather odd.
---
It would probably be better as a 2/3 for aggro. A 3/2 for 3 against a good aggro deck is aggressively bad.
---
Dr 5. is better than this.  
---

He called me many bad names and unfriended me before I could respond. Oh well.

I hope you seek some help for that temper and proclivity for victimhood, buddy.

Sure, but that's in the way every single card can be gamewinning, or at least every single card generating card.

If opponent's hand is empty, I assume nothing happens.

What if they have &lt; 3 cards in their hand? Do you discover from fewer choices?

If I see 2x of a card during the discover does that mean they have 2x copies in hand? Is it possible for the discover to even show the same card twice? In fact, it's possible they could have 3x+ copies of the same card in hand. Will the discover just show the same choice in all three slots?

Nah, just spam it until you have enough dust to build good decks and then completely ignore the decks you built and keep playing cheap aggro hunter decks because you want to watch the world burn

[[Hemet, Jungle Hunter]]
---
At rank 5 or higher there's no such thing as "Well played", you either draw cards in good order or your opponent.
---
If you don't draw better cards than your opponent and getting totally destroyed without a chance to retaliate, "Well played" sounds very much out of place.
---
Also don't ever use emotes more than once in a short period of time. At that point you're just trying to be annoying without sending any message.
---
Ice Cream Peddler was used in that troll Shudderwock deck.

yeah this is kind of messy from a design standpoint. Maybe they’ll lampshade it so if you play lazul while playing *as* lazul she triggers an extra voiceline

I thought this was odd too. I guess with Shaman having a Hagatha Hero card and now a minion (And a 99% chance warrior has the same with Dr. Boom)  they decided it wouldn't be a big deal

Is this the first discover card that might give you 2, 1 or 0 choices, when your opponent has less than 3 cards in hand or is there any other discover card not always giving 3 options?
---
This seems boring for a legendary. Although maybe playing with death knights the past two years has ruined things.
---

---
I mean.. is it really? meta is super stale right now and you can literally predict any deck you face these days. This card puts a body on board right away and a free card of your choice depending on the situation. Body + free card is always going to be better than rng cham just sitting in your hand
---
damn son, this is one hell of a strong card
---
It's not a gamewinning card, but of course it can win you games, but pretty much every card can.  
---
Maybe it would have been better if I said win condition, but that's not exactly what I meant though it may be closer to what I meant.
---
Okay sure for a good player. This is my first time being this high.

#FINALLY PREIST GETS A GOOD LEGENDARY!!! YEAR OF THE PRIEST!!!! YESS!!!!

The most valuable component here is that you get to see three cards in your opponents hand for 3 mana, and pick the best one.  Plus a decent stat 3 drop means it never is a bad play.  This card is an auto include.  Turn 3 can be an awkward turn for a lot of decks, developing a 3-2 and seeing half your opponents opening hand is a strong play.  Picking the best of those 3 cards to hold in hand is even stronger.
---
Late game it could tell you your opponents entire hand, pick up a clutch clear, and reveal a lethal strategy you did not anticipate.
---
This card is 5 stars.
---
Oh, I am stupid, sorry.
---
Yes. You've figured it out and now you're playing a game you can't lose but your opponent is willing to play it out, takes his time on every turn and you have to sit there and play a pointless game through 10 time outs. That seems like a lot of fun
---

As long as it was a battlecry on a somewhat expensive minion and not a start of game effect, it would be totally fine. 
---
3 mana 3/2 is not ok stats :D Especially against aggro.
---
Yea that’s true. But with tar creeper and stonehill defender gone, it’ll probably either be this or omega medic on 3 or nothing.

6/6/3 | Battlecry: Replace your starting Hero Power with a better one.  
---
Forgive me. I have failed.
---
As far as i know, "gg" just means "good game", so nothing offensive/harmful. 
---
&gt;Do as you wish, but in most cases it would be considered BM. Unless the game was actually good or fun.
---
But then again, considering it as BM is also "doing as you wish". How is it my fault that someone considers it BM? Whether the game was good or fun is also subjective, so who is supposed to judge that?
---
This could lead to winning the game in some specific circumstances, but I think what was meant here is that it's not a win condition of the deck it's placed into, in the way, say, Malygos or Leeroy might be.
---
Not much of the dalaran defender class cards have been revealed, so I wouldnt jump to any conclusions. Theres only 1 druid and mage card right now.

So basically you’re just discounting my side of the argument entirely.

You will get flamed because you refuse to just hedge your bets and not be a dick online and you’d better not cry about it here.

---
Yeah, that's what happens when you take deck winrates at face value. Doesn't mean it's automatically a class ranking from best to worst. Priest is not an intuitive class. Priest winrates will always be lower.
---
Only good if Priest gets another archetype that’s not OTK.

I don’t take the meaning of ‘Well Played’ too literally. To me it is more gg or ‘thanks for the game’. It matters little whether someone played well or badly, or if the game was one-sided. I think it’s polite to acknowledge you’ve spent time with someone playing a computer game.  
---
The exceptions are Jaina and Anduin, they don’t deserve my Well Played. /s
---
I think that’s what he’s trying to say. People hyped up Chameleos a *ton* when it was teased with similar things to what’s being said in this thread. Granted, this card seems to solve some of Chameleos’ weaknesses, but I think it’s still being overhyped.

The thing that kind of surprises me is Ice Cream Peddler being dead last - Booty Bay Bookie I completely understand, but I distinctly recall Disguised Toast doing a meme deck with Ice Cream, freeze cards, and Sudderwock to gain like seven billion armor.

... Although now I realize: The nerf to Chain Gang made the combo impossible to do in standard, and this is post-that nerf data from Standard decks only. So, I guess it makes more sense.

---
Why would you ever build around this? What would your win con be? I don't even see how this fits into any current priest deck. I could see moments it would be helpful, but not crazy impactful. Maybe I'm not thinking of scenarios where this can consistently decide a game.
---
It's almost like stats are important in HS.
---
Besides the Spellstone, nothing of it is really important.
---
Psychic Scream can be replaced by next upcoming board-clear.
---
Lich King can be replaced by another big minion/Ysera.
---
Anduin wasn't a must-have for Gallery Priest in first place.
---
Lyra was nice, but not important.
---
All those minions/cards are at best as important as Zilliax.
---
Only lack of Spellstone kills the deck.
---
Discovering your opponent's hand is much much better than deck though. Their hand should have better cards for the situation than their deck, it gives you information, and it's much better than Chameleos. Chameleos sucked because it did nothing. This pretty strictly doesn't, and discovering is obviously much better than turning into a new card every turn. 
---
You don't have to play this on curve, though. In fact, it's better not to against non tempo and aggro match ups. Against control, you have to call it, but you wait until you snipe an important card. It's more flexible than Drak in a lot of ways, unconditional, and a 3/2 isn't the worst for slower decks on turn 3, though is its weakest point. 
---
Acting hurt? Seems ti be what youre doing.  I'm not the one here who is taking issues with an emote in a game that's the equivalent of saying good game.  I'm sure some people are offended when someone says "wow" or "oops" but that doesn't mean it's always bm just because of the possibility us it can be seen that way.  
---
You should stop assuming everyone who says it is trying to insult you.  I'm not going to stop telling my opponent I think they played a good game when I assume the majority of people I play against will either appreciate it or at the very least aren't so pathetic they would be bothered by a little emote.  I don't need to stop myself from saying gg because someone here or there will take it way too personally. 
---
OP was also a dragon enabler so that was huge. 
---
This is a good card but will have to contest in a list of 30 cards. I see being flexible against all speeds of decks but not sure how it fits into the decks we have now.
---
It doesn’t accelerate combo. It doesn’t control the board if you’re just grabbing a weenie. It’s not a dragon or taunt so it just dilutes the game plan or res pool. 
---
A light at the end of this tunnel is that it’s good if you’re playing a high value deck and with hero cards going away, that might be a thing soon. It’ll curb Aggro until you draw removal and gives you minions to play. It’ll copy a high value card from control and force some removal. 
---
Clever girl 
---
nope Priest has been strong, Chameleos is just bad
---
When you start picking apart examples used to demonstrate the concept instead of addressing the concept itself, (and personally attacking the commenter!) you’ve already lost the argument. 
---
It's a terrible top deck, needs to sit in your hand for a while and you need at least one more card to make it actually useful. I think you're overestimating it. 
---
That makes me think of [[blood to ichor]] but I guess that functioned a lot more differently than BBB does.

you seen like a sore loser not gonna lie
---
Yeah that's very fair. I still feel like this will be an incredibly average card. Even though it's discover, it's still going to have a ton of rng around it. Wouldn't be surprised if it makes it in a chunk of priest decks moving forward, but not crazy by any means.
---
Hand is more powerful as it lets you play around threats
---

I have actually played only one game of RR because I hardly dislike to be forced to play a random class. Also the lack of rewards support my dislike against the game mode.

Does Kibler get one? And is it notable that Firebat and Dog don't get one or has that been normal?
---
Garbage, [[Crystallizer]] would be played instead.  It's a toss-up to say whether a 1/3 statline is better than a 2/2 statline, that part could go either way.
---
But then when you say that the 2/2 gives the enemy a coin and the 1/3 doesn't?  The 1/3 is now the vastly superior card.
---
If you consider a vanilla 3 mana 3/4 to be fair,  you're sacrificing 2 health for a card and knowing up to 3 cards in your opponent's hand. I think that's pretty good.

the important part is you ''know'' what 3 cards your opponent is holding.
---
There is a workaround. Either use hearthstone deck tracker which can track battletag easily, or add them , then go the view send friend request option to see the full battletag.
---
After that, go to blizzard website to report it.
---
I think hs is the only or the few of blizzard games which don't have a built in report function for botting/threats.
---
It's truly a casual game.
---
Dr. Boomhammer
---
I mean, it was played in many priest decks regardless of the fact that the card gained was, as you put it, "likely of little use". Madame Lazul trades 1 random card from your opponent's decks with a choice of 3 from their hand. Not only does it give you information but in certain matchups it can give you a copy of your opponent's winning condition - say, for example, the new Rafaam legendary. 
---
If they have all on the board at turn 3 thats no problem, just ban that +2 attack to all mechs dude and they cant do anything after that. But if they‘re plaing the monkey with „discover a mech“ too im lost
---
I wonder if sarcasm doesn't translate well.
---
Battlecry: I'm Groot, I'm Groot Deathrattle: I'm Groot
---
Certainly does, yeah: Blood to Ichor requires a minion on the board, so you can only really use it as a turn one tempo swing if you go second, and even then, if your opponent plays nothing or a 1 health minion, no slime for you.
---
Even if you get a 3/2 body with the effect, this would only be beneficial if Priest gets some kind of midrange archetype. 
---
However if Priest still needs to OTK people to win games, this card probably doesn’t make the cut, since it doesn’t reliably helps you staying alive, or gets along with the OTK gameplan.
---
He played it today and silenced himself as first (and last) spell.
---
Cabal Shadow Priest interaction is literally the one interaction people are considering this card for, not sure if you even read the stuff or watched the video....
---
This is basically a non-dragon version of [[Twilight Acolyte]], where you exchange the dragon requirement for a "hold in hand ?? turns requirement"
---
You can bot though, and there is one frequent user here who have been botting a lot and escaping blizzard banwave(3 or 4 year plus)
---
rank 3 is my highest ever and i stopped pushing for legend after 2 months of rank5 floor. i was able to get up to rank 3 quick enough so i thought i would finally hit legend and after 2 weeks of roller coaster rides to rank 5 floor i decided i would rather just play arena or meme decks. goodbye grinding ladder matches hello salty opponents and legendary memes. 
---
To me, it seems like a great Epic Card. I think it would be cool if you could steal the card. That would make it Legendary level, but I would also think it should be a hire mana cast for that effect since there usually needs to be some sort of trade off for legendary cards
---
Coincidentally, Booty Bay Bookie could also be used to mill your opponent.
---
Oh that's true. I somehow never realized that Rafaam is ethereal. Maybe because of the eyes.
---
Agreed. I'm not that confident that being able to read 3 cards from your opponent's hand is worth the crappy stats. 
---
And getting a card from their hand is a lot worse than from their deck;
---
From their deck, you can get all the big cards that are good to everyone (lich king, etc). 
---
But from their hand, on turn 3, you'll get a lot of early game trash that won't be as good for you as it is for them, and synergy stuff.
---
We don't know what that meta will look like post-rotation, but compare this to the current meta, what the most played decks have in hand on turn 3... Most of it is complete trash that wouldn't help priest at all.
---
I mean sure if their mulligan whiffs and they get a 8 drop that's fine, but generally, on turn 3 most of their hand will be low level stuff, and while it's great for them, it won't be great for the priest.
---
Still, I'll the team the benefit of the doubt that they somewhat tested it... The fact that they made it a 3-2 (and not a 3-3, like the usual 3 mana 'draw' 1) makes me think they tried it and found out it was a tad too strong, and had to nerf the usual statline. 
---
So maybe it really is good.

It seems all the villains are going to be arena OP.

I do the opposite, I dust the golden wild cards because I generally wont see much play with them going forward, and they give a nice dust boost while still letting me retain non-goldens for play.
---
Honestly I don't even think it's that bad of  a card. Sure the coin would hurt and zoo isn't really popular but I wonder if with rotation it might become a staple in agro.
---
I don't think so. Arcane Intellect gives you card advantage, you lose a card to get two cards. 
---
Lazul gives you information and value, losing a card to get another one is not an advantage of any sort.
---

---
I like your attitude (and your comment), a lot!
---
Gave me a good laugh.
---
Yeah, but you could also steal hunters marks, unleash the hounds, tracking, flanking strike, or DK Rexxar. Hunters almost always keep DK Rexxar and stealing him can win you the match (although this is irrelevant in standard because the death knights are rotating out).
---
The card is definitely weak against aggro decks, but most decks that aren't purely about minion vomit will generally have some pretty great cards to steal.
---
Yeah I do this all the time. I was just working on finishing the KFT solo adventure and I instinctively emoted “well played” after I won before realizing that I’m an idiot for talking to the AI. 
---
Ice cream peddler is such booty cheeks lmaooo
---
Unless they can't see that one as the 4th card, in which case you have pogo hopper so you win anyway
---
Why would I waste my time doing that? 
---
Case in point 
---
&gt; In early builds of the Rumble Run, we allowed players to pick a class and shrine before playing. What we found was that playtesters immediately picked their favorite class, gravitated to a certain shrine, and played that shrine repeatedly.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; We had wanted to **encourage** players to try different shrines, 
---
So playtesters had a way they played that they enjoyed, and blizzard blocked that way of playing completely.
---
It's "You think you want it but you don't" all over again.
---
I know if i could actually choose the class and shrine i played, I'd play it - at least a bit. Now, I cleared it once and you can't bribe me with classic packs to play it again. I swap that quest every time, which I never did with witchwood or dungeon run.
---
There is a slight difference in the rate. It's the rounded percentage that is the same.
---
Without Oracle, stonehill and bonedrake it's going to need more support to be better than it is now
---
So, it's Discover+Mind Visions on a minion. Neither Mind Visions nor Chameleos saw much play, but this being a discover might help quite a bit. It still has the same problem, being a dead card, if your opponent has no hand, potentially being risky, if the opponent plays highly synergistic cards et., though. Potentially interesting with Talanji and as a card scouting your opponent's deck, if we end up with rather similar deckbuilds again, like peak Druid or such. I don't quite expect Thief Priest to become a competitive thing, yet, and don't quite see this card being good enough in regular Control. Could change with more support cards, obviously.
---
just another reason to instantly concede every fucking time i get paired with a priest! save us both the time!

I like hunter decks that you have options with. Not aggro play everything in my hand
---
because they often forget how tight the deck lists are. you have 30 cards in a deck but there are like 60 cool useful cards that "can be put in any deck!" which they almost never do. because you need to include that one card that increases your chances against aggro like 3% instead of that cool card that gives you info...

---

---
I know you're probably already through with this draft, but when dealt a tough choice, try put it into terms like:  
---
Tirion is, theoretically, a 5-for-1 play. (2 minion kills with Divine Shield and afterwards, 3 with Ashbringer). For only 8 mana, and having immediate impact on the board with being a threatening taunt, he should almost always be the pick.
---
It's not a big issue for me; I was just wondering, that's all.
---
How many decks are running worthless cards? Unless you're up against a weird combo warlock you've got a pretty good chance of hitting something decent. On top of that you get to see three cards in their hand and plan you're next turns accordingly. This card is going to see a ton of play.

That's the way it works. Previously, Blizzard had patched Tess' battlecry to end if she left the battlefield. But the community didn't like that, and there was a lot of vocal criticism. Eventually, in a later patch, they made it so Tess' battlecry would continue even if she left the field.
---
In the current case, what happened is the only intuitive solution. What happens when Yogg casts Treachery on itself? It casts the remainder of its battlecry for your opponent, instead of for you. Its the same principle being applied here. If Tess ends up in the opponent's deck after Psychic Screaming herself, then the opponent now has ownership of her, albeit in the deck. So the rest of her battlecry applies for the opponent.
---
it's not a free effect if you have to play a 3 mana 3/2 to get the effect. playing a 3 mana 3/2 is garbo
---
Actually it won't tell you most of that. If they have 7 cards, you can't know what they don't have based on seeing three of them once.

---
I always well play and usually greeting
---
You say that like the cards aren't ridiculously stupid. Really? You get to draw as many cards as i have? hell even if they cut it down to half that'd still be a bit much. 
---
&gt;But Hearthstone is a tempo game, not value. 
---
I think I agree, but I'm not sure how the effect of hand knowledge applies to either. Which got me to wondering about this... Just how different would games play out if hands were played face up? Turn to turn decisions would change, absolutely. But how much would the endings change? Sure, you wouldn't want to flood a board knowing a Twisting Nether is waiting, but given many deck compositions do you have much choice? Or would trying to play around it effectively lose the game for an aggro deck all the same, except the warlock wouldn't even have to spend 8 mana to stop the rush, therefore incentivizing the aggro to keep pushing and remove the threat of board clear on later turns? 
---
Nice
---
Well, 100% was a bit to optimistic, but i won my first 8 brawls! Just try it!
---
It 100% is, but even when they ban that I run free fireplumes and buff and get free elementals plus evolution
---
Thanks is BM, there's situation where you would use that... We need Sorry back, for those times where I AFK the mulligans
---
maybe just down vote things ya don't like
---
Haha, they probably read this post 😆
---
"What career?!"
---
I’ve been playing since closed beta and today i got my first gold hero lol! I’m mostly arena and took a break for 2 years so that should be considered i suppose🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Pack fillerrrrrr

I'm addicted to you.

I hope that's her line when she's played
---
But that doesn't work because you know what class your facing before Bakus effect takes place, so you'd first see its Shaman, then you'd realize it's Odd Shaman.

It's not free. It costs 1 card. Never forget that card you have to spend. It's an extremely important ressource.
---
You know what else costs 1 card and zero mana? wisp. Which is better than waterboy because, only losing a single stat, you get rid of the horrible requirement of having to hero power.
---
YOUUUUUUU AREENOT PREEE- shit
---
Seems comparable to Chameleos but how much play did he see? Lazul seems kinda underwhelming to me.
---
No. It’s good turn 1 but bad after that.
---
Not saying Crowley isn't better (he is), but Hogger isn't even bad in arena. Drop him on an empty/winning board and your winrate increases significantely.
---
Yea but you can get back all your dust anyway
---
It just occurred to me that the "aside" in DR op's attack voice line might, among other reasons, refer to the fact that it discovers cards from the opponent's deck which is on the side.   
---
Will one of the voice lines for Lazul contain the word "ahead"? Not terribly unlikely if she's a fortune teller, and she's discovering cards from opponent's hand which is positioned right ahead.
---
does this upgrade the imp stat or the number of imps?
---
Wish I could make a functional Gnoll deck for hearthstone, that would be cool.
---
-Maiev, on how to deal with illidan for 10000 years
---
I dust my Standard cards after rotation. :/ Am I doing it wrong?
---
Not auto include in big priest 
---
Do you actually play Magma Rager in that Deck? Or......
---
Thank you for sharing. It was a great nostolgia trip
---
but OP was simply an overpowered minion to push dragon priest . this card is much more balanced imo.
---
OP was just nuts
---
This isn't like Curious Glimeroot where you might whiff. You get to see 3 cards that are FOR SURE in your opponents hand. So, not only do you know they included them in their deck but they're actually in their hand and you get to choose one with no downside. Side bonus is that you put a body on the board at the same time. This is much better than Chameleos.
---
Fair enough 
---
&gt; **thug priest** 
---
Thief Priest? Thug priest has got to be one of the worst connotations I've ever heard applied within Hearthstone. Please stop saying that. It sounds ridiculous. 
---
I did about 2 years ago and only just now caught up recollecting them
---
yes, but sometimes I misclick and say “thank you” and I feel *REALLY* bad about it
---
**Naxx is out?**
---
Ban mana wraith and wait for a chance to fill your board with enough power to kill the doomsayers or your opponent. Your deck doesn’t seem to have healing so just two full boards is enough 
---
The average card from any Discover effect is also very good. If the meta following this set is combo or synergy focused than you’re actually less likely to get a good card from Lazul because it might just be trash with your deck. 
---
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhh   **Y E S**
---
Tar Creeper - the Tar just flows and flows and it's beautiful... I can't bear to disenchant it.
---
Thank you. It's just general manners. I'm not stopping doing something considered sportsmanlike in basically any other online game just because there are some people who are too insecure about a casual game to see that someone isn't making fun of them. 
---
Or just be magic where there are some complex rules but standard is fairly streamlined with a straightforward concept/mechanics. YGO just shits on brevity.
---
I feel like this is objectively worse than glimmer.  It's stated worse and you only get options from their hand and not their full deck. It'll depend on where the meta goes, but I feel like this wouldn't have a place in the current meta, just like chameleos.
---
I feel like this will play really well with chameleos though, they have pretty obvious synergy with each other and I think they elevate each other's value.
---
Well, no one is CRAFTING the ice cream peddler, so I'm not 100% surprised... it is purple after all.
---
Actually played against that card recently. My opponent had it in a Shudderwock deck, combined with Glacial Shard. Interesting insurance kind of card... making sure that once you've played Shudderwock, you've basically won.
---
Also, fuck Shudderwock. I love and continue to love Yogg, but Shudderwock can shuck a dick. What a not fun card to play against.
---
Yep that’s exactly my thought process. Really just depends on the meta. 
---
We've got 3 this set already, so I reckon it's a mystery...
---
Well, unless the Lackeys are Pendulum Monsters that were already destroyed and sent to the extra deck, the effect is wrong. You can't add Extra Deck cards to your hand. You can make this card much simpler:
---
"When summoned, search for one of each copy of a "Lackey" monster in your deck. Your opponent pick 2 of them, at random"
---
This is more accurate and follow other cards format.

Happy Cake Day!
---
This has been happening to me for weeks, I don't know what triggers it but it's not every time a treant is played. 
---
I think it’s a certain kind of treant
---
Maybe you are just dumb and are projecting yourself onto others. 
---
Actually, I'd kinda like to see a revival of "If you have a mech" as was first introduced in GvG. It's been a while, and would mesh well with a lot of the Mechs introduced in Boomsday.
---
It’s not all treants, cuz later he summoned more but a different kind and it was fine 
---
I got up to 8/8 golem but a 13/2 spirit with cold blooded
---
I'm sure it will come out in the story but she runs an underground slave trade and narcotics smuggling ring in Azeroth.  She just takes on the appearance of an innocent fortune teller, with bad fashion sense, to throw off suspicion.

&gt; Master Rule 4
---
You're not kidding, I looked it up and the 'link' mechanic really seems to have completely changed the game, as well as Pendulum Monsters.
---
Good to know!
---
I agree mostly, but imagine that on turn 8 you see the hunter has only three cards in hand, you play this card and see that there is no KC. Now, instead of making the choice to heal out of KC range you can elect to use that mana to build a more threatening board instead of playing around a threat that your opponent doesn't have - ie instead of playing sub-optimally given the potential information available.
---
Definitely not the most powerful thing ever, but knowing when an opponent does/doesn't have lethal (vs when they *might* have lethal) means that plays which would be bad in an uncertain environment become good.
---
Yugioh isn't a computer card game. People have to do all of the mechanics themselves.
---
Same. And I use "wow" a lot too. When the opponent makes a great play. When the opponent gets screwed by RNG. When I get screwed by RNG. 
---
I played some crazy Ice Lance mage it Tavern Brawl last night while I was sitting at the bar. She hit me with seven of them in a row and milled most of my deck while she was at it. I was laughing so hard that the lady next to me asked me what was wrong. Unfortunately for the cheeky mage, she couldn't find the last one, so I ended up winning. We both emoted "wow" while it was happening, and both said "well played" at the end. I ended up adding her to my friends list.
---
Yeah it'll be pretty good in Arena but I can't see this being played in Constructed. Perhaps it'll find a spot in decks since Priest's early game is so bad anyways.
---
Wasn't this in one of the puzzles?
---
You’re not missing much. I enjoyed it as a kid with friends, but nowadays if you can’t win on turn 1 your deck is garbage
---
But you spend 3 mana doing that, and also chameleos has already shown its not that great.
---
Further you describe a super specific scenario... cards that are good are good at ALL times.  Cards like Tarim, lich king, etc are cards that show that a card that is good from behind, equal, and winning games are EXTRA good.
---
Madam lazul is only good in certain very specific situations that are fairly unlikely...
---
I have max golden copies for the common cards and 2400dust currently. I have NO copies of any of the rares/epics/legendaries. What should I craft if I want maximum dust value? 
---
The “proper” etiquette is for the loser to give the Well Played first to let the other side know that there are no hard feelings. That said it’s not really a big deal. I often find myself breaking that rule when it was a close game and I topdeck lethal or something. A little BM never hurts. :)
---
This is ... AWESOME =O
