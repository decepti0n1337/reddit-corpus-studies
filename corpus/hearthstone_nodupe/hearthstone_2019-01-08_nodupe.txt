No worries. I just think back to a recent post that talked about this sub and how there is never discussion, and I think it comes down to people feeling the need to shut down people instead of trying to help them understand the struggles vs X deck.
---

---
And I was having an off day yesterday, no harm done though ;)
---
and odd warrior just can't win against Rez Priest. Or any OTK decks for that matter. It is a stall out the game to fatigue kind of deck. It just doesn't have enough threats. The only way to generate threats is to boom ASAP to keep generating mechs, but then you lose out on armor. I have managed to beat one rez priest in my encounters, but that was because he played really badly and didn't get the combo from spellstone (like the only time for me lol).
---
I understand the meta btw. I can always make it to rank 5, even after taking 4 months off lol. I just keep getting good  matchups followed by priest to always end my streak. So I am just going to switch off. It isn't working, and sometimes you need to get lucky with matchups to get anywhere (when playing a deck like odd warrior).

---
See that's where they are clever. They only said the Cauldron didn't have any interaction, but you can drop the ingredients in the potion to the right. Never said anything about that O.o
---
Why did you reply twice and slightly differently each time? Apologize!
---
cause most of those cards are Hallucination
---
Emerald. I've been playing Secret Hunter since Beta and no bandwagon is going to make me hate having a second secret-synergy class card in a trap class. I waited all of Hearthstone for this card Yoggdamnit!
---
You’re right. It’s around 102.71 dust per pack. 
---
https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Card_pack_statistics
---
It’s important to keep in mind that’s the average dust per pack, not the median dust per pack. 
---
You’re going to see a bunch of 40 dust packs when you open packs, but these are offset by the dust from packs that contain legendaries or golden cards (or even golden legendaries). 
---
another secret thats broken on 144fps &gt;:(

Or at least let you pick class first then let you pick from the 3 shrines that class has
---
I did that golden teeth trick before knowing about the actual board secret, but i couldnt recreate it. :( What's the trick?
---
Infinite value from just one card is ridiculous. Other heroes require building around, Rexxar is something you just throw in there to win slow matchups. Yes, Uther will be better in late game, but the whole deck is built to do that, Hunter is often an aggro deck that gets free value generator for late game.
---
You know something is wrong when the most heavy control decks get outvalued by a secret hunter deck.

Extra gold is savings that let you keep playing arena even if you got bad luck streaks. They don't feel the need of having them daily but it's a nice thing to stock up.

Clearly he’s trying to fill your hand with treasures to mill you.

I've actually played it post Boomsday a lot and i recalling losing like once? to an aggro deck. It is that polarised that you must draw very badly to lose against any aggro deck which only happens with a bad mulligan.

Remember when Kripp spent like $1k on Un'Goro (I think?) packs and still didn't get all the cards? 
---
Yeesh.
---
The “joke” he’s whooshing on was stupid and based on a wild exaggeration. 
---
I get the sense that you're complaining about the result here, but you should understand that your tracking just got you the only card you need to auto win this matchup, and that's all you should care about.

Alright, so each adventure (other than LoE) has exactly one legend that sees evergreen competitive play.
---
For Naxxramas, you have Loatheb.
---
For Blackrock Mountain, you have Emperor Thaurissan.
---
For Karazhan, you have Barnes.
---
\---
---
In addition to these evergreen legends, Medivh himself is the sort of card that has the capacity to flit into the meta if stuff he likes gets added to the game, and the Curator is a 7 mana 4/6 taunt with a tutor effect, so both can see use. The curator was super common in the Un'Goro meta, as paladins had good stuff to pull in all three flavors of tutor. This can (and probably will) happen again. Moreover, Kel'Thuzad from Naxx sees fringe use, but it's honestly more fringe than Medivh.
---
Non-legends 
---
Karazhan lights up hard with the Arcane Giant, Swashburglar, Netherspite Historian, Firelands Portal, Babbling Book, Malchezaar's Imp, Enchanted Raven, and Maelstrom Portal.
---
Blackrock Mountain hands out Quick Shot, Gang Up, Resurrect, Flamewanker, Solemn Vigil, Dark Iron Skulker, Twilight Whelp, and Lava Shock.
---
Naxxramas has the fewest cards, but still gives Haunted Creeper, Sludge Belcher, Deathlord, Poison Seeds, Avenge, and Mad Scientist.
---
Building a Deck
---
Reno - Fits into Renomage, Renolock, and Renopriest
---
  Reno Priest - Brann Bronzebeard, Shadowreaper Anduin, Kazakus and Raza the Chained (adventures don't help)
---
  Reno Warlock - Brann, Kazakus, Emperor Thaurissan, various heavy-value legends and techs (BRM)
---
  Reno Mage - Brann, Kazakus, Medivh (Karazhan)
---
Anyfin Paladin - Curator (Karazhan), Solemn Vigil (BRM), removal removal removal, Warleader, Bluegill, Old Murk-Eye, Anyfin Can Happen! (This one right here is probably your easiest way to get a cool control deck cheaply. It feels like combo, but since it interacts more heavily, it's a "fair" combo and falls closer to control.)
---
More if you need it. Just ask.
---
Yes!
---
Was looking into this! Noticed that it's already available for EU and Korea, so hopefully it releases on US tonight as well! I haven't opened any of the wild cards, so that should be 4 legendaries with the 10 card pack rule!

Thank you so much once again! :)

If anything, the Knights could be compared to Energy from Kaladesh. The designers of that block deliberately didn't include a way to interact with an opponent's energy. What was the result? Energy became broken.
---
The problem with the Death Knights isn't just that they're too strong. It's that there is no way to interact with the upgrades they provide.

-gral -lich king

+fungalmancer(2)

It’s mostly luck but this deck has the highest win/loss record for me. I basically had to play it when the tavern gods gifted me golden hooktusk. I did get a free gral as well but fungal really helps keep the pressure on the turn after hooktusk. Damage from fungal wins games.

I like to pretend that the three cards are picked from the bottom of the deck and that the other two wouldn't have been drawn anyway :)
---
Beast Druid was actually really good. Maybe not Tier 1 but Tier 2 or high tier 3 at the worst.
---
Yeah Ive played hundreds of games vs the rat. Still never lost. You can mulligan the high cards. That guarantees you won't get them in your opening hand. 
---
Hmm that’s interesting, lich king was definitely top of the replace list, he feels clunky. I’ll swap him for a fungalmancer, and maybe try out swapping the minstrel for another fungal later
---
Priest spellstone is low-key hyper overpowered.  Compare to Kangor's Endless Army which wins like half the time when you play it, and Priest spellstone is arguably better and you can run more of them.
---
It's actually my favorite, Spell Hunter player since KnC, I don't like being the villain :(
---
&lt;0.

Proof: see username.

I would recommend only dusting cards when you want to make a new deck, and only dust what you need to. Piles of dust are useless, and those cards might get nerfed in the future

This is a piece of art commissioned by Team 5 but ultimately not incorporated into the game.

He's pretty good at conveying transparent energy like in his Mistwraith image. 
---
Same. Played the deck for more than a year, even when it was tier 3-4 back then. 
---
The number I've always seen is 100, so I don't know. 
---
My favorites: Those that require you to build at least part of your deck around it.
---
My least favorites: Those that are just straight up broken cards that fit  into any deck, like the warlock spellstone; 
---
Warlocks always played hellfire and will continue to play it after the spellstones rotate, and (not sure it stays in?) they'll keep playing kobold librarian. These cards are just insane on their own, they would play them without the spellstones. So the spellstone is a 4 mana 7 lifesteal, without any real downside, making it one of the most broken spell of all time, AND it synergize with the hero power (get back the life you lost) AND there's no way to play around it really, other than not playing any minion but that doesn't help you win.
---
Crabs are 1 mana 1/2s and they get f'ing buffed, I dunno how this card even exsists

It's mostly just bad players who hate how decks that counter theirs exist. I like to think my hate is usually reserved for decks that are absurdly strong for their type of deck (quest rogue, deathrattle hunter), but I'll acknowledge that my own biases play into that just as much as anyone else.

I don't play odd warrior, for the exact reason you said. It's also a huge offender in the polarizing state the game is in right now, I just find it far less of a slap in the face to lose to than combo. I just happened to use it as an example. I play dumb jank homebrew trash like grim rally egg warlock and even bomb Hunter. I lose a lot obviously but the games lost to combo just make me feel like I shouldn't have bothered playing.
---
I played Mecha'thun priest for a brief time when my local meta was packed with odd warriors, and I farmed them. It was actually just impossible to lose. As hopeless as some games against odd warrior may seem, it feels as though there's at least some chance of victory. Even with a dumb grim rally warlock I've beaten odd warrior several times despite losing most of the games played against it.
---
I see your point that combo has its purpose, but the rock paper scissors thing feels most apparent with combo. Druid is frustrating because they draw their deck out effortlessly and have Spreading Plague which punishes you for playing the game. Priest is frustrating because Hemet has guaranteed the combo on turn 10 in several games I've both played and played against the deck, as well as Psychic Scream (which they as pretty much guaranteed to have on 7 because of Shadow Visions) probably being the most broken removal in the game and supplementing the hopeless feel.
---
As much as everyone hated shudderwock shaman, I'm realizing that it was more manageable than my previous examples because they had to deal with overload on volcano and lightning storm as well as not being totally guaranteed to draw everything they needed due to the inconsistencies of mana tide totem and acolyte of pain. So maybe I have more of a problem with the current combo enablers and not the concept of combo itself.

How the fuck do people like you defend practices like that? $1000 should get you all the cards. End of argument.

Odd warriors are the weaker warrior decks against odd paladin.  (non-odd warriors get like...warpath and blood razor, and yeah, kinda stomp).
---
Should still be slightly advantaged for Odd Warrior.
---
he has a lot of content on the omnislash channel with firebat and others
---
Thank you so much for the lists! The shaman jade deck is so fun to play, I just replaced my nonexistent loatheb for mojomaster zihi and it works wonders
---
What a problem to have lmfao. 
---
Even Rogue does well against Odd Pally since your hero power is mana-efficient against theirs.
---
But you could craft golden cards that you like so you can have them also golden in arena. Just like Kripp!
---
Specifically Quest Odd Warrior. Worse control tools in exchange for the chance of sniping any one 1/1 dude with an 8 damage hero power. Regular Odd Warrior has it much better!

Weird flex but ok

I remember a sword surrounded by flames on a small island in the tutorial area. Was that ever solved or was it an unsolvable mystery?
---
I think balance wise the card is at a fine spot right now, so it's very unlikely to be nerfed. Changing it to 6 would probably make it too fair to be playable. Even Paladin already has a very contested spot for 6 cost cards, but it would still be a good draw tool and a somewhat decent way to refill the board after a clear, so it could be an option maybe as a one of.
---
If you don't have it, League of Explorers is still best value even if you didn't get your legendaries from these packs since you're guaranteed to get 3 meta staple legendaries, 2 other great legendaries AND an adventure.
---
One Night gives you 5 legendaries including Barnes, Blackrock includes Majordomo and Naxxramas gives you Loatheb. One Night has an Epic (you get both copies) and Naxx has 2 Epics. League has 2 Epics as well.

In comparison to these, the Wild Bundle seems super bad, I guess it's better than buying packs though.

Hi, I just tried the solutions that you gave me but it's still get stuck on the saloon doors. I did tried reinstalling the game and tried to make the app crash but I think I did it wrong. Are there any other solutions out there?Also I had this game for awhile but begin playing it again a few month ago and plays perfectly, don't know why but it stop working now. 
---
Misinformation *and* a personal attack? Well damn son.
---
I agree with you and I'm also somewhat cynical as to whether or not op really did donate the money. All the proof that op showed us is a screenshot stating that he donated the money but he could've very easily just photoshopped the image. We have no evidence that he did or didnt do it aside from a screenshit. I posted this comment earlier but was downvoted as well.
---
The picks from left to right are: Lawful Good, Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Neutral. Elise is definitely the safe pick. The others if you feel lucky or want to crush your opponent from an already winning position. Whilte Oondasta can highroll with other beasts, the rush kinda makes it somewhat playable on its own. But would you play a Charged Devilsaur for 9 mana?
---
&gt;  If you thought druidstone for the past year and a half was bad in standard, you have no idea how trash wild has been.
---
No idea what you're talking about, wild has a very varied meta: https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot/wild/2019-1-1
---
And of course it is stale, the whole idea of wild is that cards don't rotate. LOL
---
How are you so sure that op actually donated any money at all aside from this screenshot? He could've photoshopped the image

and don't worry , all of those 3 decks are your favourite type to play, combo deck, so maybe try it?  it may not be tier 1 but as long as it's not dead as discardlock or freeze shaman , then it should be fine.
---
would you remove the the highmane?

I believe it's still aged that way in wild, except you can use masters call to draw Barnes much more consistently. Wild is a gross place

I spoke to Kosak about this at BlizzCon. He mentioned that the current plan is to not rotate out adventure content. He mentioned that it is possible they will make the old single player content an optional download in the future so that the client size is minimized. Similar to how you can redownload a movie you purchased on iTunes.  
---
Nice! I've been playing since beta and have never opened a golden legendary, so grats! 
---
Totally agree, it’s getting to the point that I’m not having any fun.  The game is who can draw the right cards first.
---
But the inflation has only gotten worse here? Are they using old currency values?
---
Or skull pulls
---
Aggro is always kinda cheap and pretty much always powerful.
---
Most important card rn for Aggro decks is Baku the mooneater.
---
Also, if you'd like to test a lot, whizbang the wonderful is an amazing card.
---
It is a single card that gives you one of those decks blizzard recommends while constructing a deck at random each game. Not op, some are weak, but the value is insane. 16 decks for 1600 dust.
---
Also, token druid is dead. Long live otk druid with more armor than control Warrior. I'm not joking.
---
Yep, this here. I love control warrior, but facing a cardless odd paladin when you have 20 armor isn't exactly the peak of intense gameplay either, and must feel terrible to my opponent. I justify it by calling them mindless aggro players, but they're people too.
---
You can took a look on www.hearthpwn.com  
---
It's capped at 5 mana for each half.
---
First pick is cards with text (and no keywords except those in Battlecries and Deathrattles), second pick is vanilla minions and those with keywords only.
---
&gt; Everyone loves custom and merging cards; 
---
Team 5 sure doesn't.
---
There are a few things tho you definetely should read online before. Like "Test subject" priest, immortal prelate spell damage paladin... Stuff like that...
---
I assume it'll still be available to players who have it, and be available to players who purchase KotFT packs after rotation.
---
But I'm not Blizzard. So we'd need a blue post to confirm.
---
Definitely. Combo decks are more fun to play against when there's some interaction with the combo.
---
Think original C'Thun. Eventually the sheer amount of damage he could put out would almost certainly kill you, but you had multiple ways of trying to survive. Many Control vs C'Thun matchups were brutal fights for board control as one player tried to put up a wall to soak the damage while the other tried to clear that wall before delivering the finishing blow.
---
Oh i didn't zoom in. My bad
---
Mech Hunter in Wild is very much a thing largely because the new mechs have strong synergies with GVG cards like Mechwarper, Annoy-o-Tron, Metaltooth Leaper, Enhance-o Mechano, and Piloted Shredder.
---
If anything, it shows that the new mechs are strong, just lack more synergies.
---
I do think dragon hawk emeriss hunter is a good meme..

Play dire frenzy on dragon hawk, emeriss the copies.. = 8/8 dragon hawk.. play them with tundra rhino for otk smorc

kingsbane did not handle aggro betetr then warlock at all, unless you ahd god draw. no leeching + kingsbane + multiple weapon buffs and ways to pull it again in first few turns youd just loose to almost any aggresion whatssoever.

---
You can purchase a new hero for your favorite class* in the shop.
---
*If your favorite class is Warrior, Hunter, or Mage.
---
You don't get any extra compensation for cards that rotate, just the usual disenchant value. I personally would never dust rotating cards, but up to you ofc.
---
Not too bold but here we go:
---
- There will be very few cards heading into Hall of Fame, **if any**.
---
- One of the 2019 expansions will have water/underwater theme, as that hasn't been explored that much yet.
---
- The meta right after the rotation should be much healthier, free of K&amp;C and mostly KFT (still depending on new set of course).
---
- Warrior will keep having either none or one single prominent meta deck (like Odd Warrior for example).

My only golden legendary was The Voraxx. :(

Oh yeah I hadn't thought of call to arms, I might try this list

| Let's make more cards like Rexxar
---
🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
Is this worth buying if I have never opened a pack for any of these expansions before (I started in K&amp;C) but only would buy it for the dust?
---
Added! My tag is Semifreddo#2224
---
Which is one of the very few board clears they have. 
---
Tried it out with TGT and GvG. Those worked fine. Guess it glitched out for me on WoTOG.

OOw

---
lowest playernumbers ever
---
So you just want to make a channel that's like Trolden, etc?
---
Ya it seems to be the "word of the wise" to not dust much hehe,
---
But if im f2p and would like zilliax, whats my fastest way there :D
---
Yes sir :)
---
This is satisfying 
---
I don't know how many, it's not like there's some archive. People just post about it when it happens. But again, you can easily see for yourself that it's been done several times.
---
&gt;And even then, to the best of my understanding, they only make it to legend every couple of seasons - often taking up the whole month of playing to do so.
---
They don't do it continuously, that's not the point. It's just a challenge  people have done to see what's possible. But even then, you wouldn't even need to see it done to know that's it possible. Some of the best decks in the game have been really cheap and it's easier than ever to get a lot of dust just starting out with all the free stuff they offer beginners now. After that, it's just about being good and spending the necessary.
---
And again, the entire point isn't to say "this is practical," it's to simply illustrate how skill trumps money in the game.
---
It is because all the cards are in standard. And I did not start playing until the end of the old gods set, so I don't have any goblins or TGT cards. Missing the old mechs from the first list, rhok delar from the second and crackle/totemcarvers from the shaman deck lol. 
---
It's probably the median too. More than 50% of packs are 40 dust.

For other players, just be aware in this fight that Vustrasz has two Lightbomb's in the deck. So don't over-commit into it.

Slight nitpick but the term average can accurately refer to the mean, median, or mode.
---
BitahProphet#1757 NA trading 80g quest, show me pls
---
I have 2 OTK decks that can hit with 5 mana
---
Spell Hunter is hugely popular but also the worst of the 4 major Hunter decks. Not to mention both Deathstalker Rexxar and Rhok'Delar are about to rotate. Not a good craft.
---
Would it be possible to get someone there to gift you packs at that rate?
---
Probably because it relieves blizzard of the responsibility to fix any unintended interactions which occur as a result of new cards or changes to old cards being used for an adventure that was designed for a specific set of cards some time ago. 
---
This is arena. Chances are he never got those cards.
---
&gt; As a 1 time effect this card is probably not even as good as people think
---
As a 1 time effect this card is absolutely terrible. The fact that just the crafting alone is costing you 5-6 mana makes it completely unplayable in any somewhat serious deck.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
For 1-2 mana it **might** see play somewhere, because combined with the Warlock weapon and Cube's you could do some whacky things.     
---
&amp;nbsp;   
---
For 5-6 mana they're two of the worst cards in the game. 
---
Is this a promotion? 
---
Yeah, I had a bit of a tough time wording that one. By 'within 10 packs' I meant within 10 packs of opening my last legendary (ex packs 74 and 81 had legendaries).  
---
I'll happily concede I got lucky, but stand by my assertion that you'll probably open at least one (probably closer to two legendaries) by opening 40 packs across 4 expansions even if they just hit the pity timer.
---
It happens every year to keep standard fresh. You aren't losing your cards you can still use them in wild format so you're not losing anything. 
---
My first major rotation was last year and I was overjoyed to find new ways to play and new decks to try out. Most importantly though I was happy to see decks that I hated being retired to wild. Decks like Jade Druid.
---
Well, it's not like Standard is so much better... It's just nature of Hearthstone, across all formats.
---
I put this up there with when I put in flare with deathrattle hunter, got Keleseth from stitched tracked, had 2 in my hand and didn’t understand why they weren’t yellow. 
---
Warrior is strong in Arena because he almost certainly had two of those cards.
---
If you haven't reached cummulative rank 20 with classes yet and have a friend that already plays HS he can earn a hero portrait if he sends you a recruit-a-friend-link https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/community/recruit-a-friend/
---
"Rock is fine, rest is unfun to play against!" - sincerely, Paper.
---
What you fail to mention as control Warrior player, is that the current control Warrior iteration (Baku) is similarly stupid against everything with a win-condition based on finite damage.
---
In reality almost all viable strategies have moved more towards the extremes over the years. Combo has infinite damage or straight up "win the game" (Uther, Mecha'thun) with fewer cards, so they can dedicate more cardslots to cycle and survival. Midrange has the ability to create board states that are very hard to get rid of before they snowball (cubed deathrattles, turn 3 giants). Control in return has now silence attached to AoE (Psychic Scream) or almost infinite lifegain (Odd Warrior). Aggro, while not as fast as in the Patches era, has reached a level of consistency (turn 2 Baku heropower, guaranteed curveout with Genn) that makes predecessor versions pale in comparison.
---
What fell by the wayside is counterplay. And to be honest it was already sparse to begin with early on. Your desire for more disruptive tools as a control player is understandable, but in the same way aggro/midrange players are desperate for a more fair damage to lifegain ratio or even for anti-Armor tools when playing against Odd Warrior right now.
---
Blizzard likes to balance "round-robin". Everything gets their spot in the sun for some time until it rotates or gets nerfed when it was too oppressive for too long. Right now it seems like we are in the era of combo, so naturally the lack of anti-combo tools attracts the most attention. But the underlying problem is archetype independant:
---
There is not enough counterplay in Hearthstone!
---
Added.
---
My guess is it will be with the Winter Championship at the end of February.  There's a small chance they could tie it into the Wild Open Finals a week earlier.
---
Problem is that aggro can beat control, but against combo control is far more unfavoured. I don't want to play 'rock paper scissors' to be honest, I want aggro to be able to run control over sometimes and I want control to have chances to deal with otks.
---
Next week at the winter playoffs
---
now that you say it it makes a lot of sense, there's been times where I've only rezed voidlords (either because my doomguards got polymorphed or I had to gul'dan early vs midrange), this would've made it another way to get lethal
---
Thank you so much! However as a new player I don't have many cards you mentioned, like rotface, keles, grommash etc.
---
I do have boomship tho, but most of time I think it's just unplayable? Yea I can see the good synergies with scout in your deck, but you really got luck to draw it through scout, otherwise it could be very dead. That's just my own opinion, any thoughts any that? I'm a new player and really appreciate it if veteran players like you could give me some advice XD
---
In the same way that a dingy is kind of the same as a battleship, sure. 
---
I just cant understand how Worgen, FoN, Freeze Mage and Patron were all unhealthy, but Quest Mage, Mechathun, Paladin OTK, Aviana Kun, Exodia Mage, Machine Gun Priest, Togwaggle, Malygos, etc etc. But all somehow aren't held to the same degree? All those combos are significantly worse than what we've had the past 2 years. If you nerf something because its unintereactive, stop fucking printing OTK cards and combos. Be consistent for one God damn year. 
---
I didn't come up with that figure, that's just what people say. I guess the thing to think about is that the packs which are good, legendaries etc., drag the mean up.
---
RoughRogue#21969 EU 80g quest. I’ll show, you go first
---
Lost it at Grim Patron. Well done 
---
These cards are nothing like the reason people hate Rexxar. Zombeasts in themselves aren't OP. It's the infinite value of being able to create on every turn that is.  
---
A card that was just 2 mana "create a zombeast" wouldn't even be played. It's the fact that it's a single card that gives you 2 mana "create a zombeast" **every turn for the rest of the game** that makes Rexxar good.
---
With the rotation coming up would it be better to save my dust for cards that could possibly be hall of famed or save it until I can make a tier 1/2 deck?
---
Psychicly? 
---
You're the first person I've seen that said this when talking about these matchups. It isnt that control is unflavored against combo, its that they literally cannot beat them with the current way combo decks work. You should never want your card game to have very literal rock-paper-scissors matchups. 
---
one taught me love, one taught me patience, one taught me pain
---
You're right this really seems to be the case. At least there is hope then lol. I'm familiar  with hs replay, is vicious syndicate more or less the same thing?
---
You'll be a lot better off crafting a [hybrid hunter](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/deck-library/hunter-decks/midrange-hunter/) than trying to make spell hunter work without Rhok'Delar, To My Side!, Flanking Strike, or a second Spellstone. Those are basically the best cards in the deck aside from Deathstalker Rexxar, Zul'Jin, and Baited Arrow.
---
Naga as new tribe
---
I tried to do that but in-app it says they are available for cash only.
---
&gt;Neither of those weapons are possible.
---
Try again...  
---
1. Doomhammer + Candleshot  
---
2. Sword of Justice + Twig
---
&gt;So i'm going to be honest, being a control Warrior player since TGT OTK decks haven't really bothered me until things like unlimited damage Priest, Mecha'Thun, Exodia Pally etc which don't care about armor 
---
Translation:  I don't like decks that have the ability to counter my chosen deck.
---
From my experience, and I played a great deal of both (roughly 8 in Wild, 5~Legend in Standard) and the BM in Wild is eons higher. It's far from the end of the world since you can silence them, but it makes me envision the Wild community being just far more rude, esp in a format that needs more players.
---
I bought it because I was guaranteed a Legendary from each, having never opened any packs before (besides 1 Whispers to get C'Thun). 
---
How did I do? [[Don Han'Cho]], [[N'Zoth, the Corrupter]], and [[Icehowl]] all seem pretty useful, though [[Mogor the Ogre]] looks pretty shit.
---
Got those 4, 8 epics, 40 rares (1 golden), and 148 common (1 golden)

Oh, right, it's not one turn stealth.

You'll get a minimum of four legendaries, likely not more than that. Let's say 1600-2000 dust.
---
IIRC pity timer for epics is 10, so minimum four epics, likely 4-8. That's 400-800 dust.
---
Approximately 40 rares is \~800 dust.
---
Add to that slightly less than 160 commons, 160x5=800 dust.
---
So that puts you roughly in the range of 3600-4500 dust for 25 money.
---
Yeah, I think that makes more sense. 
---
There's already whole bunch of hearthstone companion apps, but the one thing I never see atleast on the phone, is an arena tracker to give you scores on the sets of cars they give you during the drafting process. If someone were to make this for the phone I would even consider buying it.
---
Ahhh wild hearthstone. Haven't played on awhile. I assume the hearthstone team supports it regularly and doesn't neglect it? :D
---
These are all good cards. Keep Antonidas for eternity because it's classic. Worst case, you can disenchant Arugal because he's the worst of the bunch (which are all very good btw)
---
That bugged me so much, since it was lagging I was doing the math while waiting for the animations to finish and saw he had enough HP to kill everything except the 3/4 and then he hits the 3/4 first losing out on 2(3?) extra gonks.
---
Oh, if he took 4, that's a bit much. I was thinking maybe if he hadn't taken fatigue damage he could've been able to dump hand over 2 turns and then play naked Mechathun.
---
This is misinformation that I believed as well until I bought some gvg pcka and got nothing. If you have ever gotten a legendary from those sets, you are not garunteed anything. Do not listen to this guy.
---
No. There have been others. If anything, the only thing holding Spirit of the Shark back is that it has an even casting cost. Odd Rogue would love to have SI:7 Agent deal four damage on summon and have a minion that will usually stick around long enough to be buffed by Cobalt Scalebane and Cold Blood.
---
You don't have friends that clown you? I laughed
---
&gt; No. There have been others. 
---
...like?
---
&gt; That would feel awful to be on the receiving end of, especially for decks like OTK Paladin.
---
You just got a 5/3 Lifesteal weapon. Or a board full of Voidlords. Or Lifesteal for your elementals. Or you cast Shadow Word Death on the entire board. These are not insignificant boons.
---
If you *need* your Hero Power to win the game, then your deck is completely based on 1 card out of 30 to win. That is not healthy for the game.
---
If you read the Edit on the post or most of my other replies, my main gripe with combo decks currently is they are meant to be part of the rock/paper/scissors that Hearthstone tries to reinforce, however combo with 70 - 80% winrates against control and yet aggro only beats combo around 60% of the time is disproportionate, they should either be winning less against control OR losing more against aggro.
---
Hmm, $1000 to charity if it's not?
---
What about a Moonwell, Sunwell, and Well of Eternity themed expansion all in one?
---
He lost out on one gonk as far as I can tell. You get 2 attacks per kill since 2 gonks were out so he would’ve gotten 4 extra attacks by killing the small stuff but only 2 by killing the 3/4. However he also used up an additional attack so so instead of ending up at a total of +1 he would’ve ended up at (4-2) +2.
---
Why though? We already know the average for each rarity.
---
Yeah I know I just don’t *want* to play wild lol so my real question is will I be able to dust the cards being rotated out for full price? 
---
&gt; Bigger Drakkari Trickster 
---
LMAO 🤣😂🤣
---
Yep, these are great as well!
---
No, Rank 7 in wild is where half of your games are Big Priest
---
For fun. Sorry to offend you with my redundancy.
---
I'm very tired so the math part of my brain is struggling, but I'm fairly certain that graph doesn't change what I'm saying.  
---
Let's say your last pack on every set was a legendary.  If you open 20 from one set or 5 from each of 4 different sets, your odds of hitting a legendary are the same.  
---
Once the rotation happens, Odd Warrior is gonna be really fucking good.
---
Everyone is losing everything, while odd Warrior is only losing Reckless Flurry
---
My request: a smooth, intuitive filter that works. The keywords used in the in-game collection manager search box have all sorts of oddities, and collide with card text pretty often. A simple form with drop-downs that populate fast, have good auto complete, "and"/"or"/"not" functionality, and full card results (not just names) would be awesome. Thanks for helping us draw attention to these problems!
---
As a legendary spell, seems manageable.
---
No, only cards that are specifically hall of games will be worth full dust (hall of fame only applies to classic cards that rotate out of standard)
---
I... keep all of them, dammit. Nothing is rotating, and they all do interesting things.
---
\*Internet Explorer wants to know your location\*
---
Boy are you going to be mad when it's still tier 1.
---
Of course it was rejected, they needed a legendary card to force players to buy more packs.
---
I was just saying that total weapon damage scales quadratically. An x/x weapon can do up to x^(2) damage.
---
Its only Rock Paper Scissors now because of the nerfs.  A month ago we were playing “Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock”.  Now it’s “Big Rock, Safety scissors, wet paper”.
---
13 mana**
---
The worst thing for me as a paladin main was that every paladin deck lived or died by how well it used CtA. The class became universally one dimensional overnight, and it was terrible once the cool factor of the card (because it was a very badass card to play with it’s sound and visuals and power) wore off.
---
Decks I loved like recruit paladin (wild) couldn’t use it so well, so it got booted in favor of aggro paladin which I maintain to this day as THE most boring aggro deck in the games history. It had all the boring parts of a token deck and none of the satisfying ones, tickling your opponent to death with pathetic little tokens while just crossing your fingers they didn’t have aoe and somehow ending up with a good win rate.
---
Around the time of the nerf announcement I remember being so happy the damn thing was going to be gone. I was happy to give up my favorite class’ spot in the top tiers to be free of call to arms.
---
All this to say, fuck that card.
---
Baku and Gen
---
Obviously but it's the closest thing we have to any metric on declining/increasing population.
---
It’s the one VS recommends, it has a superior winrate. I greatly recommend their version that runs blessing of kings from the datareaper.
---
The weapon came from an epic 5 mana spell card.  You are doing this one or twice realistically a game, not a turn.  AND that's only if the twig shows up in the pool.  
---
You, sir, aren't thinking this through.
---
Dont
---
What are you talking about - this isn't 2017.
---
Creating "new" decks on mobile is super easy. I just copy the deck code from VS like everyone else, toggle over to the game, then enter my collection and it's all ready to go. 
---
EZ PZ. 
---
Plus the overload!

"I tried a few but I ended up boring myself" Translation: He tried a few of them and messed up the combo and gave up after a few humiliating loses lol.

jaraxxus + malganis

Filtering while building your deck should feel similar to filtering while building your deck. But I understand how implementing these features can be challenging.
---
Thanks for that info man I appreciate it
---
I doubt the first two are anywhere near impossible to do with Cleric around and the others don't really have anything to do with Cleric.
---
I think Priest's problem is it's Classic and Basic sets are too narrow in general. I don't think Hall of Faming Cleric is what Priest needs to get the kinds of cards that would enable totally different archetypes.
---
Only major craft for odd paladin rotating out is corridor creeper
---
Odd rogue mostly just losing vilespine
---
The new dragon odd warrior keeps most of its cards too
---
No decks use "just" stuff that won't rotate out but those are your best bets
---
You can just edit your post too
---
I would agree however you don't need all the contact of an expansion to just play and do well at the game.  
---
If you want to be one of these top competitive players I would say you do as you're going to need every card to experiment with and form counter decks etc.  
---
This is what is somewhat annoying about the whole "competitive" scene of HS is that it's not neccessarily so much about being better than other players it's about having more resources to be better.  
---
I wonder further if these players (streamers, known competitive players) even have to buy their own resources or if it's supplied free by blizzard.  Streamers can at least use twitch revenue to fund their collection.
---
Generally, I'm reading Reddit as the first thing I do, even before I have my coffee. Trying to figure out posts without minimal context makes me grumpy. Yes, some of them are pretty easy, like this specific one, but does it really take any effort for the poster to provide a few damned details, even if it's just as the top comment? 
---
Iirc this was from the set of arena only cards the audience voted on at blizzcon so players actually rejected this one.
---
I used to agree with you, but "combo" in Hearthstone is a lot closer to a Control deck than "combo" from magic or Yu Gi Oh. 
---
There are no t4-t5 combo deck wins that I can think of, as you can't really cheat out a whole bunch of cards early. So combo leans towards a more control style game plan. And in this case, where you have "control deck that wins by forcing players to draw all their cards" and "deck that wins by drawing most of their cards" then it's obvious why control shouldn't ever beat Combo.
---
If you want to be a classical control deck that stands a chance against combo, you have to develop a threat and protect it before they kill you. If you say "my deck has no sticky threats that can win" or "I just can't kill them!" then the deck has a fundamental design flaw.

Too bad [[kooky chemist]] is in wild now
---
Odd Pally is losing both rare weapons though, they are very important for the deck.

4/4/4 | Battlecry: Swap the Attack and Health of a minion.  
---
The pity timer already is 10 if you’ve never opened a pack from that set before (“before” being before they instituted this rule).
---
&gt; lem, and we can look up, on average, how many legendaries it would take to collect all 23 purely by chance. It's 8
---
It would work out quite differently than that since you would disenchant the cards you dont need rather than 700 packs in a row.
---
[here](https://speedodevo.github.io/packr/) is a link to a simulator. You can get 855 packs for $1000, i put that in and it gave me a little over 75k dust disenchanting duplicates and goldens. Assuming your 70k estimate this is enough to craft a set and have a little left over.
---
Oops yep how could I forget the 7 mana weapon sorry!
---
Yeah, there is really no meta deck to craft just with the new stuff, but I still think new players can safely craft odd pala or odd rogue (or if their heart so desires, odd warrior)
---
&gt;He wouldn't auto lose if he had more than one win condition lol
---
Isn't one wincondition ... like ... the definition of combo?
---
I started playing around October, never played Wild, don't think I'll ever do. Should I get the wild bundle for the dust??  
---
  
---
Also, about the solo adventures, do they still reward cards? Is it worth it to get for example League of Explorers just to dust the legendaries?
---
Lovely.
---
&gt; Should I disenchant cards to build one good deck? I've got a couple legendary cards, but I'm not sure. =]
---
Generally, I'd recommend disenchanting bad or impractical epics and legendaries to craft a competitive deck so you can start taking care of your quests and climbing the ladder before saving up for the next expansion. The game gives you two dozen or so packs by the time you leave the beginner ranks and you're guaranteed a legendary within the first ten packs of each set so it's easy to get seven or so legendaries early on.
---
Too bad it’s a demon. 
---
They used to organised something llike sealed draft for tournament, where they opened lots of pack and used what they found.
---
I love the idea but I feel like there‘s just to few Demons to make that work and the weapon one is just broken. Gorehowl, Candleshot and Doomhammer all sound like they’d be pretty busted if combined with anything really. Spectral cutlass sounds like the nuts. 
---
A 5/10 windfury weapon? That’s 50 dmg. Sure if you make the craft effect expensive enough so that you have to spend a whole turn crafting the weapon it’d probably work out but just not satisfying for either party since that’s a lot of commitment to either just win the game as a result or get the bad rng and get offered crap / walk right into a weapon removal. 
---
Jan 22nd I believe. 
---
Also, can confirm as a 'wild naive' player that I got 5 Legendaries, never having opened any of these packs before. 
---
For lc? Or for even shaman?
---
"bad battlecry"
---
&gt;Deathlord
---
hmmmmmmmm...
---
Ty.
---
Yeah I'm scared of the nerfs. 
---
So you think I should go for big priest (4000 dust)
---
And even shaman (1000 without aya)
---
Or should i just go for something else. I'm also considering renolock (I just love control)..but there I'm missing 3 legendaries (zola, malganis, kazakus)
---
In addition the pool of cards would have to be very limited to be any good. There are a lot of shit demons you wouldn't want to show up.
---
Honestly, it's just too much.
---
50 immune dmg xD ahahhaha true! But I wanted to create something like zombeasts for the other classes because im so done with Hunter......
---
You made me look 
---
LOL. sure thing buddy.
---
Are you giving yourself there advice? Or are you a legend player who thinks that makes you king of hearthstone?
---
5 is trash? So what are you?? Hmm?
---
To much fun for you 😈
---
I'd assume that it's run to proc Windfury on Corpsetaker in a fairly aggressive deck? So they don't need to run Stormwatcher.
---
7.5% chance to get any one specific beast from the first pick pool in Standard.
---
The backpedaling here is astounding. Remember when you said this, not even an hour ago: "But Odd warrior CAN'T beat OTK. It can't happen."? All I did was prove to you that Odd Warrior creates the same kind of terrible polarized matchups that Exodia Paladin does. I'm not saying control is terrible, nor am I saying Exodia Paladin is healthy for the game. What I am saying however is that both you and TC are playing the victim card when in reality the deck you love to play creates some serious problems itself, which is why you look like hypocrites. And then you make it even worse by displaying horrible ignorance like claiming Odd Warrior "CAN'T EVER" beat OTK decks as if the winrate is a flat 0 and a victory is impossible, which is just a laughable sentiment that shows your lack of understanding of how the game actually works. 
---
Big yikes from me
---
Eye of eternity!

Craft a custom spell
---
655. Just told you. Read.
---
... I did not know that...
---
If you get 13 cards you are burning some.
---
Also, that requires you and your opponent having an entire board. You dont only play northsire, but also pyro and circle. And you only heal his board too for drawing. Then the next turn the hunter hits you in the face for 16/17 with a devilsaur and king crush, odd rogue fuking wons before you even have 5-6 mana to pull the combo, and even mechathun druid draws fasters and does his combo before you can even use yours to draw 3-4 cards.
---
Drawing cards is not that broken. The thing is, what do you do wiht said cards that can be broken. And right now (and foreseable in the future), priest doesnt have nor had plans on getting something that could be problematic with draws. The closest priest was to being problematic thanks to drawing a lot was with razakus priest. And I dont need to tell you how important (/s) northshire was in that deck.
---
It is not a bad card, its a good card. But its not strong enough to warrant a nerf/hall of fame.
---
I don't. 
---
Balance &gt;
---
Found the hunter player see you in April lol
---
I mean chances are you drew what you needed when you drew 10 cards lol 
---
Am I right in saying that you don't mind the rock-paper-scissors aspect of hearthstone, but would prefer a game state in which there was a way for paper to beat scissors, for rock to beat paper and scissors beat rock even if this is through a rng effect like dirty rat and gnomeferatu.
---
Well, I can't say that I have much fun in this game this expansion. I don't spend much time, almost any money at all, but usually, I enjoy myself. According to my stats, for the last week, there is 37% hunters. From HSstats Its overall 26% of all decks that are a hunter. I don't think that is healthy... 
---
Ive been playing a fuck ton of pirate rogue and its definetly a tier 2 deck. Its very strong but it only runs 7 pirates. 
---
That's lovely but he's linked you to the pity timer impact, which shows that previous pulls affect the probability of the next pull. You assumption that each subsequent odds of a legendary unpacking are independent is false. You didn't read/understand anything in that link did you, "kiddo"
---
Someone else mentioned this but I just wanted to explain it further.
---
I think the biggest reason is against Hunter, if you trigger their secret, they are capable of playing that same secret again. So, by triggering it, you give your opponent the oppprtunity to buff their spellstone(s), or otherwise just make it so that a card that would have otherwise been unplayable becomes playable.
---
So you weigh your options and think, is your board good enough to the point where you can deal with that secret the following turn if your opponent plays it again? Or, is your board so good that your opponent must answer it with something better than that secret? And lastly, you consider if you can deal with an extra wolf being summoned from your opponent's spellstone that otherwise could not have been summoned had you not triggered their secret.
---
17 times damn, I didn’t know gonks stacked hm.
---
Even Shaman, Big Priest, and Odd Rogue are probably the three best decks but Renolock doesn’t seem too far behind.  I haven’t played Renolock, only against it, so I can’t speak too much on it.  I also see a fair amount of Reno Priest and Even Warlock in ranks 2-5 and there are also people who get there with lower powered decks like Mech Hunter and Jade Druid.
---
I think you can’t go wrong with any of the big three decks as a start and then expanding out to any decks you end up really appreciating when you play against them afterwards.  If you have a strong sense of your preferred playstyle (every game different with Reno, big minions with Big Priest, fast and oversized with some board control with Even Shaman, etc.) that’s what I’d go with because every smart line will get you where you want to go but only the deck you feel the most affinity for will get you there while maximizing your fun.

Forge a custom weapon* 
---
Huzzahhhhh

Mercfh#11786 (US), need to watch a friend win quest (spectate a friend in play mode or w/e)
---
&gt; There are certain cards like Emperor Thaurissan and Loatheb that may not be in the top decks, but are Wild staples and often useful.
---
Loatheb is mentioned in a blurb, so maybe the final "Wild Staple Cards" are ill-named..? Or should be "Other Wild Staples"?
---
Either way, Loatheb is a fine addition to any Wild collection. Strong card and is used in a few meta decks (e.g. Odd Rogue)
---
Hmm, I'll give it a try. What type of ticket did you open? Payments?
---
Not sure if you’re serious but this graphic has some issues. First of all it shows how certain cards are bad against dirty rat and yet it calls dirty rat a bad battlecry. 
---
Yeah for sure
---
I picked the Mecha'thun yeah lol
---
This is probably how team 5 thinks. 195 IQ.

You should apply to join team 5 and reinvigorate this daed gaem.

I was hoping for an image of morty as a car 
---
Personally I love it, Vivid Nightmare is so satisfying in there. However, its more difficult to pilot and not quite as strong on ladder where aggro is a more common

So bad that it doesnt even have a battlecry
---
No see think about it. You have two minions in hand: Wardruid Loti, and Silverback King. Your opponent plays Dirty Rat. What would be better for it to pull? It's a bad result for the opponent no matter what, but for you, there's only one bad result.
---
maybe replace the stargazer luna odd mage shell with the clockwork automaton odd mage shell instead? pushes more face damage, in exchange for crazy draw turns i guess. Plus, you still have black cat and pyromaniac to draw you cards.
---
[removed]
---
If you’re being serious, Patriarch has never been power creeped, even though it’s an intro card.
---
Why wouldn't it?
---
Situationally awful...
---
Turn 2 Tyrion ggwp 
---
Players, especially Spikes (those who derive their fun from winning), will typically crowd around decks that find the closest balance between expedient to climb ladder with (as in games are short), cheap to build, and capable of winning more than fifty percent of games. This applies doubly so for formats with heavily restricted and figured out card pools, as standard currently is, and the fact it tends to happen is not a fault of the game. It pretty much happens in every card game.
