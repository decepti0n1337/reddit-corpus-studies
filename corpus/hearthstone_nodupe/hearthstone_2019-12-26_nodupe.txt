That's not how it works. Don't try to full craft decks. Use your cards.
---
Tou live up to your name.  Ppl who playes that shaman trash were bad ppl and players.  Try to not net deck for once in your life
---
bees? theyre dragons
---
I don't need to. The game is coded so that it removes all treats despite it being different art. Bringing another card into this does not change the way the interaction between flik and treants work
---
Maybe they should nerf Brann - oh wait he‚Äôs not even in the game and some clown with 4K MMR is trying to pretend he has merit in a balance discussion.
---
Thanks
---
If a deck is relying on one single other deck being popular in order to be remotely playable, that deck has a problem. Not only a problem with its longevity (especially since, for a deck to be *that* popular, it will likely be nerfed) but also how enjoyable the deck is. After all, this is a game. Not a win-lose simulator.
---
hot girl make tree hot too
---
no offense, but it doesnt look that homebrew. seems like a standard galakrond warrior with slight twists.
---
Strongest one should be Raza Priest. Most fun was Mill Rogue, if that counts.

Wow. You're insulting a guy for seeing things differently than you do and getting a different experience than you did. If you can't see why you're such a douche then you're hopeless.

I mean you could make a deck in most classes that hard counters face hunter with neutral healing/taunts supplemented by class cards. The problem being those decks don't work against the rest of the meta. Res priest seems to do ok vs other non tier 1 decks so it's ok, but just countering a good deck isn't enough to be "good"
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/eauiwo/the_2000_dust_face_hunter_deck_that_took_me_from/
---
I used this list with an extra timber wolf instead of spellzerker to get to legend. There are other lists though.
---
Absolutely, it really depends on what class/archetype you are playing against.  Healing class like Priest or Paladin is all about constant pressure and quick damage to outspeed their heals, but in a control, situation, as you said, efficency becomes more important than raw speed.
---
Mom spends a ton on diapers. Amirite?
---
It's not that good even in arena since it doesn't do anything if you are behind on the board. But it does make for a great win more card and actually does something the moment you play it so it's decent.
---
Totally, I‚Äôve tried playing face decks and I just get bored to death and the games I win feel so unfair it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm playing the game with myself
---
Quest mogu cultist warlock = 100% vs priest.
---
Definitely think the rivalry thing is pretty good, I've experienced it a lot and it's pretty fun. Facing the strongest opponents over and over again isn't very fun but it's incredibly rare so I think it's fine. I got super tilted when it happened to me though.
---
Whenever this brawl pops up, I always forget that a boss appears after the decorations are done.
---
Quickly running the math in my head that would have still been higher odds right?
---
I flipped a coin 10 times.  Came up heads 6 times.  Clearly not random.
---
LOL
---
I didnt know how to add two images but you get the hero power after you kill the liches minions

I think the best part of this meme is that patrick probably isn't any smarter in the picture on the left.
---
I recommend treat druid, I climbed to 5 with it, but I'm calling BS on 13-4 in an hour.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what Baron and Zapp at tier 3 have to do with anything. Zapp is a good example of a really good situational minion. 
---
If this idea is dumb then Nefarian as a hero is really dumb as his hero power doesn‚Äôt take up a minion slot and only effects the opponents side of the board. We all know the frustrations of facing a late game Nef, and also the joys of stomping on players with Nef using suboptimal compositions. There really is no counterplay to it. Facing a Nef with divine shield/poison/windfury  murlocs? Yeah time to concede.. Explosive sheep least evens the playing field. 
---
I already mentioned why this is not an auto-include. Cobalt guardian builds can just throw in a mecharoo to bring back divine shields. Having explosive sheep against a non divine shield comp is a disadvantage as this is a waste of a minion slot.
---
I may get labeled a ‚Äúsnowflake‚Äù but I‚Äôve had a family and a friend that battled and lost to cancer. Seeing it tossed around to describe anything game related just seems unnecessary to me
---
What‚Äôs your winrate with it and at what rank, I‚Äôm only missing 1 epic so I might make it, I‚Äôd just like to know before, thanks
---
nah not particularly, the extra loss for every twenty games wont make nearly as much of a damage as making an entirely new deck.
---
Hence the try part
---
Galakrond Tempo Warrior is apparently the top dog now, with multiple versions that made Legend. And Pirate was already one of the strongest decks.
---
Seems like the perfect deck to play while drunk on the holidays. As long as you come to in time to slap down that t5 infiltrator your good.
---
It should read as "One cheap shorty boi"
---
[[Living Dragonbreath]] is the answer (probably).
---
Not really, I think its slightly favored for even hunter but you can pull off a win. With Dendrologist discovering healing and then in general Savage roar burst. But you building a board against face hunter just gives them unleash the hounds burst and their explosive trap kills your early game treants.
---
You mean, instead of the large and loud MALFURION *VERSUSSSSSSSSSS* VALEERA?

I see, maybe I‚Äôll try it out and see how I fair

I played AF Kay and one of the recruitment maps gave me really bad minions so I picked shifter zerus. He transformed into a tier 6 minion, savannah highmane, which got me to an easy 2nd where I lost to perfect rng Yogg
---
This happens all the time since the beginning of the legend system.  Your ranking is constantly changing as people around your rank win/lose and move you up/down.  When you started this match you weren't actually rank 201, but you hadn't relogged or played a match to have it update.
---
Fer‚Äôreal though, you‚Äôre straight up huffing glue if you don‚Äôt keep ‚Äòkrond or kronx in your opening hand.
---
For me the second one seems to apply for normal tavern brawl and co-op lol
---
I looked and they didn‚Äôt even show that one :(
---
I wanna craft this guy to see how thicc I can get my trees since I crafted floop for maly druid a few months ago (I unpacked Elise &amp; I got golden quest as my preorder leggy lol, it was a sign)
---
He‚Äôll never forget this lesson though.
---
That seems to happen a lot
---
So true
---
I'd keep it. You don't know what things could be like next rotation. Treants may be busted. But if you don't enjoy that play style, then dust it for something you want.
---
Most of the treant cards do rotate out, when the current HS year ends. (Most are from boomsday/Witchwood)
---
It is at least a big taunt. I'm thinking it could be good in some big control druid just to make 2x The Forests Aid even stronger.
---
My "bar" is irrelevant. You avoided answering the question, which is just what I suspect someone lying would do. Until you prove otherwise, I'm going to assume you're lying and report/block you. Have a nice day.
---
Yea and thanks for naturalizing my biggest minions!
---
"At least I have Coke bottles"
---
Holy shit you're right
---
Don't craft stuff atm .. Just wait till 5th of Jan after which the HS Team might have another look at the meta for potential normalization of cards ..
---
Buying that minion will give you a triple
---
Yo I have quest I sent a friend request
---
My opponent is a Pepega every Tavern Brawl.
---
I started playing a little before the mechs expansion. But i always loooooved the cthun decks. I saw on youtube, maybe we both will get the old gods decks, and just switch to wild. Kinda think this one through though because currently i am trying to be a F2P player unlike when i started this game.
---
Can anyone tell me why no one complaining about this card? It can give so much value and the requirement is not that hard (since highlander deck has been established since Uldum).
---
They are not assholes they probably just dumb.

Higlander paladin works sometimes too.

---
Got it on my 3rd attempt. My first opponent was killing all my minions and using their damage battlecries on my face. My second opponent seemed like they were going to help but then towards the end started killing my minions. Third guy didn't have any issues with we kept each other healed up and killed everything.
---
Same MMR. It happens.
---
me go face
---
last time i played this much hearthstone was the frozon throne. I would take powerful expansion over the likes of witchood and rumble which were boring as hell.
---
When I played the deck it's very hit or miss. If you have the dude turn 4 or 5 you're probably gonna win. Longer than that it's down hill. But while you're trying to climb the ladder and you run into the deck, it's almost guaranteed that your opponent has it with every combo to go with it lol. That's what it feels like at least
---
Please, tell me more about that rank 50 meta.
---
Personally i have bested all these deck multiple time with my embiggen druid deck and went from rank 10 to 2 so im not complaining i think its nice to see multiple deck pop off in the meta since the nerf :)

Ok missworded it, the point I was trying to get across is that the dust ratio hasn't changed since then and players who can't put a decent amount of money on can't have a decent diversity of decks.

Value wise the new adventures aren't that good, they just give you packs, but they're fun if you just want to play. There will be a new adventure in a few weeks that will give us 34 new cards I think, so definitely hold on for that one. You can check decks on hsreplay.net, but honestly I wouldn't know what to recommend you to craft, meta has been pretty shifty lately. Currently the best deck is ressurect priest, but who knows how long will that last. Battlegrounds is your tipical auto chess game, if you score 4th or better you get 10g. It's very much rng oriented, so if that's your thing definitely check it out.

ah right mb
---
I think it's the same feeling as seeing Keleseth come down early, just knowing that you've now got to deal with your opponents buffed up minions while your own minions aren't. It's not strictly a loss when your opponent has those stronger minions but it's definitely demoralizing to see.
---
I'm not saying it's OP, but I can see why losing to that deck inspires complaints
---
Thank you a lot,if i were to buy packs(used to reach legend monthly and like the grind) would you suggest it and from which expansion? And 34 playable standard cards?
---
https://ss.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/edv04q/rank_3_to_legend_with_galakrond_priest_with_leeroy/
---
This is probably the cheapest option in that the legendaries are mostly free/neutral and the neutrals but most of the priest lists I've seen use 4+ legendaries and generally around 4-6 epics. That said, many decks run a quest archetype which doesn't heavily utilize cards from the current expac (mostly just grave rune) so if you open a decent number of packs from Arena runs or anything you might have a substantial amount of the cards.
---
https://ss.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/ef9oo5/legend_with_albatross_control_priest_making_bad/
---
I'm just saying it would have been a stronger point if you had three fewer capitalised words. I should have known your ego would be too fragile to take that in a positive way though.
---
Exactly, but as evidenced by the 5000 threads since the nerfs about how the meta predictions were wrong, people are mostly content with "I told you so" rather than a good meta. 
---
One class dominating the entire ladder is a sure sign of an unhealthy meta, therefor class diversity must be the sign of a healthy meta. It's the same kind of reductive, childish, black-and-white thinking that leads redditors to say shit like "you guys complain when your meal has no salt, then you complain when the chef dumps 50kg of salt on your plate??? wtf do you want you're never happy"
---
The meta right now is definitely extremely unhealthy, but acting superior to people who thought Deathrattle Rogue would be tier 1 is better than actually playing a well-balanced expansion.
---
Galakrond pricest yes not that good, even though   the invocations usually gets Pepole some really good minions, but res quest priest is actually aweful to play against
---
You should have the 10 pack guaranteed legendary for the Standard Sets. If you buy this year's you'll be able to use them for the next year. 
---
So you can start buying from each new set until you get a legendary and change to the next one, and so you maximise your chances. (Plus there are some freebies once you open this last exp).
---
The adventures are like they said on another comment. New mode does not give you nor cost anything.
---
Since the last nerf it seems we have reached some kind of balanced game for once...
---
The albatross variants beat Mage and Pally but rogue is pretty much unwinnable without atrocious draws on the rogue's side.
---
Yeah 12 Face Hunter in a row at rank 9 are totally imagination...looks like santa still didn't give you what you needed the most
---
&gt; If a deck has a 9-1 matchup
---
Priest is beating more than just hunter.
---
I don‚Äôt have a whole lot of legendaries, but King Krush is hella satisfying.
---
My dude, not everyone has the dust to experiment and create their own decks. Chill.
---
Grave rune and Albatross are fine but that's about it. Although one guy does seem to have made Galakrond work.
---
I literally just disenchanted like 3 of my decks for an anti-aggro priest
---
So play one of its many hard counters and shoot up to rank 5...?
---
This kind of effect doesnt make much sense.
---
Yeah, opponent needs to play legendaries, and the payoff/punishment if they do is... 2 1/5s? What can rogue do with them? Priest could do stuff but rogue? Why do we need an anti-legendary card tech? Why rogue? Why so expensive of an effect too?
---
A [[Generous Mummy]] on board? That's unusual.
---
First try win, this is so much easier than the mecha co-op brawl.

While I don't agree with that guys dumbass comment people who ask for decklist and ask questions like "what does that card do" in every fucking thread is why there are no discussion posts on this sub. Nobody wants to contribute to anything.
---
Thanks !
---
Too bad, that was kind of a cool bug
---
Not saying the overall point is wrong but I would be careful wit that kind of thinking because there have been a few situations like this but would say is the "meta is good" because it was extremely polarizing match-ups.
---
10 strong decks can be each of them having 60-40/40-60 match ups against the others which would be a "good meta" or can have them all having 90-10/10-90 match ups against the others and be an insanely polarizing meta.
---
But yeah right now is way more towards a balanced meta.
---
https://ss.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/ed99mw/whats_working_and_what_isnt_friday_december_20/fbgtdvb/
---
The only thing I consistently lose to is Rogue and control warrior with Dr. Boom. Anything else is auto-win or generally favored. Highlander mage and OTK pally both pretty heavily favor priest when you add Albatross.
---
My first brawl, I play Mukla on 3, my opponent plays the bananas on his reveler. I concede
---
Only 2/44 = 1/22 = 4.5% to hit a single DragonQueen Alexstrasza... So once every 22 games on average, if you get to play it every game, and since you usually don't with this aggro meta, it could easily end up being once every 100+ games. I do honestly consider that pretty rare.
---
Me neither. Whish i had. Thats why i need to change things around. I dont have Malygos so i had to come up with my own creation

---
I'm upset that retarded people like you are everywhere...you're so dumb you're a threat to everyone around you :)
---
Next rotation they lose Landscaping and Dendrologist. Hopefully Blizzard prints something to replace them.
---
Points for honesty bro
---
Its unlikely youd see the latter the more viable decks are around
---
The only 4 I think are actually bad are Face Hunter, Resurrect Priest, Deathrattle Rogue, and Pirate Warrior and I don't think they are bad because they are OP.
---
I think the meta is pretty balanced but the 4 decks I mentioned just feel awful to play against mostly due to the fact that they are extreme high roll decks and/or you need a specifc counter to beat them.
---
**Face Hunter and Pirate Warrior** are both very high roll and it feels off when you lose because they drew their high roll cards and against both you need a good amount of healing teched (more so Face Hunter) to actual do well against them. Hoenstly decks like Pirate Warrior and Face Hunter being unfun to play against is more of an issue with the format of ladder than the actual balance. If there was another ladder option that used a tournament styled format these decks would be way less problematic to me.
---
**Deathrattle Rogue** has two variants; The Anubisath Warbringer variant and the Mechanical Whelp variant. I'm far more okay with the Mechanical Whelp variant even though it's arguably better because it's not nearly as degenerate or high roll. The Anubisath Warbringer variant relies entirely on getting the Necrium Apothecary + Necrium Blade combo as soon as possible and if they high roll it's absurd. The entire deck is just play your curve, hope you high roll, and then slam buffed chargers on the board to win. It reminds me of Spiteful Druid and that deck was peak degeneracy.
---
**Ressurect Priest** is just the fucking least fun thing in existence to play against unless you have mass silence. It's Rise of Shadows Control Warrior but even less fun to play against because you can't even push face damage because of the absurd amount of healing and Taunt that deck has. Resurrect Priest isn't and never has been a fun or well designed archetype. 
---
The rest you listed are fine. I do hate the high roll nature of Highlander Decks but they are far less likely to high roll compared to Anubisath Deathrattle Rogue so I think they are fine. Galakrond Shaman and Galakrond Warrior basically function the same way which is keep the board cleared as much as possible which I think is fine because they aren't overdoing it. I don't know how anyone complains about Zoolock as it's one of the oldest and most fair decks out there, it's a deck that relies on interacting with the board which is a good thing.
---
It only works in it‚Äôs current form until rotation, though. Once Zul‚Äôjin leaves the deck gets quite a bit worse.
---
and they were right, because the cards they wanted buffed was to have some options other than rez Priest which is pretty much universally hated. Galakrond Priest for instance would be 100x more fun to play against and as, but unfortunately it's ass, so people don't play it. Same for Shadow Priest builds, same for Thief Priest and Dragon Priest.
---
Read it and asked myself why I haven't done this yet, then I remembered Discover, Invoke, Get random, Etc.
---
You can't attack when there are no Party Crashers or the Pinata on board...
---
outvalue control decks? You're joking right?

It's beautiful, except for the fact that you have antisynergy on your board. Big minions don't pew pew a bunch, you would want the imp gang boss instead with the voidlord.

I mean, I won‚Äôt say it‚Äôs balanced, but what I will say is that there is a lot of variety. You can find decent success with all classes, and most of them have different archetypes in case you feel like switching it up.
---
Play the "summon 3 1 cost minions to your opponent" minion.

Yeah, but you shouldn't *play* the mummy unless your opponent's hand is basically empty. Making all their cards cheaper is a great way of killing yourself.

-I put it away!
---
-Where?!
---
-Why do you need it?
---
-You tell me where did you put it, woman! We're talking about the greater evil!
---
-I'm your WIFE! THE GREATEST EVIL YOU'RE EVER GONNA GET!
---
OSFrog
---
It's called skill
---
I think we have a different understanding what very rare means than.
---
Icebreaker is the genericest name of all. But yeah weapons tend to have their own name. Not in wow but in every fiction universe.
---
Ahahaha.   What a douchebag.
---
The thing to remember about the rank system is that due to the way win streaks work, you can technically get all the way to rank 5 while losing more games than you win. At rank 5 and above, you need to have a positive win % to climb, so it is the first real cutoff point.
---
Dragon druid is pretty good. It lets you win with classes such as warrior hunter warlock mage etc.
---
Only problem is fighting with other druids and hunters
---
And there goes your karma.
---
It used to cost 3 mana and be in almost every deck! At 5 it's relegated largely to little used tech option, especially with odd decks not a thing any longer
---
Downvotes are cruel? Who the fuck even cares about Reddit points?
---
Just go on deck websites and see what‚Äôs popular.
---
1. I said pretty rare.
---
2. I guess I consider one in a hundred games pretty rare, yes. Sure, it's not once in a lifetime, but rare is usually something that happens
---
I‚Äôm not talking about priest specifically just explaining how a deck might have an amazing matchup but still overall perform poorly.
---
I was so happy when the agro decks starting cropping up. I really enjoy rez priest  it can be a struggle sometimes but i do love watching all the face damage from hunters being healed back up
---
4 voidlords upgrade to a tier 1 and t2, so you would need 6 voidlords to fill all board spaces :P
---
Shifter Zerus
---
You care way too much about up/downvotes.
---
I keep all my Golden cards. Its so rare to get one, so I would not.
---
But I have 26k dust...
---
One in 100 games is a made up number mate and you respond to me after I said it disagree that it is very rare. It easily happens quite often when you play highlander and you opponents also sometimes play highlander and when you think you can't get to turn 9 with a highlander deck vs aggro often as highlander hunter for example than you doing something wrong. 
---
You assume that every deck vs aggro ends turn 7 lol
---
Just stick to the math and don't make up stuff
---
It is a shifting trick you are missing.
---
the 15 health guy might have just been someone like me who just thought it was fun to co-op with someone in hearthstone and didn't really try to win. I mean there is no other way I think to co-op unless this tarvern brawl.
---
Thank you guys! I took your feedback into consideration and edited the card. It was intended to be only a mockup - I would put only the illustration to my portfolio, without the card design.   
---
How would you change it to be playable in the rogue deck?
---
so how much dust you got then?
---
Thank you for your opinion! I changed the mockup for the blank illustration to make it less confusing. What stats or abilities would you suggest to make it playable?
---
Well 0 now I built the shrivallah holy wraith combo deck with it, still had to disenchant cards I didn't get in the opening
---
I've had good success just winning the board hard enough to race down face hunters with shark galakrond rogue.
---
It would indeed be cool way to distinguish those brave mad lads that are climbing in wild
---
Thank you! I changed the mockup card for a blank card, but I'm curious, what abilities would you like to see for a card with an illustration like this one?
---
I agree the price is too high, but what other card game gets you a meta deck for $40? Games that have maybe 100k worldwide players like Legends or Shadowverse?
---
You know after five attempts at this brawl I understand why blizzard things their playerbase is a bunch of morons.
---
Yeah I feel that way as well but pressing disenchant on a legendary and only getting an epic cards worth of dust just makes me feels bad man
---
Keep! Treants is pretty good and fun to play
---
Considering that Shadowverse cashes in around $40k a month in revenue those are some really rich players.
---
All depends on the format and build

Honestly I am a bit disappointed that there aren't that many interesting, new archetypes. Face hunter, Pirate Warrior, DR Rogue, yeah we've all seen it and played it before. Galakrond Warlock is just Zoo, Warrior is just aggro/tempo, Priest is just bad. New heroes doesn't seem interesting at all. Not compared to the Death Knights. And the best decks are just old decks with few new inclusions. 
---
Really enjoyed playing Highlander Mage, the rest of the decks are boring to be honest.
---
Does pirate warrior run ancharr?
---
Why is this downvoted
---
Well to be fair mage and druid are embarrassingly bad - the rest have op toys
---
You cant judge a person for questioning given 0 prior information.
---
If everything is broken then nothing is broken.
---
not really, before DoD expansion, when an aggro rogue got a Generous mummy of Pharoah cat, when facing Quest Druid, one can just play Generous mummy then. 
---
During then, it is difficult for quest druid to deal with the Generous mummy before it's quest is completed, and risk being aggro'ed down before it completed it's quest, or if it's quest is completed, might still not be enough and would still lose during turn 6 - 8 because of the pressure. Oasis Surger &amp; Hidden oasis may not be enough at certain point of time and certain situations
---
generous mummy is generally a bad card, but it does works in very few cases. xD
---
Did you bm?
---
The lackey battlecry only gets double to two attack. Buff SI:7 once and the shark once each for 2 attack on the shark.
---
Ahhh I thought it was +2 attack and rush I'm just being stupid
---
Jesus, actual complaining about zoolock? I don‚Äôt think zoolock has been unfair in the game, ever.
---
It‚Äôs exactly what the tin says and has at least 70% of the same weaknesses, counters and play arounds as it did 2 years ago
---
With all my bad karma I'm sure it would average out.
---
So... Does that make it fun to play? I main Priest and what he is saying is right. Rez priest is unfun to pilot AND play against. Same with warlock and discard. Just because it is in its identity doesnt make it fun.
---
The point of a legendary is to have a unique effect, so I dont think there is balance to it, certainly an overstated one drop feels like the absolute worst way to do it though
---
Yes but that's not what he is saying.
---
Yes, I hate this thing, too. I love the crazy things happening and then discussing them, and them not accepting ruins the fun.
---
Do like a 4 drop, 1 drops are way to polarizing
---
Okay, got it.
---
A 1 mana 1-4 would be soo op. Or a 0-5 would be cool because it could be buffed for early game board control.
---
Yeah id love to lose to dragonqueen alextraza even more often, sounds exciting
---
Thank you.
---
Any story involving Galakrond Shaman being beaten is a happy one
---
Nat pagle is useful in certain cases. i do use him in my aggro damaged warrior deck.
---
Not a rule. I play on EU and have over 100 HS friends from 3 years of play and if I remember correctly only 2 friend requests were there to tell my life line should end soon and in horrible way.
---
Why wouldn't it? Fair/good stats with draw 3 pirates attached.
---
Hurr durr shaman op blizzard why fix bug that shows a card in my opponents hand totally uncool
---
Don't forget Highlander Mage.
---
Everyone has their own cup of tea. I like playing arena to play slow games, some people like to just stomp on tempo. The developers try to make it so everyone gets a little of their own tea, rn arena is probably dead as they put it on psudo hold with new content.
---
What's wrong with sharing your knowledge? There's also nothing wrong with not, you could just say no. I'm against making a big deal about either choice tbh.
---
Had TWO (yeah, two in a row) that killed my minion that gains +1/+1 every time the opp draws a card... Conceded immediately every time.
---
how would you do your 4 drop?
---
It‚Äôs a crap shoot - sometimes you make a friend other times you end up with some bs about your mother
---
i just thought that a stat monster matters more early cuz you don;t have mana for dealing with it but later on you can just straight up destroy a strong 4 drop later on
---
Are you playing on ladder actively? This meta moves extremely fast. Rez priest is extremely good right now.
---
i got goru off my preorder golden legendary lol, feelsbadman. would prefer other golden legendaries
---
What do you want? Do you want then to completely change the game and the way it's played? Ofcourse with the lifespan Hearthstone has had it'll have to turn to reviving old archetypes through new cards.
---
Absolutely
---
Yes, thats a good thing, letting your opponent be able to actually kill or counter your play is exactly how the game should be balanced
---
People disagreeing about priest haven't been on ladder in last 24 hours
---
He now values deathrattles lower so... Yeah, transform effects are basically never existant in this last patch.
---
The way Arena is now is how people who like draft formats like them.
---
Galakrond Zoolock is a great deck. Handlock is a bit meh but a fair deck.
---
My first teammate literally went face on me the second a party crashed spawned on my side
---
What sort of cards would you like to see?
---
Sounds like you just don‚Äôt like hearthstone.
---
And with cards like Veiled Worshipper they're capable of keeping the pressure on and not immediately run out of cards.
---
You probably didn‚Äôt keep up with the meta, play some ladder and find out what you missed.
---
thank you for repeating what the OP said in a slightly different way
---
Well, it doesn't feel good having to sell fifty bulk mythics, something that you maybe get three of in a box of thirty-six booster packs for around on hundred dollars, to maybe get a Liliana of the Veil.
---
4/8, its like playing a good twilight drake but it being legendary means you can remove the  conditional, can also be slighly lower stats so seems fine

You are welcome, mi'lady.
---
I played Zephrys for 0 (as a rogue) after bouncing it back and got a mind control. Only then did I realize what it meant for my Tess(es).
---
Not the brightest play ever, but the outcome was noteworthy.
---
Ultrasaur &gt; tyrantus&gt; every other card &gt; silverback patriarch
---
I will say, I started a match without reading the description, and when I saw the first message I thought "shit, I probably should have paid attention".
---
It was pretty easy to figure out a second later though.  I feel as though if both players are actually trying to play "right" this was one of the easier co-op ones.
---
Because we've had metas before like that where one deck dominates all midrange and control, so you're only choice (as a non-Shaman) is to go hyper-aggro or a few combo decks. 
---
it's not fun.
---
Thanks! I changed the card mockup.
---
Thanks, can you post the list?
---
no one complaint about box of yogg saron
---
And the 4-2 pirate that reequips it every time. That card is kinda broken
---
Played a Res Priest with Elysianna the other day and it was the least fun I've ever had playing the game. I don't have a problem with the other decks and I play against them all the time.
---
I mean, when a legit winning strategy is to ignore everything and throw your entire deck at face, you know you failed to catch the intellect point.
---
Was no Pinata and Party Crasher on board. Thus why I wrote &gt;Becaus he didn't hit my face **after he killed the taunt** the turn after.
---
Nah. Every archetype has great synergy cards. It's not that crazy. Parachute Brigand is more annoying.
---
It would be bad card design. 
---
If you made it a low cost minion, then it would be played in every aggro deck in existence and would become a very polarizing card ("I drew my good card, now I have a higher W/R") or if you made it too high (8 mana 16/16) no one would play it and it would create awful scenarios where players evolve into it and win games they shouldn't have.
---
Legendary without text doesn't make any sense because raw stats shouldn't ever be tied to card rarity.
---
Climbing from 2 to 10 is irrelevant in determining the strength of a deck. I haven't faced albatross priest yet but there must be a reason its not seen in the mid- high end of legend ladder.
---
Shaman also counters it pretty hard too thanks to zentimo and es/hex.
---
Yeah sure, I just wanted to say that he possibly just realized it after he couldn't hit you even tho there were no taunts
---
Is he a supreme archeologist?
---
Nice !
---
If they did release a bunch of cards that enabled archetypes he'd probably complain about them "shoehorning new archetypes in" or some dumb shit.
---
Finkle Einhorn used to be a 2 mana 3/3, and when i first saw him, i thought he was a collectible card.
---
https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Finkle_Einhorn
---
its good but it's very annoying to play against
---
Taunt Druid is fun af if you play wild
---
I honestly enjoy HS more than ever atm. Last time i had so much fun is when Ike shaman (you know giggling bullshit with minibots, flooding the board) was popular. This time i didn't even buy the expansion pack, i just had enough to make a fun galakrond warrior.
---
For anyone curios:

---
Homebrew Dragon/Galakrond warrior with tons of replayability because it's just so very different when you que up with it. Very tempo oriented, but also very greedy with some cards. Definitly not the best deck you can play but it's certainly very fun.
---
Also blizzard artists uses colors to convey the class a lot. If you haven't put this in a rogue shell, I'd definitely think that it's a warlock card. It has a rogueish hue to it but the common purple screams warlock to me.

Yeah but I'm not talking about magic I'm talking about hearthstone
---
And have also the point that cards we're seeing been played are from the last expansion. The galakrond and all that stuff just seems doesn't exist. Every one that is crying about how ressurect priest has no counter could have more fun playing agains them if the new expansion got balanced cards. Thats it
---
We didn't have a true face hunter since Leper Gnome nerf. That was like 3 years ago?
---
Pirate Warrior was a thing 2.5 years ago.
---
Zoolock hasn't been good since Doomguard was hof'd.
---
4 mana 7/7
---
privius#1842 na 80g quest you go first
---
I mean you just describe was the decks are doing. As Trump said "your deck has to do something unfair" and this is very true. If all classes can do something that's considered "unfair" it's a good thing. Highrolling is in the nature of card games.
---
i have decent wins with Pure Paladin at rank 15
---
quite fun at times
---
but yeah inconsistent
---
great job !
---
Basicly the descent of dragons meta.
---
Me when I try to hint the rogue I had lethal but still lack of some damage:  
---
\*taps repeatedly on the pinata\*
---
RPS-101
---
It's seeing play in legend although I don't know how much.
---
I got crazy lucky with the recent bundle.  I don't track my pity timers, so I really was only expecting to get one (maybe 2) legendary cards. 
---
I ended up getting 5 legendary and 11 epic cards. I have a pretty full collection, so they were all pretty junk legendary cards (one's a had dusted before), but I was pretty amped.
---
* Hireek and Voone (same pack)
---
* Mage Quest
---
* Gonk
---
* Zerek
---
I kept them all this time and still got an additional 1400 dust from all the other duplicates and goldens.
---
May i ask the difference between trees and big trees?
---
Mine crashes or freezes constantly. Any resource intensive animation just kills the program. I know I need a new iPad, but really hearthstone is the only thing I do on it these days.
---
I've switched over to just my phone and it plays a million times better.
---
I was discussing specifically trade rates.
---
Shadowverse offers only a slightly better rate of 2 to 7 when going between cards you do and don't want, Gwent also uses the 1 to 4 rate, and ESO Legends uses the same exact rates between cards you do and don't want expect for Legendaries, which is, sure, a 1 to 3 ratio.
---
Even then, the cost of Hearthstone really isn't that much more than the cost of those other game if you're smart about it, and all of the other stuff you're paying for when paying for specifically Hearthstone that other card games do not have, namely popularity and community.
---
Additionally, being Free to play friendly doesn't mean your game is going to last longer if the recent announcement of ESO Legends is going into a permanent maintenance mode is anything to go by.
---
No. If a deck is 50% OP deck, 40% OP deck counters that lose to everything else, 10% other; then it's still OP.
---
Play sandstorm elemental and play mogu. Mogu got nerfed but I guarantee you it‚Äôs still good against decks that go wide
---
git gud
---
I'm sure you are.
---
Just telling it like it is
---
I liked it better when it wasn‚Äôt an expensive rock / paper / scissor simulator. Right now it‚Äôs all counter queuing as the decks all hard counter each other and basically play themselves. But that‚Äôs what people like I guess - RPS is a perfectly balanced meta after all.
---
Yes that would be what my original message implied
---
Eh I dont see it often I just meant that you play her and get those minions out.
---
In essence they're basically just stats outside of Lazul and Envoy of Lazul being nice for hand info
---
i'm rank 5 in both standard and wild every month, legend occasionally if i have the time. 
---
don't be so quick to shut down people , or the cards.
---
nat pagle isn't useless as silverback patriach.
---
somehow i do manage to utilise him in my aggro damaged warrior. 
---
2 mana draw &gt;1 cards, also a body with 4 health at 2 mana, able to act as a soft taunt, and even trading away multiple small minions if i buff nat pagle with inner fire. 
---
able to also copy with bloodsworn mercernary, plus battle rage. 
---
i did make it work for my own homebrew decks and plays.
---
for the downvoters, doesn't mean if a card does not work for you, or if you do not even experiment with it, or if you just netdeck, does not mean it does not work for others, or useless, or not experimented upon, or its not worthy of other people's fun and self experimentation.
---
On HSReplay Highlander mage has a 49% win rate and is a Tier 3 deck and it‚Äôs the best Mage archetype they list. I‚Äôll be just fine over here where I‚Äôm right.
---
People complain about every deck no matter what the meta is like
---
Lol wut.
---
I just provided you a direct link.
---
Wilful ignorance is a bad look, even for you.
---
VIva La Dort League - 3 Guys 1 Deck
---
I was dumb Patrick yesterday but we still managed to beat it. Thanks, opponent!
---
You want a link? Fine.
---
https://hsreplay.net/meta/
---
Scroll down on that page until you see any Mage deck and tell me what tier it‚Äôs at and which archetype it is.
---
I know, but we can't let the others find out. Let them assume we're just idiots, then our master plan will finally come together
---
Reminds me of a deck I made that I called Shadow Rogue where you would use Elekk and Shadow of Death to get a full board of Leeroy. It was actually fairly decent, would probably be shit now though.
---
Are you that dense?
---
I already linked you Highlander Mage with a 55.8% winrate.
---
How do you even add people you meet in game? You need a player number no?
---
I would reduce its cost to 4. It's like a Chillwind Yeti (4 mana 4/5 without any effects) with an extremely difficult to achieve upside.
---
Btw artwork is just like Hearthstone style. Congrats!
---
And you‚Äôre willfully ignorant, you know I‚Äôm talking about how the class is doing overall, not one specific list.
---
Oh man - this is it! Thank you!!
---
I was all set to type that I've found it to be excellent against handlock, because I hadn't played against a zoolock in so long that I forgot it was a deck.
---
Nef is just a single hero. It‚Äôs fine for one hero to have a strength, especially considering that you aren‚Äôt guaranteed to face him. 
---
But a card with this power would be everywhere. It‚Äôd nullify an entire mechanic, and it‚Äôd make Nef and George useless heroes. That‚Äôs a lot of influence from a single card. 
---
And I see this as making Cobalts OP. It‚Äôd lead to some damn repetitive gameplay, since it‚Äôd be a super strong strategy that lots of people would be running, and it‚Äôd be pretty easy to pull off. 
---
If divine shiels poisonous murlocs are the problem, the solution is to address the dino, not to add a card that completely upsets the balance of the game.
---
It only takes one decklist to be good for the class to be good, LOL.
---
As someone who plays a lot of dota i can promise you this balance idea does not work forever lol
---
Same! All while giving each other "thank you"s and "well played"s
---
If that were true the win rate of mage would be 55%, not 46%.
---
Fuck you, i play this deck if i want to. You don't tell people to go kill themselves because you don't like them playing against cheap decks
---
I dont remember criticising anybody. On the other hand ive been insulted here by some randoms. Just like HS. The toxicity in HS is beyond measure, ya love to see it.
---
When that happens the community cries for a week, "HOW DID TEAM 5 THINK THIS CARD WAS OKAY, WTF THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THEIR OWN GAME, THEY SHOULD CUT THEIR FINGERS OFF IN SHAME"
---
I definitely called that and everyone said I was completely crazy for thinking that a late game value over time card probably wasn‚Äôt great in what was essentially an aggro token deck.
---
Wow
---
I've been finding a lot of success with list like this. Zilliax feels really good in it for the big d embiggen heals
---
It can be high skill and crazy broken at the same time. I also dunno how much skill it needs. I don't think I'm piloting it very well but I've got a decent winrate with it. I've also seen some very questionable plays with it at legend
---
Galakrond and Pirate warrior both eat face hunter for breakfast.
---
Tavern brawl is the main reason I have a 2nd f2p account. when it‚Äôs co op it just makes things way easier
---
And for that line I agree with you, it's always better to spread those buffs because you never know how the opponent will respond.
---
I'm not so sure, I've found him quite useful in handlock. The element of surprise can never be underestimated, either
---
:)
---
this game is not fun anymore
---
They just printed Flik Skyshiv to destroy Shirvallah Paladin, I doubt that you are gonna get lucky with that one. They don't care if there's a card that can ruin an entire archetype/deck.
---
People who play it a lot also know it's not
---
Well if you're going to be like that technically Dragon Queen can give you infinite minions.
---
The murloc shaman is unplayable right now, shouldnt even be on the list imo. I played that exact murloc shaman deck last expansion and i won about 64% of the time, sometimes more. Now its barely 50% and honestly feels like 40% or lower. Its trash and everyone has answers to it
---
I'm playing average of 10 games and climb a rank per day, currently at 1, planning to hit legend tomorrow. IMO the best thing you can do is to change any netdeck to fit your playstyle/meta. I really encourage you to go for face gamestyle, even if you went more tempo/value before (I switched from dragon version). 
---
I REALLY recommend Kor'kron Elite and Bloodsworn Mercenary is an absolute must have. The Kor'kron/Leeroy + Inner Rage into Mercenary wins you the games, if your charger came from Galakrond you hit for over 20 damage turn 8. Also I believe putting Whirlwind or even Armorsmith is bad, but I ketp Acolytes and they are doing pretty well, but not 100% sure about them.

Ress priest &amp; combo priest has always been top-tier decks, at least tier 2. People were just blinded by the low winrates on HSReplay caused by the amount of players trying out the horrendously bad Galakrond priest decks.
---
It's easier to balance 10 spinning plates than 120 bowling balls.
---
CCGs in general are basically extremely elaborate dice rolls. Even MTG, all of your decision making is based on if you even draw the right amount of lands in the first place. The only games that avoided this are ones like Duelyst and Faeria where there are a ton of decisions to make outside of your draws.
---
The only way this would be an interesting card would be if it was designed for hand buff type decks or as an evolve/generation nerf.  Something with zero health but insane power relative to mana cost.  I would still hate to open it in a pack.

What I find odd about this is it's the exact same quest name and reward and yet have a different completion condition. If it would be different if there were more quests like this, but there isn't.

---
we just have to pray blizzard continues to drop crazy power level expansions and not witchwood type garbage
---
Plain code for mobile fellas
---
The meta is pretty good but I feel like Rouge needs a little nerf... it‚Äôs the only class that is REALLY getting on my nerves right now, I see it for about 90% of my games and it‚Äôs always the same net deck
---
Turn 1 Toxic Reinforments turn 2 phasestalker is a huge part of the success of that deck.
---
Sneeds shredder could also do it and works well with doubling summons.
---
This guy is a liar.
---
They are high roll though much less for Pirate Warrior overall though. Getting Toxic Reinforments on 1 and Phasestalker on 2 is a huge boost in winrate.
---
Aviana druid was never really unbalanced, crybabies just can't stand a single viable combo deck.
---
yeah that was it :D
---
We shall see but I would bet anything the aggro meta sees a nerf
---
This is actually a character from the Dragonlance book :)
---
twin tyrant is the only card in arena that matters right now
---
I just hate it when aggro decks are super common. Getting hit in the face for 20+ by a warrior in one turn or the stupidity level of face hunter is annoying.
---
Because you play the Warrior Galakrond on an aggroish deck, and you run out of steam pretty fast, keeping it on the starting hand not only allows you to play it on curve, it draws you 4 cards.
---
Why no Akali, the Rhino?
---
Imagine if miracle rogue could have an insane gadgetzan turn, build a huge board, and drop a malygos combo on the same turn... thats basically what aviana/kun wild druid did. In what way is that not the most insane combo deck (time in the game not withstanding, as snip snap otk on turn 5 is obv way more busted)
---
People aren't complaining about Galakrond Shaman right now. Except maybe about how it was killed with nerfs.
---
I haven't seen anyone complain about Zoolock or Highlander Hunter... I didn't even know Highlander Hunter was a deck until I saw your post...
---
something amazing is the goru buff cant be removed, even if they silence your minions they will still be 3/3's
---
I love these graphs well done !
---
Is there an app for mobile yet ?
---
Regarding the distribution and skew towards the top: maybe some amount of people stops playing after reaching rank 5 (10) is that‚Äôs the reason why the percentage stays the same? Would need the raw data to confirm that I guess.
---
Mutate.
---
A 5 mana 5/5 tech should win you that matchup you're targetting, otherwise it's just total horse poo. No one is going to run Platebreaker unless C-Warr becomes the next cancer deck and even them it's going to be used by limited dmg otk builds so rest easy and keep playing your beloved archetype.
---
Skulking Geist is an autowin against JD and Inner Fire Priest and as such an amazing tech for Reno decks that can't otherwise beat said decks. So Geist &gt; Platebreaker by a mile, no one gives jack shit about stats when they consider to run said tech or not.
---
Zeph is the greatest card ever made and it makes you a better player to play it. 
---
AND somehow with its utterly insane power level, it‚Äôs still FUN overall. Usually cards like that lose their luster but damn is he awesome.
---
if deathwing can servive after attacking you can use \[\[neferset ritualist\]\] to make it 12/12 again

2/2/3 | Battlecry: Restore adjacent minions to full Health.  
---
Its not underrated, its just trash
---
I'm playing it at rank 5 right now. Very fun deck. Mike Every deck it has bad matchups, but most of the time it games feel very winnable.
---
Dog it‚Äôs either a ‚Äúrock paper scissors‚Äù meta or ‚Äúplay scissors because rock sucks meta‚Äù, if a deck is doing good then decks that are good against it will rose unless no decks are, that‚Äôs usually how metas work
---
this is only around rank 10, but I've been playing a long time if that means anything. honestly ago is the good matchup, I face mostly aggro so I've teched my list differently than many of the decks I see on HSreplay. I run double MCT and Scalerider to great effect, double swipe/BEES and zilliax as well. Id say I've won 75 percent of games from rank 18 to 10, if you draw embiggen you almost always win. Once I got double emiggen in my opening hand vs pirate warrior, I played both on T1 to see what would happen and I won, it was close though he had a good start.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The 2/2 discover a spell is great because it gives breath of dreams and embiggen a lot more consistency.
---
I think we will have to disagree because there is no reason to give a warning for playing a deck that is allowed in wild, makes no sense. I think a lot more people play standard legal decks in wild deliberately than you think. 
---
At the end of the day many people deliberately play standard decks in wild and they shouldn't have a warning about doing the right thing to protect other people from making a easily fixable mistake.
---
Resurrect priest is cancer and it's worse than galakrond shaman. Change my mind
---
yeah I should've said that
---
It would make the most sense to mark decks individually as a Wild or Standard deck and have them just auto queue into the right format, but there‚Äôs not much short term financial incentive for them to implement that.
---
This is just a core problem with Hearthstone in general. Control can very easily have unwinnable matchups, but a deck teched almost entirely against aggro will still lose to aggro a decent amount of the time. It's especially bad in this meta where they seem content to have loads of direct face damage available to punish stabilization.
---
[removed]
---
Me too
---
Wash your hands?
---
Duelist was really slept on. The game itself is fantastic, the possibilities were so much different from other CCGs and i genuinly enjoyed it alot. Problem now and also back then was, that the marketing was bad. They never really did good advertisement or promoted the game through streamers, it's very sad actually - Nowdays the game is hardly playable. It's very dead and the publishers announced they wont care for it anymore.
---
It's the opposite from Legion TD. The game needed polish everywhere, it was very bland BUT the promoting went so well, that the first two days of the official beta launch they couldnt keep up with the ammount of people. It had a great start and now... it's dead. They had Forsen, Lyrik, Maxim and so many other different streamers showing it off, and then everyone disappeared in frustration of the 20 bucks they spend for nothing.
---
I've only played about 10 games with Embiggen Druid but I'm 9-1.  The deck is *filthy.*
---
Playing zephyrs on to a board with only an opoonents mechanical whelp and not being offered and silence or hex spells.. think i got an si7 tho..
---
Turn 5??? Lol what? I mean even if your opening hand is like double Biology Project and Psychmelon, you still need to draw Brann and nourish to be able to do that on turn 5. That's like the super mega high roll. I played quite a lot of that deck at ranks 5-2, and while it did warp the meta it wasn't unbeatable by any means. I would lose quite often to Odd Paladin and Freeze/Burn mage, and I think some other decks too but I can't quite remember.
---
I agree that Psychmelon was a problematic card, but that doesn't change what I said about Dirty Rat. My issue with Dirty Rat isn't the balance of the card, it's how its fundamentally designed.
---
Also I would've been so much happier with a nerf to Psychmelon than a nerf to Aviana. Like seriously, making Psychmelon 6 or 7 mana would've been so much better, bc that card is still a problem with Malygos decks and now all Aviana  combos are unplayable.
---
Zilliax has been a life saver multiple times. Get him out for 7 when he's a 7/5 and the agro warriors and hunters cry themselves to sleep.
---
who is that fuccboi in the upper left corner
---
Dragonqueen Alexstrasza needs to be changed so it can't add itself to your hand. When you get that it's just endgame
---
Do it.
---
Well, I found the dumbest post in this thread already. You have no idea how zoo is supposed to be played but yet come to complain about it. Congrats
---
I literally put the justification in the original text.
---
You know I was exaggerating but while the T5 OTK was possible (double Project + Wild Growth is enough to get you to 10 mana by T5), T7 OTK's were common. I know Aligner wasn't the best deck at the time but it was the most polarizing bs in the meta, worse for control decks than Big Priest ever was.
---
I very much agree on your stance about Aviana, I miss playing combo druids. But with Psychmelons strength in drawing your entire wincon, Tog Druid would be overpowered even if Melon's mana cost were higher. That card is some awful design. 
---
Rat might also be bad, but it's the only real tech against combo that we got and while I hate running it in Reno decks I have a hard time hating the card itself.
---

---
The thing about deathrattle rogue and similar decks is that once more people realize it‚Äôs too rng and draw dependent it will be filtered out. It‚Äôs popular now because of the shiny promise of a high win rate, but when people see that that‚Äôs not consistent it‚Äôll dwindle, and i‚Äôd argue that that‚Äôs already begun.
---
You mean those decks people where whiny about and calling unbalanced when they were in the meta?
---
Decklist?
---
Highlander Mage is quite good and Cyclone Mage has seen success in the hands of better players
---
&gt; What the fuck are you on about?  
---
[Look here](https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/310/quest-resurrect-priest#tab=matchups) maybe you need premium but maybe don't use anecdotal results to make conclusions.
---
Mage has done pretty well IMO. It's just higher skill cap
---
&gt;?
---
look again
---
the minion on the right
---
how can Raffam have it?
---
because Curator did  it.
---
Yeah, you pretty much suffer the really bad invoke package in this deck just so you can play Fateweaver to activate your combo.  It's sad how bad it feels to play these cards compared to every other Galakrond class, where even if your invoke isn't super sexy, it's at least reliably doing something. 
---
I'd say most gala priest games I play, the invoke does nothing to contribute to the win.  Hell, it's often even a negative when it's clogging my hand up with crap I'm never going to have time to play.  Feels like they really dropped the ball on this one.
---
This is the new official slogan
---
i havent heard anything sync perfectly :/
---
I'm trying to get warlock right now, I figure 5 ranked wins a day I should get 1000 wins in about 8 months........ :p
---
If you happen to be playing on mobile, restart the game, it sometimes duplicates all cards in your collection so it shows 2 golden cards when you actually only have 1. Happened to me like 2 weeks ago, was so frustrating!
