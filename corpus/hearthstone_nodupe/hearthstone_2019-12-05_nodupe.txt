Probably dead. No one else is going to stop them anyways since the Alliance and Horde are too busy fixing death after sylvanas? broke it
---
---
---
To be fair doubling the invokes are pretty decent for board control, and you don't even need many invoke cards to sprinkle in. Then you tap Galakrond to get 4 8/8's and a 5/2 weapon to push for lethal, and if that doesn't work initially Shudderwock can get you that 5/2 weapon again along with 2 more 8/8's that probably will get you to lethal.
---
So I'm a Yugioh player and we often get the exact opposite criticism. That our card text is too long and needs more keywords.
---

---
I think when it comes to hearthstone they take a really bad approach to keywords. Using keywords *sometimes* but not all the time for the exact same thing. Which is what this post is talking about.
---
Where hearthstone has failed in my opinion is not making wise choices on when to implement these keywords. I absolutely think Recruit should be on the above card. Summoning a minion from your deck is a mechanic that is going to be ever present in the game, like Battlecry or Deathrattle. That said I also think not having the keyword at all would have been perfectly fine, since it doesn't take a lot of words to have. 
---
Basically what I'm saying here is inconsistency is a problem and it shouldn't be written of because new players. Hearthstone even has an advantage to physical games when it comes to keywords since it can display their meaning next to them when playing so new players don't have to memorize them. Lastly I think for the keywords we do have the game could make it easier for new players to understand by possibly having a glossary of some sort that lists all the explanations for these keywords.
---
Ultimately my point is inconsistency is bad even considering new players.
---
Of course you shouldn't use galakrond until you have steam. 
---
The ideal order should be: use everything you have until you run out cards (in hand or in deck) -&gt; the oppo is still alive? if yes use galaktron -&gt; is the oppo still alive after 4 8/8? if yes, use shuddershock
---
Basically avenging wrath for minion removal where RNG is less likely to screw you over
---
No, the packs cost money and this was included for free. There *is* a difference.
---
Terrible.  Insta-dust
---

---
Big priest support lol.
---
Have I miscounted, or is this the 23rd neutral common of this set? Normally there's 22.
---
*####Call to Arms*
---
I think the rush card is so bad (overcosted by 1, whereas the taunt is arguably well statted and costed) that we'll be seeing neutral Invoke cards in next year's expansions, simply because 6 Invoke cards doesn't seem like enough to enable a Galakrond deck. I think Priest Galakrond could be a thing because they have the more usable Invoke cards of the bunch with a Pharaoh Cat that generates a worse-on-average card but has a higher high roll potential and an Assassinate that does the same. 
---
Not losing card advantage usually makes cards stronger by a surprising amount. Assassinate is a 43-45% winrate card by all accounts, but add card generation for no cost and it just might be decent. Pharaoh Cat is a brilliant card played in most standard Rogue decks with about a 53% winrate. As for the taunt, Rotten Applebaum is a 49-50% winrate card with an effect that could be argued to be slightly worse than generating a card. Galakrond's Shield is a fair card, -2 stat points away from vanilla but an upside roughly valued at 1-mana. And there's also a theoretical mana value (1&gt;X&gt;0) to advancing Galakrond, so these cards should all be slightly better still.
---
Galakrond's removal battlecry and the possibility of 10 direct damage from a fully powered Galakrond could possibly put control Priest back on the map. Priest can potentially make a Khartut Defender wall with its new Carnivorous Cube lookalike. These high manacost combos can be alleviated with its "if you've invoked twice" card. Alexstrasza is going to sit on your hand for Dragon synergies. They have earlygame board clears again in the Breath, which could invite Thalnos. Hysteria and Plague. Infiltrator. Randomly generated cannon fodder. It just might be enough.

---
Makes more sense to compare it so supercollider
---
Gotcha. Thank you
---
eh, it's not that the card is inherently bad. It just didn't really do anything that worked with priest. Although if it's generated through Galakrond it wouldn't be bad to play. It's possible they were making cards the last 3 expansions with Priest Galakrond in mind.
---
Magic does it more or less exactly the same as Hearthstone?
---
You have the core set of keywords (charge/haste - deathtouch/poisonous - defender/taunt - etc, etc.) and then they'll have a new keyword or two per set, which eventually rotate out so new players only need to learn the basics, and what is currently in standard.

---
They legally cannot give credit. If they did happen to see this as a custom card they cannot legally make it.
---
It could be better right now, but most of the warlock cards for DoD look solid. This could be the weakest one, and even then it's a much better whirlwind.
---
You get *four 8/8s*. This isn't run in quest, quest is run in this.
---
What part of that was supposed to be  sarcastic?
---
My thoughts exactly! Also, the fact it's an epic means that it completes the whole color scheme with a little bit of purple.
---
Yup, my initial comment somewhere here sees this being used mainly by aggro decks and tempo/lackey decks for the 1/1s. Specifcially for Zoolock, its like adding another one of the 3/3 Evil Summoners for improved consistency in using the lackeys.
---
Yeah sure if you have nothing to do with your other 3 mana cards.
---
Y‚Äôall keep saying this but the game, since it‚Äôs inception, has hired dozens of different artists to draw card art every expansion. The entire set has never in the history of HS has the same style unless you play zoomed out on mobile and only see vague JPEGs of the card art

This in theory lets you have a Turn 3 5/6 Nightmare.
---
When the expansion was first announced, the article on Blizzard's website said they're returning to traditional adventure design i.e not another Dungeon Run. Thank god, that formula got stale with Rumble Run and they reused it twice after that!
---
They can‚Äôt give credit.  The card designers are forbidden from seeing custom cards.
---
One thung is not clear. If I have a board full of wisps, does this spell kill them all? Or only two of them?
---
‚ÄòTiss a card that plays with minion placement, just like the legends have foretold.
---
This is a great idea! Shame they don't have people who'd think the same way in their small indie company.
---
I have a self made Wild deck that I took to rank 5 that is Highlander Elemental Mage. It's early game is a little rough, but mid to late game it's very strong.
---
Better than arcane intellect since it gets discounted by 2 for each treant.

I haven't looked at any of them and definitely won't. Blizzard need to stop this nonsense.

you call that "scorched earth"? It's not like he called you retarded or anything, there's nothing in that comment other than his opinion and explanation about why this new card is better. Don't be a snowflake

Did you win?

Galakrond, Time‚Äôs Conflux
---
I never said that the effect is symmetrical in a practical setting. In fact I explicitly pointed out that players always try to leverage symmetrical effects to favour them.
---
You're disputing an argument I never made.
---
This is it I've peaked.
---
With the weapon swap card (forgot the name)? Yes they can. That doesn't destroy the weapon.
---
I mean you could just not watch Hearthstone streams for 6 days.

If you target a divine shield minion then can it roll one way, then roll back on the divine shield minion?

'Better' is completely false. Unlike Goblin Sapper, this has the elemental tag. Immediately this will always hands down, be wanted over GS when making an elemental deck.
---
Nope, Hearthstone!
---
People are severely overestimating the ‚Äúpower creep‚Äù of the set.
---
Why do you view this as a finisher? The card gives Leeroy a Deathrattle.  Leeroy still needs to die before the two new Leeroys show up.
---
Be aware that iOS is glitched for solo adventure purchases ‚Äî attempting to buy one crashes the app.
---
That‚Äôs 2 cards still
---
It‚Äôs especially odd because IMO this is the effect in the game that needs the text explanation the least. If you‚Äôre trying to target one of these minions with a spell  it‚Äôll be immediately obvious that you can‚Äôt so the text explanation isn‚Äôt necessary. Plus you‚Äôre already hovering over the minion so the text explanation will pop up anyway. Basically you can‚Äôt misuse this effect so the explanation isn‚Äôt super important. 
---
This is different from something like Poisonous which you might end up trading poorly by misunderstanding the effect.
---
I‚Äôd agree with this. Priest has a bunch of situational cards while reborn is mostly decent standalone cards (aside from generous mummy). Not saying that this card is weaker, it‚Äôs obviously still stronger in a Galakrond deck.
---
I don't know, there are a lot of really sub par pirates.

Lol never better. Can you tell I BSed a couple papers in my day? Also did you really ‚Äúread‚Äù it?

Thank you for this!  Had to spend a bit of dust, but had 2 mage quests so figured id give it a try.  won 3 games straight for 120 gold 2 of the games over within the first few turns.  Priest played, resurrected his own rag and mind controlled mine and must have played 10 of the damn things but ended up beating him too.
---
Once it chooses it can't turn back. Too much momentum!
---
Hes gonna take a lot of dmg with that immunity dagger
---
Good luck surviving long enough.
---
Comparing it to Flamewacker is not really appropriate because of how different Quest Mage is played (only deck which includes it) compared to Pirate Warrior. Pirate Warrior has to maintain board control: in aggro matchups it means that you need to establish your dominance as soon as possible and by turn 3 when you can play mech it is very often too late against likes of Even Shaman and Odd Warrior or Odd Paladin as it will be swiftly dealt with as for control match ups, all of them have extremely powerful board clears and game against them is basically a race before they completely shut you down. 
---
With Ship cannon you can coin it out turn 1 and then potentially play 3 pirates on board turn 2 completely taking over a board and dealing up to 6 dmg face just with ship. If you play mech, waiting for turn 3 at best to pump out your cheap  pirates is not viable and then it severely limits the damage it can do as you quickly run out of steam. Ancharr might change it alongside those new 1 Mana Pirates, but in current version it is inferior to Ship in what deck tries to do.
---
As for Paladin, there is extremely toxic Handbuff Mech Paladin, which draws a ton of mechs with Crystology, handbuffs them and vomits entries hand on board by turn 3 making insane boards and then reloading with Divine favour. Arguably just below Odd Rogue and Secret mage in tier 1.
---
Remember when people played games because they were fun? Whatever happened to that?

what are you even talking about üòÇ
---
1 your oppoenent would have to know that happens(i'm pretty most people don't look directly at the enemy's hand while playing)
---
2 it only makes so that your oppoenent can play around galakrond, something they should start doing aniways by turn 6 and ownward.
---
overall doesn't look that bad of a giveway to me, just a nat visual touch.
---
Me too. Taunts to the right. Big minions to the left.
---
It is a miracle to stick any minion on board vs warrior now from begin to the end. Lol
---
malygos is a different story. it's fucking +5 and part of otk. but when was the last time a deck utilized +1 +2 spell damage minions. there are like 2 decks in the history of hs. face spell mage and shaman. and they lived for a very short time.
---
That‚Äôs better I guess
---
Doesn't change the fact that it is not currently a named keyword, and that for more than a year its been called "elusive" on here. 
---
If they had added a keyword saying "evasive" then you would have been right to correct it, as of right now, you're just being a tool.
---
Yes
---
We'll see, but as of right now we're using elusive, so correcting someone is simply incorrect.

I was about to ask whether it'd be available for macOS, so I appreciate the answer.

This looks great, can't wait to use it!

Play right before your druid quest opponent completes the quest, and steal that :D.

It is explained I detail on the fire gatherings website.

KnC will always be close to my heart. It made Control Warlock OP. It gave priest Duskbreaker and Psychic Scream. It made Big Spell Mage into a viable archetype. I thoroughly enjoyed (unnerfed) Call to Arms on my aggro Egg Paladin in wild. Satellite/Spiteful Priest was another great deck that I played a lot back in the day. And Tempo Rogue with Corridor Creepers were disgustingly strong.
---
The Kobolds and Catacombs set and the meta that came out of it were some of the craziest, most overpowered meta in the game.
---
This expansion is legit just custom hearthstone but somehow even more busted
---
Its clearly better than both Shadow bolt and Swipe. Ppl sleeping on this card
---
Warrior now have unbeatable early game for any aggro deck.

Turn 2 new waraxe, turn 3 this turn 4 OP rush minions

It is for you to decide. It's your money.

You can just splash this in to any Dragon deck in general. It seems pretty solid

---
Paladins are also dogmatic. They're willing to use evil/unethical means to achieve their ultimate goal.
---
Not that I disagree, just adding that a LOT of Paladin themed story lines in fantasy are about how their grand lawful good ideals are often betrayed by their harsh lawful evil actions.
---
Garbage
---
A lot of Paladin's archetypes can be argued to overlap to some extent at least, (Reborn and Mech, Secret and Buff, Mech and Handbuff, etc.), or were almost completely player made like Spell Paladin.
---
That's because while the fine focus of each of those specific archetype is different, they're ultimately focused on minions and trading.
---
Even then, Paladin isn't the only class that seems to get a bunch of one off archetypes and concepts. Freeze Shaman, Five or more attack Druid, 1 mana Hunter, Self damage Warrior, Dead Man's Hand Warrior, Spell Hunter, Eureka Shaman, Recruit Warrior, Buff Priest, and so on and so forth.

Invoke uses the Hero power of your deck‚Äôs Galakrond. For example in Shaman his Hero power is summon a 2/1 with rush. So when a shaman uses a card with invoke they summon a 2/1 with rush.

On top of working towards upgrading Galakrond, each time you invoke, you trigger the hero power of the Galakrond you're playing.
---
If you play Awaken in your Galakrond Warrior deck, you'll deal on damage to everything *and* your hero will gain three attack for example.

Really only priest and warlock look different

Ok.  I love this brawl.  I‚Äôm having too much fun playing this Big Reno Mage.  Basically you have a few chances to pull Luna in your opening hand, whether through Raven Familiar or Grand Archivist.

Yes, I agree, this is more like Dire Mole than Mistress of Mixtures, that's my point, Mistress of Mixtures was an excellent one-drop in control decks, especially ones like Renolock, whereas this can be used in a more aggressive deck thanks to its statline.

You play it in a deck where the variance isn't so high. Like \[\[Blatant Decoy\]\] from SoU, you don't play the card unless you're gaining a lot more from the effect than you can reasonably assume your opponent would.

That is blatantly untrue in most cases. The armor break card won't be played unless if armor decks are overwhelming the meta. That's because in most matchups it's just a 5 Mana 5/5 do nothing.
---
Secret mage is currently the only deck that has somewhat of a favorable matchup against SN1P-SN4P Warlock and even then it‚Äôs iffy. The deck has been S+ tier for a very long time and it probably won‚Äôt be going anywhere.
---
Just disenchant all your wild cards and you should be good.

But if you wanna play wild then disenchant them anyways since the only way you win is by playing Sn1p-lock

Because it bears repeating, the proper name for this minion/mount is the *Friendship Birb*.

Please have some custom voice lines against Malfurion or Tyrande, she nearly wiped out the Night Elf race and the two of them have sworn to destroy her.
---
How does it interact with spell damage. Just raw, or will each bounce get a bonus?
---
&gt; The only issue with that logic is that not all ‚ÄúInvoke Galakrond‚Äù effects are created equal. There‚Äôs a big difference between adding a Lackey to your hand and putting two imps on the board. 
---
The rogue one is still on a similar power level to putting two imps on the board.
---
Consider a hypothetical 2 mana 1/1 with invoke Galkarond.  It's +2 mana over base stats (Wisp is 0 mana for a 1/1) so fits the pattern.
---
In Rogue this card would be...EVIL Cable Rat, a perfectly playable card.

Not really. The deck is carried almost solely by the legendary weapon. The moment you can‚Äôt draw all your pirates at once - the deck falls behind really hard.

It think that Galakrond Shaman will end up being it's own version of Token Quest Shaman since it runs a bunch of dudes that spit out 2/1 rush minions. Your goal is gonna be to put dudes on the board and then use Bloodlust. Corrupt Elementalist is a 5/5 and 4 2/1 Rush dudes for 7 Mana that's pretty nuts. Nithogg is crazy if you double it and then don't get board cleared.
---
I feel like any game where you actually play Galakrond is a control matchup you'd probably lose anyway since putting Invoke stuff in is worse than stuff that makes you value, and Galakrond is kinda like a last ditch effort.
---
Burn Quest Shaman also looks really good. Cumulo-Maximus is just 7 Mana Pyroblast. Oh and it's also a 5/5 I guess. Fire Hawk might be playable because it can end up being like a 15/3 for 5 Mana which is an instant win if it connects. Plus you've got all of the burn it already had with Wasp and Lifedrinker.
---
Eh, I still think it's a bug. That visual effect was likely made for the player playing it, not their opponent.
---
I built a malygos druid deck with alexstrasza and my opponent conceded as soon as I played gadgetzan.
---
Yep one of the reasons I stopped playing hearthstone. The Meta was almost decided by the time I opened my packs. That feeling of everyone trying out new decks for the first 24 - 48 hours was gone. Streamers kill it. Even if I don't watch them, others do
---
Just create an own gathering and open the packs by yourself. U dont need people to join to start the gathering.
---
At least Dragon Paladin, a seemingly one and done archetype, got stuff this expansion.
---
Then again, *every* class got dragon support, but still.
---
I should have looked into that, but I think my schedule never matched up with the groups. Congrats on your purple bird!
---
I've always though Krip to be the best, right ahead of trump, but behind toast. and that one goofy kid, thijs or something, that kids a God at hearthstone.
---
The one most people were last playing was mech based right? Which seemed better than the earlier version running less mechs. These new cards slot into later?
---
Just raw.
---
How could I forget? Successor to the Friendship Moose in WoD
---
...I think you need to look up what the meme ‚Äúinvincible‚Äù means.
---
Apparently I‚Äôm a hunter main now.
---
Pirate Warrior support :(
---
Don't most Dragons have a battecry though?
---
You can technically play a few neutral cards, too, and keep these until you draw them. However, it'd be too risky to be consistent.
---
If they add ways to get rid of your remaining neutral cards then this might be a solid deck. I'm thinking maybe something that only draws neutrals or transforms neutrals in deck into random class cards.
---
That way you can play early game neutrals for board set-up/early competitiveness and get rid of them when you wanna turn pure paladin. I'm not good with Warcraft lore but it could be a theme along the lines of "embrace the light".
---
Heyyy somebody who actually read it all! Definitely on the right track, but think more current! Fortune favors the **bold**
---
Meanwhile veressa still rotting as a hunter meme legendary
---
Does the +1/+1 from goru stack if played multiple times? Didn‚Äôt think about doing that until seeing it with sathrovarr
---
In their tongue, he is Dovahkiin...
---
Oh my, you sir are good. I kinda don't know how to play this in Standard tough.
---
Yes, it's a battlecry with a plus stats instead of something like "your treants become 3/3".
---
seriously. This is strictly better. The power creep is completely real at this point. This is better than a card I already paid for. Boo.
---
old card.
---
Yes, it's an absolutely brutal spellwing
---
Does not even have Rush :-(
---
Because some things are still clearly broken and they want all the final testing time they could give themselves. One thing we know is broken is twin tyrant's animation. One thing I suspect, but maybe people who watched more streams could confirm or deny is Skybarge failing to hit face when it should be able to by the text. Regardless of that one being real I'm sure there are other issues they need to make sure are sorted out.
---
I'd rather people just sit around and deck build and talk while playing the current expansion. I'm gonna stop watching any more streamers till expansion day.m to preserve SOME excitement left. Hopefully this stuff gets discouraged so I don't see websites full of meta defining decks day one
---
If(weapon==hunter){
---
         mount=shaman;}
---
Just a tought, but I don't think she will be a Paid hero. They are already milking us with the expac, the new pacs, and the next bundle. I think she will be somewhat freeish. Like Questable or something.
---
You really want to be playing flying machine in mech pally on 3. Also the attack buff doesn‚Äôt do much if you‚Äôre building one huge mech rather than going wide on board. Probably won‚Äôt see play in that deck.
---
It's like PayPal
---
"If you control a pirate, this costs (2) less"
---
Shaw is the leader of the SI:7, the Stormwind CIA, if you will
---
play 30 paladin cards quest, l have this deck called 'Fuckadin' which has nothing but 1-2 costs paladin cards and two 'draw cards until your hand is equal to your opponent's hand.'
---
From what I gather, nothing, like playing double deathrattle weasel. It goes into the opponent deck, and then into yours again. I don't think the second change overwrites the first one.
---
Defile was a customhs card
---
Nah I hope she be a raid boss. As a worgen warrior,losing two homes because of this undead bitch hurt my soul
---
What about above 6k and 7k?
---
I love you too üòòüòò
---
The only times I've taken 1st with Beasts are when I've gotten early Mama Bear,s or tripled the Tier 5 Deathrattle Wolf, or just had an otherwise decent build with two DivineShield/Poison Amalgams.
---
Priest tried this combo for a freaking long time... didn't even worked once i think. Priest has a fuckton of board clears, just not good ones.
---
Well I‚Äôve gotten value from my $10 on Alleria. Took her all the way to 500 wins and guess I‚Äôm ready for something new!
---
Maybe a .00001% chance
---
But that would have been advertised on the preorder page though
---
But but..... Orge Nazism!
---
yeah I pretty much already said this, but the guy you're replying to is so insanely dense it's almost unbelievable
---
Shammy invokes
---
Together with the new card that makes all neutral into class cards, this should be named Clownforged Fiesta
---
I would expect her to be purchasable precisely because of how greedy Blizzard have been this year.
---
Can't really help you there. But, i think there was a time where i won because i "danced" a huge Rat Pack, with assist of Pack Leader. It was fun.
---
Garrosh is a good boys. All he did, he did it for the Horde.
---
That's Priest's Galakrond: Infinite void of time
---
I was pointing out 5/5 is clearly better than 4/4 WITH SPELL DAMAGE, jesus christ
---
Because she's a ranger and uses a bow
---
I don't think having a Dell is considered "Flexing."
---
About time
---
Haha, a golden Jaraxxus! Zephreys offers you a sacrificail pact card if you play it on an jaraxxus opponent. That hero is a demon so you're dead no matter what if your opponent has a zephreys.
---
Shitty meteor?
---
I haven't bought anything on HS since beta, broke my streak with preordering DoD.
---
Control decks heavy in expensive legendary minions literally serve no purpose without the existence of Aggro decks. 
---
I think two factors play into Control players thinking that Control decks are superior:  
---
1. Getting zerged down by a "brainless deck" feels bad, especially when the plays appear so straightforward.  
---
2. Longer games with more cards in hand leaves more options available as a whole, which means you're relying more on decision making than luck-of-the-draw.  
---
There are problems with this line of thinking, however. First, reactive cards in your hand that has nothing to react to are not really options at all. Second, you don't get to see what the other side looks like when it is in a mirror match-up, you only see what Aggro does to you the Control player.  
---
And let's make no mistake. Aggro vs Control is not a brainless player versus a skilled player. It's two brainless sides, because each side knows exactly what they need to do to win as soon as they know what their opponent's deck is doing. Control has to survive, Aggro has to kill. And your decisions always funnel down to doing that to the best of your ability.  
---
Make it a mirror match-up and often Freeze Mage players are using Blizzards on empty boards just so they have space in their hand for their next card draw. And let's not go into how pissed off people were with Archivist Elysiana because games would go on that long and because it boiled down to if you ran the Baleful Banker or not.
---
Compared to Zoolock mirror matches? The situation changes every turn, you're constantly vying for the board, and each draw is ever so important. There are genuine choices to make for when you take the hard aggression approach and let them make the trades, or if you continue to try and maintain board presence.  
---
Aggro decks are much more fun to play for me because they are proactive, and because they have more match-ups that are genuinely interesting. At least I can try and play around or against a Control player's removal to an extent, and it's not exactly "high skill" of them to just, well, have it. But unlike a Control deck, the mirror match-up is generally exciting.
---
I think that still the more midrange decks like Rogue / Shaman (if there will be any) will be including this card like with azure.
---
Oh, I didn't notice it's available already))0) Okay, than my version is wrong. Thanks for noticing
---
It's good to show your gratitude, and the devs do work very hard
---
Sylvanas is such dumb character in its core, it's basically everything...
---
Hunter, Death Knight, Warrior, Rogue, Shadow Priest. Who knows even Shaman and Warlock if the devs feel like it.q
---
&gt;i maintain 4/4 spell damage is better than just a 5/5
---
which you wouldn't if you played in Classic where this was clearly shown to not be true in the comparison between Ogre Magi and other 4 drops (Yeti). must've been before your time.
---
\*Violin

how to get her skin?

Is it possible that we¬¥ll get any free packs as login bonus when the expansion launches? Or through the Winter Veil event?

Antonidas is much more useful than Tirion these times I think

YOU BROUGHT ME BACK!?

Can‚Äôt go face for 8 bad card

Well he then somewhat retconned on it after looking at the sutiation more closely. Like "Ok maybe Immortal would be a good game but I get it that people wanted Diablo 4 instead".

So your not mad, but think people are "whores" (for internet points), but also you think you're just repeating someone else. Utter nonsense.
---
Keywords are mostly expansion specific, with the likes of magnetise, echo and reborn being virtually exclusive to the expansion they released with, so it‚Äôs highly unlikely they would ever do another reborn card in another expansion since SoU is over now

How long have you been playing?

Imagine, you are the graphic designer, who has to prepare the "Technical Difficulties"-Image for the Blizzard Streams.

Oh no you just wrote a comment that makes you a "whore". /s

It's a pleasure to see someone else enjoying these effects for those rare moments and not because it actually increases their winrate.

To me one good wreckage every now and then is definitely worth it.

or play Elemental Mage

Yaaaay

But shit, it was 99 cents
---
But doesn't it make it just a flamestrike on steroids? Just always pick the minion on the side.
---
Thanks for the explanation, I didn't know.

Can you post a histogram of rank distribution?
---
i get you, i dont know what's wrong with this dumb people.
---
I was just hopeful lol. In the passed wording with "copies" or "copy" retained buffs and some got nerfed to "summon another "card name" (forgot the name of the 4 mana 2/3 taunt that summons a copy of itself lol).
---
...that wasn't a prediction. Did you actually read my comment?
---
Choke me, Pally! Oh yeah!
---
Aww look at that chonker
---
To take this screen shot
---
Just wanted to say you've made me love this game more than any other. I started watching you when you started doing Hearthstone and I've learned so much from you. I would not be the player I am today without you! So entertaining and you don't scream constantly like other steamers!
---
Raven wasn't even that good diremole was actually a better card
---
So they did listen to the community. Instead of full blown pre-release event, they got some streamers a couple of hours of gameplay after the reveal stream to showcase some new possible decks. 
---
If you think 5! hours from 10 streamers solve anything meta wise, you should probably stop playing. Imo this was a really good compromise between keeping the meta fresh on release while also teasing us a little with up and coming decks.
---
Damn.
---
As a huge fan of Splintergraft I share your enthusiasm, but have to dissapoint you...  
---
...I've tried Splintergraft in so goddarn many decks and he is always a weak play that could be replaced with better stuff...  
---
The best use for him I found is with the boar, giving you a pyroblast basicly, it's somewhat decent in control decks to throw out as an unexpected finisher.  
---
The problem with Splintergraft though is that he's so goddarn slow and your opponent even knows what slow play you have in hand.
---
&gt; And the it's really kind of silly to declare a card "bad design" when no one's played it yet.
---
Why though? It's not like this card is so novel and weird that nothing can be foreseen regarding how it will feel to play/play against. It's a card that you can play really early on and that alters your whole deck to your benefit for the rest of the game.
---
GrinningGoat probably already have given it a score for their arena tier list.
---
laughs in *the curator*
---
&gt; Holy shit when they came back and it‚Äôs still broken! LUL
---
Well, when "listening to the community" means cutting off an effective and almost free form of advertisement.
---
Good luck getting that past even the lowest, just out of college scrub at Blizzard Marketing.
---
They had to get someone to replace Atheon
---
Anyone wondering what interaction will happen when she plays herself?
---
It must be really discouraging working for blizz and you have this card all set to go and then you see it appear on custom hearthstone by total chance like ‚ÄúWELP, IM NOT GONNA CHANGE IT BECAUSE OF THIS but damn their art is better‚Äù
---
lol had this happen to me. Opponents shudder killed my 1 health Sylvanas and then his Shudderwock had a change of heart.
---
It is a grindy deck, sometimes, but it has insane burst.
---
Lol you deserve for bming
---
With charge
---
For quite a while there was a good control shaman running the quest. Instead of winning in 10 turns, it won in 25, but still won.
---
Doesnt seem likely considering the power level of the expansion I doubt they care if priest is ever so less likely to get another pws
---
Nice.
---
Fuck the horde. FOR THE ALIANCE!
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
You might as well compare it to Sprint with that comparison. The cards fill completely different purposes. Novice Engineer is "Well this is as close I can get top running a sub-30 card deck." This is like Azure Drake, which you play to help to curve out.
---
She may not be a Mary Sue, but damn if she isn't written like one, even in the parts that are written well!
---
when a DS is a one hit wonder, and one hit is 1 dmg, it doesnt make sense that if it hits a DS it looks for health of the non-DS state and not the health of the DS.
---
The trade off should be you are taking Face damage instead of losing your minion.
---
Where do you find this data?
---
Would you rather this one also be locked behind a 60 dollar pre-order paywall?
---
sure they are.
---
They browse reddit just like anyone else.. and how else do you explain almost carbon copy effect that people have posted on CHS the last few years in this set?
---
Hey baby are you slyvanas cause I want to have sex with you
---
you forgot floop. Goru into floop.
---
The next expansion is so over powered it will obliterate the current meta in standard, so it‚Äôs a great time to return. Everyone will be starting with new decks.
---
He wouldn‚Äôt be quite so slow if he gave you a 0 mana 10/10 mulch muncher. But... yeah possibly too slow still
---
Your argument doesn't make sense. Shadow Word Pain can only be used in one class and only trades 1 for 1, so it doesn't generate any card advantage. And usually not tempo, sense you'll likely use it a 2-3 drop which likely has some effect outside the body you destroyed.
---
Goru the Mightree
---
boomship for poor people.
---
That was pretty good.
---
Also when is the SN1P-SN4P nerf coming out? I'd like to enjoy the new cards if possible.
---
&gt;So either no one, or everyone was infected.
---
That's actually wrong. The grain had already been distributed so if not all at the very least a majority of the villagers were infected. In the actual campaign mission they all turn into undead as soon as you reach them.
---
Safe earlygame for 0.1%. I'd pick Brann everytime.
---
Nope, it's 3 witchwood apples.
---
And yes there have been instances of armour cards:
---
\- Plated Beatle
---
\- Gluttonous Ooze
---
\- Half-Time Scavenger
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
No I haven't forgotten Kharkut Defender. But it did not come out this set. Which is why I made this post.
---
Jesus Christ how plainly do I need to spell out my posts, in what world would I not be talking about DoD release?!!
---
Renounce darkness!
---
Will garden gnome trigger off of a discounted Aeroponics?
---
This hurts me in the most hilarious way.
---
Who even needs the Druid quest and Oasis Surger when you can just put in Galakrond and Dragons Pack into your deck?
---
Depends in your phone i guess. I usually get around 30-40s but occasionally 15s when the round takes a long time.
---
I think Aggro Priest will be tier 2.
---
Screwjaw clunker approves.

2/2/3 | Whenever you draw a card, transform it into a random Legendary minion.  
---
Uhh, you know what piexlated means, correct? Because left card isn't pixelated at all. If anything, right card is.
---
It's less that paladin is dying and more that it never seems to get consistent themes. 
---
Most classes usually get 2ish distinct archetypes pushed in a given set, but paladin has been a bit all over the place. Like last set in Uldum they got some seemingly random 1 health synergy, a quest with reborn synergy, and a couple reborn minions, an expensive murloc spell and a murloc legendary that initially seemed like it had anti synergy with murloc decks, but it turned out being a murloc river crockolisk was good enough most of the time. And a few other somewhat general spells.
---
Now this set some we have some "low" cost dragons, the breath spell and a legendary that works with dragons. The other legendary is a dragon, but more supports a big type deck when no other paladin minions in the set are great for that type of deck. You got a sidequest and a minion with a swarm theme. The other sidequest exists. Then there's the 2 card pure paladin support.
---
None of this means paladin will be bad, but it's been pretty thematically all over the place for a while.
---
Well, listen to your friend's advice in the future. This time, however, you should be fine. Splintergraft won't fit into this deck.
---
Touche
---
and shadowform
---
To ruin the opponent's gameplan? More like yeah! However, is this working?
---
Most deck have trouble to sneak in more than 1 tech card. Silence , the dragon poacher and weapon destruction will be the prefer tech choice of the upcoming meta. Only damage-based combo deck will include that card to deal with CW, but that only a small amount of encounter on ladder 
---
And , no aggro deck will use this card. If you let Warrior pump up armor it means you lost the board and you lose the game already at that point
---
For me it was really just evolve and N'Zoth. 
---
The rest were fine and fun to play with.  They didn't warp the meta in a horrible fashion.
---
Same.
---
I guess I can see the rationale. Hopefully the invoke minions will be sufficient to help keep aggro from rolling over quest shaman early game if it's going to be played.
---
You want to try looking for triples. You can roll aggressively but never at the cost of your board state being superiorly underpowered. If you feel you're above par from most of the lobby, reroll for a turn but if you're at a low health total, just buff and stabilize.  I'm at 6500 so I'm no pro but that's the way I generally play.
---
But, its garbage :(
---
Ooh
---
I hope more classes get "no neutral cards" cards

Hey vvstrafeyoo, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
Just kill them 4head
---
It‚Äôs not cut and dry what you triple and what you don‚Äôt. The general consensus is you take early triples you can pick up for the quick power boost they provide, along with getting a higher tier unit, so combining at level 2 for chances at stuff like Cobalt Guardian or Pack Leader, or level 4 for Brann etc.
---
Past that, there‚Äôs specific units you generally shouldn‚Äôt, for example Amalgam might seem good to triple but you don‚Äôt get anything except +3/4 on him. You‚Äôd be better off either keeping 2 and buffing them separately or staying at one and not using 6 gold for a +3/4 buff.
---
The main ones you definitely want to 3* are people with effects that allow you to boost their value greatly. Stuff like Scavenging Hyena, Baron Rivendare, Crowd Favourite, Wrath Weaver.
---
Not an issue but still powercreep

There also eas a ‚ÄúHunter‚Äù hunter aka spell hunter. It was made out of class cards only

I hate that I came here to type this same comment, WORD FOR WORD. Reddit really reminds you how unoriginal you are lol.

I actually love the added class identity of it.

It's simple. I play Barnes. He summons Blood of the Ancient One because he's the only creature in the deck. I play Grave Rune and then Shadow Word: Death. I summon the Grancient One!

They swap HP,  the druid finishes his quest which replaces the HP and then it swaps back leaving the Shaman with the Druid's quest reward
---
This is peak Hearthstone card art. Not a joke, it's great.
---
Probably for more general, human rights-y reasons.
---
Why would it be? I only consider it to be a bit of a douche move to play full meta decks at rank 50-25. Otherwise paying to win is not really a thing in HS.
---
We won't know until people start playing the new cards. It looks like Pirate Warrior would get a lot stronger in Wild. As will many midrange dragon decks. And also some Reno decks.
---
I started playing during gadgetzan (~3 years ago) and you couldn't get him, so I don't think most people have him
---
My guess is after today's patch it will be there
---
But having to play a specific legendary to feel good about playing your spell means it has to be a very slow and control-heavy deck.
---
It will if your board is clear
---
Get good at arena

Dragon breath is better than decent, volcanic potion was played in most of mage decks, this is even better.

---
I can't recall all of them but I got first place with the so-called bottom tier heroes multiple times. The brick guy, gallywix, patches and the queen togwagsomethingsomething. Never drafted nefarian or shudderwock. Always lost with George haha.
---
I was pretty vanilla and just built an astral druid deck, minus astral communion.
---
I knew there was a reason not to disenchant that card
---
I‚Äôve experienced it, you can still attack the hero just the immune outline appears
---
Yeah but that's American censorship.
---
No he wasn't, you need to read actual lore. ''Arthas Rise of the Lich King'' had him push Ner'zhul out of the Helm to put himself in charge. The Sword only took his soul it never mind controlled him.Sylvanas was twisted and is still is, by him. He destroyed her soul she isn't just a ''free willed undead''. So nope you're incorrect.
---
I realize you won't care though, Arthas and Garrosh stans unironically are the type of people who say that ''they did nothing wrong''...because they're dudes or something.
---
Didn't get the name right, they suck. /s
---
Not for long my friend, not for long
---
Nah fuck China for their new holocaust
---
Something like 32/130. Hard to really treat it as meaningful when I honestly have no idea how many games total I've played.
---
80 gold off the brawl alone yesterday, overall I have close to 4k. Won't be a lot of packs which is a shame cause Descent of Dragons is a dope set from what I've seen.
---
No I was unable to attack him
---
He means that Jaraxxus can be tricked out of your hand onto the battlefield. He can literally be played as a minion.
---
Well, I guess it doesn't matter since event cards rotate today
---
Now this is a playable hunter skin !! Alleria and the 1000 wins Rexxar one are terrible :(
---
Idk, taking the prize money of the championship winner and firing the 2 casters who didn't do anything wrong doesn't seem like the right thing to do...
---
Plays the same like it would in regular games except turn 1 Tip the Scales is pretty nutty. It's disgusting but it works and allows for playing a whole lot more matches in the time it would take to play a regular game, so this Brawl is like a godsend for me.
---
Take my upvote young one.
---
That's hilarious, good observation OP.
---
hold up, does it mean this can be an anti hero card tech? As it prevents your opponent from playing their hero card?
---
That book got retconned years ago, play the damn game instead of relying on your fanfic. In warcraft 3 they literally tell you the LK made him insane, and in wow his last word are "is it over father ?". Does that sound like the kind of thing someone who destroyed an entire country willingly would say ? Like I said Arthas was a bad seed and a terrible paladin but he would never have destroyed his country without the LK's influence.
---
I'm not picking the hero with the most boring power nice try
---
Thought#2238 trade quest EU. You go first.
---
You are actually so fucking insane and brainwashed there's no point responding to you futher. There's no fucking point. You're a lost cause.
---
Thanks, do you have a link/source?
---
You are clearly not reading what I'm writing. Or not willing to understand it. You should probably distance yourself from this discussion.
---
I just pick patchwerk to end up top 4. Same goes for the secret guy, i just spam ice blocks. Kinda lame but hey thats what theyre good at.
---
Hah mate, I've got 164 ;)
---
Yeah it was Morgl.
---
Woah. I guess I need to catch up on the storyline. Sylvanas was one of my favorite Warcraft characters, right there with Illidan.
---
All patches for Hearthstone are launched at 1 PM EST/10 AM PST.
---
There's supposed to be an announcement regarding Tyrande today
---
Y‚Äôall acting like this isn‚Äôt a 3/3/4 elemental.
---
I thought the broadcasters WERE the production team?  I thought it was relatively a low budget covering of the tournament.  Did I read incorrect information?  Any clarifications are appreciated.
---
Your girlfriend is a Goddess
---
Wait they‚Äôre doing another one? They gotta be really careful with shaman...
---
Ummm you know how this works right? You steal their OP hero power. You then change your hero power, so they get a different one back at the end of the turn. 
---
That's why you don't want to give them shadowform for 3 mana... it's just shadowform is a more consistant way of doing it.
---
Your printer was drunk ? :p
---
GJ ;)
---
They need a better gaming chair.
---
None of them are beasts though, dire mole was that much better than the other cards, because it was a beast.
---
This art doesn't seem to be re-used, ie doesn't exist elsewhere.
---
Magni,Alleria,and Medvih are supposed to be rotating out at year's end. So I imagine, Tyrande, Sylvanas, and a third hero will be replacing them in the store.
---
I loved the card and it could carry the game vs taunt warrior.  I wanted it to be good.
---
If the second copy could have just made it +3/+3 it might have had a chance.
---
Yes thats perfect
---
1. Brawl
---
2. Whirlwind + Plague
---
3. Whatever deathrattle died for n'zoth
---
So which version do you prefer?
---
Not him but I have a current gen flagship model, game runs smooth as butter.
---
Sorry for my ignorance, can someone please explain what will happen here?  EILI5 please.
---
Slightly different, but it's got the same overall pattern - face approximately the same size, looking either to the left side of the card or directly at the camera, neck/torso extending behind it and off to the right side of the card.
---
The warlock one seems to have the full shoulders/(torso?) which faces the frame, and the face is much smaller and facing to the right side of the card.
---
Played with Big Druid.  MAde sure to have a beefy taunt and Aviana, and hoped they didnt have hard removal.
---
Playing 60 mana's worth of stuff in one turn made the guy ragequit.
---
He is just getting closer. Hope's end inevitable.
---
**C H Y N A**
---
There is always *that one* in every family) It felt unfair, not giving him a spot.
---
The SN1P-SN4P nerf? C'mon...
---
Yeah, they're only giving us 6 free Legendaries in DoD, not nearly enough.
---
I'm reading it just fine. "You're not allowed to call anything that you didn't personally grow up around wrong because you just don't understand it". Yes, I fucking am, especially when that thing involves human rights abuses you fucking absolute degenerate moron. 
---
Human rights abuse? Man, they're just different, you don't understand, you're not allowed to hate their government for that. Go fuck yourself
---
Ye I corrected myself up there
---
Evasive Drakonid is potentially good.
---
Terrible human rights record. Terrible animal rights record. Country where old fat chinese men take voodoo supplements like horn of a rhino to get an erection. FUCK CHINA.
---
rafaam is The Supreme Master of Evil and Archeology and Also Sick Outfits^TM so it would make sense his galkarond would be different
---
And that's not what I'm saying. I never said that you are not allowed to call it wrong. 
---
I said that you should not hate and villainize them for it. Like I said in a previous post: You can disagree with someone without demonizing them. You can try to change someone without telling them how terrible they are.
---
Acting out of spite and hatred will never result in something positive. It just makes people act like fascist assholes.
---
I'd play all of them personally...
---
Maybe that‚Äôs why you are taking so much damage.
---
I open a golden one and want to dust him so bad I'll wait tho.
---
r/waterniggas are the true and only water sub
---
As /u/mindcopy said, the right image is blurry, not pixelated. The left image is clearly suffering from the kind of compression you'd see in a gif. If you zoom in on the left image you'll see loads of solid-colored squares in any dark area.
---
Because they were summoned and are on the board?
---
Lmao you‚Äôre invited ! But idk if that‚Äôs possible .
---
That would be a nice custom hearthstone card, since the War3 hippogryphs were so iconic with their mount/dismount ability. 
---
How about Hyppogryph Rider
---
4 mana 2/4 Rush
---
Battlecry: Deal 1 damage to any target.
---
Deathrattle: Add an Elven Archer to your hand.
---
maybe I don't understand, but you didn't answer the other guy's question: why wouldn't the opponent just wait an extra turn to finish the quest at which point the hero powers would just rotate back to normal
---
Neon you're doing the work mate. Really appreciate it. BTW do they pushed the update?
---
What if I told you that she is actually a tree?
---
*anyfin goes
---
What are the cards in that? I‚Äôm on mobile so I can‚Äôt zoom or anything
---
With the way BGs work, in this situation, putting in more weak minions isn't going to save you any damage. Two 2/2's isn't going to do anymore than one 2/2 against a 5/5. Hence the entire purpose of this post.
---
Dragon reno priest in wild.
---
Thanks! it should be live in 16 minutes.
---
His appointment to have the expansion should be finalized within the week. I've already discussed the matter with the Senator.
---
Literally unplayable!
---
Checked and I'm actually 33/133. 5932 rating atm, but climbing steadily.
---
If you already own here you probably get nothing extra
---
In this scenario, you're playing as the druid with the quest at 3/4. You play the card that swaps hero powers for the turn and still have mana left over. When you end your turn, the quest would complete and replace your current hero power, which is the opponent's original because the hero powers swapped. Then the hero powers would swap back, giving you the original druid hero power and your opponent the quest hero power.
---
glad you liked it.
---
That‚Äôs bullshit
---
If I open ancharr imma play pirate warrior
---
Every expansion makes a few cards irrelevant through powercreep and the like; but this isn‚Äôt going to be too bad, that doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt expect DoD decks climbing really high and being meta either.
---
There's a chance the swap-back effect is idempotent, like echoing ooze's original self-buff (which wasn't initially affected by Brann Bronzebeard). I would bet not, but we'll see.
---
Edit: Apparently the echoing ooze/Brann interaction was changed at some point. Edited for accuracy.
---
I don't have enough mana!
---
Dire mole was the definition of power creep in an expansion that many regard as one of the most blatant in contributing to power creep, so it‚Äôs far from the best card to set as the baseline for what constitutes power creep. It‚Äôs better to compare cards to basic/classic when talking about power creep or at least cards in standard. However, this new card isnt contributing to power creep nearly as much as the comments are making it out to be.
---
33?! Damn we can't be friends anymore
---
I'm about the same MMR, I hit 6100 last week then fell back to 5500 after a streak of bad RNG and shit decision-making, then finally made it back to 6150 last night!
---
God, they'll be resurrecting them while we're still chewing through the first six.
---
Not heh greetings. It's

LOOK UPON ME, THE ASPECT OF DEATH.
---
cause u know if/how they gonna monetize it?
---
 nah lets go ahead and paint the devil on the wall.
---
The "bonuses" are a part of that service, it's part of what is paid for.
---
AH yeah that makes sense.
---
I have this card but i never used it. It's golden too
---
Thank you!
---
Like Unstable Evolution?
---
I think this is a really elegant solution. Fixes the issue without touching snip or mechwarper.
---
This is approximately two and a half times more stuff than I was expecting.
---
What? any info on those cards?

Wild Packs for gold, adventure with new cards mid expansion and snip snap
---
Actually a great update
---
They didn't give any compensation for the changes to Sonya and The Cavern Below, let's not forget.
---
Rez Priest might be a thing, especially if there are really fast aggro decks our there.  
---
With the new "summon two copies" deathrattle spell they can keep the board clogged with wave after wave of Reborn Taunts and Zilliaxes.
---
Chadgar
---
I thought we would be able to by the packs with gold to unlock after the expansion releases.
---
nah i looked over your other comments in this thread and i have decided to cut my engagement.
---
have fun with the brainworms though, friend :)
---
It is like old adventure model, you could buy wings for money or 700 gold and they gave extra collectible cards for completing them.
---
So if you drew Sn1p-Sn4p with a card like the Rogue Galakrond, it'll be 1 in that case? It's unfortunate in a scenario like that if you ask me, but I guess it has to be done.
---
Or this expansions attempt at freshening the meta halfway through.
---
I think most of us thought the secretkeeper and jaina changes were dumb
---
Well atleast wild meta will also change from Mech paladin or secret mage and reno decks... back to pirate warrior and odd rogue. ugh.. Im going to puke already.
---
Why are you here consumer slave? Your today's shift working for blizzard already over? 9-5 for dust.
---
It wasn't free. It was a Twitch Prime perk. You had to pay for twitch prime to get it.
---
who said you had to buy it? u literally know nothing and u already decided how to feel about it.. stay classy reddit
---
And some extra nerfs for cards that were never fair in standard or wild (I'm looking at you, Explosive Runes)
---
Ahahahaaa.....HAHAHAAAAHAAAAA THE FOOOOLS! I use glinda only for a meme mogu deck that isn‚Äôt even good! Rewarded for my chicanery!
---
He's terrible.
---
Lich on the other hand now looks pretty sweet.
---
You completely ducked the point /u/thefarrside was making. You didn't have to pay for Tyrande, because you didn't have to pay for Twitch Prime. And even if you did pay, you didn't buy Tyrande, you bought Twitch Prime. 
---
Skins are not meant to be reserved for some elite portion of the Hearthstone community who deigned to use a free trial two years ago. And if you're upset that's not the case, that's a personal problem
---
You are very right! I am loving the new team right now, it really shows that even if Activision and Blizzard can be greedy, they can also do great stuff for the community! It's just really refreshing to see that something I have been waiting for, for so long, is finally going to become a reality.  
---
I have 20k gold, just for this day :)!
---
They just said, that she‚Äôs coming on December 10th:)
---
&gt;Bloodfen Raptor gets powercrep literally every expansion. Like, a legit upgrade with the same stats and an added effect on top and even tags. 
---
No one ever played Bloodfin Raptor. The classic set itself includes what? Fifteen objectively better versions of the card?
---
You cannot power creep cards that never saw play to begin with.
---
&gt;Old cards that can compete with the new cards are either nerfed like Fiery War Axe or rotated out like Power Overwhelming. 
---
The Classic and Basic sets *should and need* to be on average weaker than Expansion sets if keeping Standard fresh is your goal.
---
The best way to use the Classic and Basic sets from a design perspective is to have them fill the holes expansion cards leave, not have expansions fill the holes in evergreen sets.
---
Fiery War Ax could be argued to have been *the best* and perhaps most flexible  card in the whole of Hearthstone. A card of that caliber *should not* be allowed to be evergreen.
---
&gt;And the old nerfed cards often become straight up uplayable. Starving Buzzard is still a joke after all these years. 
---
[Not every card can or should be good](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/when-cards-go-bad-2002-01-28)
---
&gt;Then you have cards like Equality and Nourish being harshly nerfed, cards that were never a problem in the past 
---
Both cards were nerfed not for being too strong generally but potentially breaking a class' identity (Equality enabled Paladin to have a four mana complete board sweep or a six mana one sided board sweep) or enabled Druid to power out ten mana cards like Ultimate Infestation by turn six too efficiently. it didn't help Nourish's chances when one of its options was already an on-rate effect and ramp being restricted entirely to Druid as a class.
---
&gt;No one would run Nourish if Ancient of Lore still drew 2 
---
If Ultimate Infestation was Standard legal, they would.
---
&gt;btw, that was somehow too overpowered and bad for the game but now we have a 7 mana body that draws DOUBLE that ammount and it even expands your handsize limit for whatever reason 
---
Yeah. Ancient of lore and the new Warlock Legendary are exactly the same except:
---
1. Draw is inherently more valuable to Druid than Warlock
---
2. The new Warlock legendary minion WILL rotate out eventually
---
3. Legendary cards are allowed to do more than non-legendary ones since you can only play one in a deck
---
Personally I'm against the nerf. Hearthstone has always been a game of risk management, and the deck fits Warlocks class identity perfectly. Just think about it, letting players dip into the forbidden arts for infinite power at the risk of being smited by the Divine god known as "Blizzard auto-detection". It was truly the peak of Hearthstone and I'm sad to see it go.
---
Tomorrow around 7
---
I don't care about SN1P-SN4P, I care about my easy dungeon runs being nerfed.
---
No more infinite Sound the Bells :-(
---
And all people did was make a prime trial and they got it for free.
---
Hell yeah it is, I want more stuff and I don‚Äôt want to wait 4 months each time for it. I got the money, being the content
---
God bless capitalism
---
Was that a real debate?  I thought it was common sense to discover the 4 first as it has the most late-game potential, then see if you can get a 3 that supports it.
---
The new minions shown in the article are the golden versions, they showed the non-golden versions in the update teaser a few days ago.
---
Watcher will be a t3 4/4 that gets +2/+2
---
You have to have atleast 10 DoD packs acquired before you can access that..
---
As a fan of Dick Dastardly and Skeletor, I can proudly state that I will be fighting for EVIL in the upcoming battle.
---
Voljin just polluted your rez pool, both Pomp and Mass Rez'.   
---
Words dealt with single minions, Mass Dispel/Hysteria and Lightbomb dealt with groups, Waterbearers kept you alive; then you brought in Infiltrators and Khartuts, rezd em with Pomp, cleared late game with Plague, dropped your Hakkar, used Mass Rez, Nzoth/Elys, Seanced one or both of em if they weren't cleared, maybe got some ticks off Emperor along the way, and that's it.
---
Nothing is acceptable these days.
---
And now he's nerfed to oblivion.
---
It means the expansion after DoD. Currently, yes, it is only with ore-purchase, but it will be able to be achieved with packs bought by gold. I can understand the confusion though!
---
Whatever tickles your pickle bud. Learn what racism and a racist remark is while you're at it.
---
i want azshara or kaelthas still. Or thalysra for mage.
---
Its been 5years and still no kaelthas!
---
The whole thing is a meme, there is no expectation for this to be viable. I was just explaining it for people who didn't get it.
---
Guaranteed legendary? As someone who plays fairly casually can you explain?
---
https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23239986/hearthstone-update-december-5-descent-of-dragons
---
They implemented that a while ago
---
Snip snap nerf finally
---
blog post   
---
Probably yes, because Witch's Brew and Unstable Evolution are not in the list of refunds.
---
a joke that everyone here mistook as truth because they're so far down the sinophobe rabbit hole.
---
Why would they advertise getting 7 packs worth of cards though, when the current adventures give 16 packs + a golden pack?
---
**EDIT**: Oh, and Cora [confirmed that they are in fact new cards](https://twitter.com/songbird_hs/status/1202653779998298112). Seems like we‚Äôre getting OG adventures back! 
---
You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd make a bigger deal about it though, considering that this is probably the biggest news here.
---
Ah! A real Blizzard employee responded to my post. I feel so special. 
---
Thank you for the quick response time! It really shows you guys care and I'm glad to know that you're fixing even the small stuff :) Excited to play the new expansion!
---
If that's the case, that's awesome. I love when they add new cards outside expansion moments, and they have added a few recently. But I didn't think they'd do something this significant
---
&gt; Why is powercreep bad for CCG? Business-wise, it's good because it forces people to buy the newer versions of the card, over and over again. However, balance-wise though, you should just bring the older cards up in power so they can compete with the newer releases, so there's an option of picking one over the other for whatever reason.
---
Ok im done, bye
---
This update is just full of great news. Wild Packs for sale, Tyrande for free, balance changes to Battlegrounds, nerfing Snaplock in Wild, removing the Wild Cards from Standard, new heroes coming...
---
Just great all around. Good stuff.
---
It's about how hard you can *get* hit, and keep moving forwards. That's how winning is done!
---
In the first 10 packs of a set you buy, you are guaranteed to get a legendary in one of those packs
---
u and the 10 other people who use it?
---
The worst expansions for me were Karazhan &amp; Un‚ÄôGoro. The card art was just ***far*** too childish &amp; cartoony. Luckily the Hearthstone team diverted course from making that the new ‚Äústandard‚Äù for card art going forward, and have instead only allowed more cutesy stuff to have a marginal presence for low cost minions. 
---
Frankly, having played since Blackrock Mountain, there‚Äôs never been a meta I didn‚Äôt enjoy. The closest I came to not enjoying one was during whenever it was (I‚Äôm starting to forget names of things) that Jade Druid was a huge new presence. I believe it also coincided with Keleseth? Which I also didn‚Äôt care for. Or maybe that was two separate time periods.
---
You play in unranked though, just concede and try again ;)
---
But like for how long were they publically saying "We'll give it away someday"
---
Two years?
---
**The Arena draft pool has been updated**
---
Does that mean you can play the new cards in Arena as of now?
---
 Where is khagdar
---
Wow.....
---
Edwin seems like Daryl. 
---
Also I‚Äôm pretty sure the versions of the new cards coming to the Battlegrounds are the golden versions.
---
There‚Äôs going to be a lot of games where your hydra will hit a divine shield amalgam and you‚Äôll get a free brann or Lightfang that was used to protected the big minions.
---
0 the first time u play it, lowest possible echo off it is 1.
---
With Kaelthas coming back in WoW, I wonder if they want to capitalize on a redesign or something to hype him up.
---
When does this come to iOS? Didn't read it in the update
---
I'm watching someone on stream play with the patch. Maybe PC only right now.
---
They purposefully don't reveal a time in any announcements. It creates an expectation that they might not be able to follow through on.
---
The forum posts that have "typical" release schedules are the most information you'll be able to get.
---
Unnerf+ Hall of Fame Mana Wyrm please.
---
Zeta was pretty upset because there was no more turn 5 reckless -&gt; eggs combo
---
It is true! I'm very much looking forward to seeing all the "Rafaam gave me this triple" posts.
---
[Every one stay calm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObWrdYQ_6xY)
---
I don't have snip snap. If I craft him now, can I still get the refund?
---
I meant whether the free promotion sticks around for more than one day.
---
The common sense was to go 3 first to avoid cases like where you get microbots/annoy o module on 4 without a mech. Plus you have more build around cards like soul juggler, cobalt guardian and pack leader on 3. Basically you can pick minion type on 3 and buffs on 4.
---
Sagrav#1966 - Trading 80g quest on NA.
---
Chill out... you will be able to buy the packs with gold to unlock your stats in a whole 5 days.  God forbid they make any money off of their product.
---
But it's a 2 card tech. You don't always play against Quest decks, and even then you have to draw both of them. There will be probably some Trolden videos with it, but I can't see it being meta.
---
He has a good aggressive body for its cost and tutors the remain card draw/generation if you missed it before. Also you are less likely to draw garbage after.

or both
---
honestly i expected azshara with her raid coming out and possibly hots aswell(her vs blackbeard could be good event there).
---
azshara and kaelthas are weirdest that we dont have yet i feel like.
---
like hamuul is relativly populair but nowhere near kaelthas(or sylvannas theyre releasing soon),or azshara who aslo had her own raid and has been around for ages now.
---
This is expected right now. The Pre-Release Fireside Gatherings are [scheduled to begin tomorrow](https://news.blizzard.com/hearthstone/23229042/). 
---
&gt;Pre-Release events will take place the weekend before Descent of Dragons goes live, **December 6 ‚Äì December 9**.
---
An odd choice. What do you do when priest has no good decks?
---
Seriously, they give and we ask, they give and we ask
---
New one and the old one is both boring and repetitive garbage
---
But the old one is a tad bit better
---
This also kills the unpopular Highkeeper Ra Combo in wild, there are still way to make it work but not in one turn
---
For Priest and Rogue I feel like they could probably get away with only having their galakronds at level 2. Although with Rogue it would semi-depend on how much they need all the cards to be 0 cost. The claw is nice, but Priest's galakrond feels more like a "Play when you can" with the battlecry making when you can a lot easier. Rogue galakrond is also just a tempo bomb which is great at level 3 but doesn't need to be at level 3. 
---
Warrior on the other hand seems more face/tempo and the 5/2 claw seems really good for that, Warlock needs both consistency and all the demon's and the claw, and Shaman... maybe they could do highlander with just the freeze, double invoke, and shield of galakrond? Shaman really doesn't need help invoking galakrond.
---
there was that tavern brawl where cards cost health during the Kolbolds and Catacombs or Witchwood era. Because of all the armor gain, draw, and burst damage Druids had from cards like Ultimate Infestation, they could win t1 if they could manage to beat the turn timer
---
‚ÄúOther countries doing awful things doesn't preclude the US from doing awful things as well‚Äù

NOPE.

You‚Äôre not just going to skip passed the 2nd holocaust asshole- answer my question first THEN defend yourself.
---
Is that the actual code?
---
Assuming this is paid content like the last solo mode, I really wonder if they were surprised how many people didn‚Äôt buy it so they are dangling new cards to sell future solo content.
---
Anyone remembers when the piti timer reset bug was? It was after GvG and Grand tournament, but was there any more sets that I should buy max 10 packs after the wild backs with gold go live.
---
Yeah, probably. I‚Äôm on mobile
---
As soon as I see the "create deck" button I immediately leave lol.
---
Well, Azshara's story isn't over yet. Her raid finished on a cliffhanger. I'm sure with time we will get all of them. :)

So far my experience is that Rafaam is absurd.  It's too early to say for sure, of course, but he feels like a better Yog.  1 gold for a minion.  He's good early game just because he lets you get more minions cheaply, and late game he's often getting good stuff.
---
He's also probably the hero with the most high-skill counterplay in the game, and admittedly was partly so good because no one was positioning against him.  People were using the old strategy of putting stuff like Lightfang, Brann, or Battlecries first to break divine shield, which meant I was getting those for free.
---
But even besides that, he was doing gross things early game.  I got triple boom bot and Herald of N'Zoth early from stealing some of them since people usually put those first, for example.
---
Maybe I just got lucky, maybe it's too early to say, and he'll definitely be weaker when people learn to put something crappy first against him, but forcing people to reposition is still strong and free units is crazy.  At worst his ability acts like Gallywix, at best it acts like a half-price Yog that gives higher-quality units.
---
thx
---
What does the yellow mana mean?
---
&gt;The battlecry shuffle build is good with the majority of the heroes, not just daryl.
---
Yeah. And now instead of having to spend gold rolling for and buying new battle cries, you can double dip when doing battlecry shuffling . +2/+2 is the sort of bonus that battlecry shuffling players are willing to rng roll and then pay a net 2 gold for. You're getting it for 1 gold.
---
I guess it's good for collection building, but I feel as if most people wouldn't ever use their new copies of Trade Prince Gallywix, [[One-eyed Cheat]], and [[Wee Spellstopper]]. Seems very impractical.

It is power creep. Dire mole is not the appropriate comparison. It's Enchanted Raven, which has the same stats but is class specific. Class specific cards are supposed to be strictly better than their neutral counterparts, or what's the point? Examples would be [[Hired Gun]] and [[Fierce Monkey]] being strictly better than neutral [[Ironfur Grizzly]]. Or [[Northshire Cleric]] being strictly better than Dire Mole. Granted this doesn't have the beast synergy of raven, so you could argue raven IS strictly better if you care about beast synergy, but it's same stats without a synergy that was of little use to druid.
---
We are? I thought that only applied to expansions after that was implemented, Knights of the Frozen Throne in this case onward. That was my understanding unless they're changing it for GvG to Un'Goro.
---
Well, considering that it was 4 games in a row, it looks more like a twist
---
She seems more like a much better Finley.  Which doesn't necessarily make her broken since Finley's bad.

4/2/5 | Adjacent minions can't be targeted by spells or Hero Powers.  
---
Heeeey. Is there a fix in the works for the glitch that crashes iOS players when they try to buy the solo adventures?
---
prismatic lens strat, which was a bit strange since most minions were above 4 mana    It wasn't that consistent but when it was, it was siiiick
---
He is not wrong, but neither are you. But they did have pressure to powercreep and make new sets better and better before standard was created, otherwise the meta wouldnt change enough and keep things fresh. It is still a thing they have to balance on, but with a lot more leeway.
---
That would be funny
---
How did they fix it?
---
I'm not worry about secret mage, they have been fairly easy to be beat
---
It‚Äôs Rank 1 Legend, the most coveted rank in Hearthstone, solely achievable by playing either Yeti Priest or Hero Power swap Shaman!
---
Then what?
---
Clearly don't have the budget to do quick fixes
---
&gt; It is power creep. Dire mole is not the appropriate comparison. It's Enchanted Raven, which has the same stats but is class specific.
---
Enchanted Raven is also a Beast.
---
Also, no idea why Dire Mole is less appropriate than Enchanted Raven. Like you just said, Enchanted Raven is a class card.
---
I'm not having this conversation *yet again,* honestly. I've made my point clear enough in other comments. What you said is nothing new, and I've already addressed it elsewhere.
---
It's not powercreep.
---
HAAAALA LU YA!
---
There is no way to convert BG Rating into Ranked Rating.
---
It's like asking: What is the equivalent to running 5-minute mile, but for rock climbing?
---
true,but who knows when that will be.
---
With next expac being shadowlands i think hots having crosver azshara stuff with HS is more likly then WoW. (azshara vs blackbeard or just azshara vs neptulon summer event)
---
ok thank you
---
should atleast be 1mana 0/3 or 1/2. if not fully unerfed.
---
that would be nerf,and not making sure card wont ever be used again
---
Arch-Villain Rafaam
---
I‚Äôll Take That!
---
Costs 1. Next combat, add a plain copy of the first minion you kill to your hand. (Note: this is an unbuffed, non-golden copy.)  
---
  
---
That sound insane. A free playable minion every turn, good from early game to late game.
---
Exacltly. I've already seen [[Embalming Ritual]] used in that deck to get a little extra value out of an infiltrator, but most decks don't run it because it's admittedly one of the weaker cards in that deck. But this card is much better.
---
*Gets nerfed*
---
Should this undo the nerf to [[Reckless Experimenter]] then?
---
Rafaam is absoultely nuts.
---
So, between putting all the new info together and originally looking to see if Blizzard China had anything to put out on it, they have now published a blog stating its a thing over there.
---
Arcane Orbs and Runestones are very likely China-only to get around loot box stuff. It is possible it could be used elsewhere, but not right yet.
---
Golden Glinda gives a system error, Sound the Bells! was disenchantable for me no problem.
---
I think they'll address it soon enough, the disenchant window is fairly large. Would be nice to have the dust before the expansion, tho.
---
&gt;In the future, we are considering an MMR normalization pass. What this means is that we would bring in everyone‚Äôs MMR closer to the 4,000 range.
---
What is the normal MMR now?
---
Don't say its name out loud, or you will beckon its return.
---
All 3 are stupid powerful and easy top 4's. I thought we were moving away from godmode hero powers like old Millificent and Mukla?
---
YESSS PLEASE. YES YES. YESSSSS.
---
cem#2252 EU 80gold quest trade
---
yes wtf why did they do that
---
≈¥umpy#1448
---
NA You first i guess
---
So a since "playing 3 games in any mode" is 60g quest, I suppose we can reasonably infer a 3:1 Orbs to Gold ratio. So the real question for me and (I expect) for all the F2P people out there: if you use orbs to buy packs, are those packs going to cost 300 orbs? More? Less? Truly I guess the question is: is this ONLY slapping a new veneer onto the existing economy (I doubt it), or is it going to be making the game cheaper/more expensive to play?
---
My guess based on what info you've got here: they'll keep the Gold/Orbs economy the same (amount rewarded for quests, etc./costs of packs, etc.), and offer better exchange rates for the Runestones in expectation that people will spend more money on the currencies you can't actually acquire in-game. So right now it's what $50 for 40 packs - maybe it will only cost the equivalent of $45 in Runestones for those same packs. When faced with what amounts to lower prices vs exact same grind rate, people might just spend a little money they might not have otherwise.
---
But as you said this is all conjecture so will be watching this to see how it shakes out once they officially announce.
---
Vanish, Swamp King Dred, Ice Block, Defile, Rat Trap, Mass Dispel are examples of cards that have been used for that. There are many others too.
---
I would also agree with this
---
Because getting pyramad, putricide, wogtaggle, ragnaros basically means you lose to the people who got better heroes unless you high roll the shit out of the early game
---
Edit: maybe not rag, but the take damage to get a coin chick
---
Lol at people actually taking this seriously.
---
Man they're really pulling out all the stops to convince people who left because of the Hong Kong thing to come back
---
There is absolutely nothing inherently imbalanced about a non-Echo 3 cost deathrattle costing 0 instead of 1. The issue was exclusively with Sn1p.
---
Literally the only thing that would be changed by reverting her nerf is that the first Sn1p would be 0 and the rest 1.
---
Congrats, this is the most shittiest post of the day
---
You lose the most interesting week tho.
---
All that for a drop of blood..
---
At least Sn1p‚Äôs reign of terror is over now. Congrats wild players!
---
C'thun does not come in the pack itself, it's like the messages that display for ranked rewards, season freebies. It is not the guaranteed legendary.
---
I think you mean PatchWerk instead of patchwork.  Patchwork is Blizzard's approach to fixing bugs.
---
Good change.
---
It‚Äôs really impressive how frequently Battlegrounds are getting updates and balance changes. 
---
Keeps the mode fresh. Wish it were the same for standard.
---
Ahahaha! You just have to click on Lunara and then click on another hero.
---
I think you only play against others in the same situation when this happens, the mobile updates take longer to get pushed out
---
Most Corrupt the Waters Shamans swapped out Vulpera Scoundrel for Evolve during this event.  Give that card a try.  Also, get rid of Witchwood Piper, you don't need her anymore.  Finally, fill the remainder of your deck with copies of any non-legendary minion you only have one of and you're all set.
---
Yep
---
I wouldnt say this is a bug. The decoy says it 'summons' the minions from your hand, so it makes sense that it works with Khagdar.
---
I would assume so, considering you could do that for the original adventures, right?
---
Yeah most likely 2 of those will die, possibly only one will die but it‚Äôs rare. The chances of all 3 making it too adulthood are pretty close to 0%.
---
Pretty much ruins the experience for the percentage of the player base that has spent the greatest amount of time playing, literally watching people get -16 for second, and experiencing a few games where I got -117 for 5th strongly disincentivizes people from playing.
---
Every expansion brings a big shake to meta thanks to 135 cards and new keywords, mechanics etc. No need to worry about that imo but if you power creep cards this much i worry the game will be broken again like death knights and Genn, Baku times.
---
Man, try playing some MTG Arena or Artifact and then come back, Blizzard is frigging generous
---
Poor Rogue conceded instantly after that
---
It depends when you opened them. If you havent opened any packs since the glitch, you should be okay to get the legendary.
---
I hesitate to say its guaranteed, because people's memories are fickle. You might have opened packs since then and already gotten your legendary.
---
But if you are **absolutely** certain you havent opened packs since the glitch, then yes, you are guaranteed to get a legendary within 10 packs.
---
Oh, give it a chance, it's a good way to get a respite from the always somehow poisoned meta, and it's a good sign that you came out 1st on you 2nd game
---
Then you pick someone who isnt rat king, curator, brann, or yogg.
---
This tells a bigger story to me. They want wild cards more readily accessible and with the recent wild cards coming back to standard this could be much more interesting.
---
They might rotate old sets into standard in som form or fassion very excited
---
Equip supercollider. Opponent does not have weapon removal but positions their minions carefully to play around it. Use this to kill the little minion in the middle so you can slam the taunt into the big minion it's protecting. Enjoy lulz. 
---
The most useful cases I can imagine for this are actually in complementing supercollider rather than replacing it. I haven't been seeing much SC lately but it may come back in this expansion given the big, expensive minions I expect to see in many builds.
---
They can get [pretty low](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dz1erq/lowest_battlegrounds_mmr_seems_to_stop_at_this/).
---
Damn still no khadgar
---
Thanks for the info. I just opened 2 old gods packs before the set rotated and I don't remember how exactly got C'thun
---
Bartendotron is a mech   
---
Patchwerk is a bunch of organic matter stitched together and given life  
---
Yogg is a god  
---
Pyramad is some kind of elemental 
---
The curator is a mech
---
Gendering them would be pretty dumb.
---
I don‚Äôt even have an update showing up yet
---
He didnt do it once in a single video in pre-beta multiple weeks ago and that proves your point? Bahahahabaa.
---
Sorry bud. But you're not important enough to have your own personal secretary. The proof is public domain and literally twitchable. You can go back to lalaland where internet strangers will bow down to your almightiness to travel the ends of the world to prove their point. I on the other hand have cited my evidence and have no further obligation in this argument. But feel free to try again.
---
Are you seriously comparing my statement about how it'd be mildly exciting if they changed things up with one of their sales to the log-in reward of one random expansion when they give a log-in reward with every single expansion? Do you not understand how those are different things? 
---
I wasn't saying that it'd be this momentous occasion because we got a card. I'm saying it would make this sale different than the other sales and therefore it would stand out in our memory as something special they did to celebrate an iconic character being added. The free weapon was just another log-in reward.
---
Thanks for clarifying, Chris! 
---
This update was amazing btw
---
And N'zoth, those were overshaowed by evolves, but Nzoth could've been quite the issue.
---
Great change !
---
MMR shouldnt be about grinding. Now it's more about winrate, or more precisely average finish.
---
Okay, I just hope that it works like this, would be unfair otherwise.
---
I just updated and deleted the decks anyway (PC)
---
How does one do the curator man
---
I only have my 2 GvG legendaries from ages ago, so pretty sure that I didn't reach the limit again. Is it even worth it though? I already have malganis, and I think that's the only one seeing play
---
Could also be a simple measure to sell more stuff, really.
---
Back in the days we had an Expansion - Adventure - Expansion cycle, and the idea was that the Adventures are cheaper, allowing people to save up gold for Expansions.
---
Then it was just Expansion - Expansion - Expansion, so things got a bit more expensive.
---
And now, welp. Now we will have Expansion + Adventure - Expansion + Adventure  -Expansion + Adventure. This is starting to get pricey.
---
What happens wuth millhouse and an echo spell now? Because it seems like echo hard-locks the cost on 1 but so does milhouse
---
You're misunderstanding. This is probably the situation they're picturing:
---
You know your opponent has two amalgams, both with Divine shield and Windfury.  If you think they're likely to use their hero power that turn, can you set it up so that the first thing they kill is *your* amalgam and force them to get a golden.
---
When you are buffing cards all the time and selling them back then no.
---
MonkaS
---
I wanna see more race-and-gender combos for the different classes that we haven't seen yet.
---
A male non-elf rogue, a female warrior hero, etc. Hamuul would be great to finally get a Tauren hero.
---
Toki is boss if you can survive long enough to hero power at tavern5. But you might as well be playing a hero with no power until then.
---
WaIt so will there be no more 4 mana cards?
---
Yep, so u/Dantehellebore beware, if you opened even a single pack of a certain set before that change, that would make you ineligible for the guaranteed Legendary in the first 10 packs.
---
But you didn't have an expansion releasing at the same time.
---
In every Blizzard game, there's some people who say "Blizzard would never do X because of (insert a fuck giant text here), only to Blizzard really do X later.
---
Classic WoW is the best example of this.
---
Remember to bully Rafaam by putting cutecat before alley cat.
---
A bad taste in the top players mouths perhaps but the majority of players either won't notice or see it as a means of an opportunity to catch up.  
---
Ideally the whole concept of the MMR system is flawed as it currently stands though the normalization they mentioned may certainly help.
---
I hope this isn't a circlejerk prank
---
But a little gate keeping butt hurt with earning heroic naxramas card back when it first came out.
---
Now it's less harder with the new packs.
---
Not if you are unable to play xd
---
I have like 80% winrate with OTK Murloc deck without anyfin. I just run taunts and card draw minions and even if I draw prismatic into prismatic I still have a decent chance of winning the game straight up. Only thing that fucks you is drawing old murk eye or rawing warleader without coin and you can potentially win those games as well. If you prismatic into a murloc u kinda screwed tho.
---
This makes things kinda interesting, because now they are actually functionally different as opposed to just using a keyword.
---
Do you think we'll see both versions in the future?
---
More like take my Runestones.
---
It's beta. They should just reset it.
---
Some people will be pressured to buy them before they're "gone for good", then if they want they can make a big deal about bringing them back later.
---
Still better for grabbing golden cards than straight up crafting them for old sets. That would be the only reason I did it
---
It's true
---
The team is working really hard and doing lots of stuff. 
---
We love Hearthstone and we love making people happy by making fun stuff for them to play.
---
We will make mistakes, and accidentally ship bugs and sometimes it will take us a while to get it right, but as all that happens we are trying to do it right and make it fun.
---
Hopefully our actions show how much we want to make Hearthstone great.
---
This change actually makes it easier for newer players to catch the top as the top players take a far larger dive for losing and less for winning (where they are facing players with larger MMR gaps).  
---
It is better than what we had before basically.  
---
I imagine as it's beta MMR doesn't mean anything now and too many people are putting arbitrary concepts against it.  The best period allows them to play around and see what happens all extremes of the MMR spectrum.  
---
No point resetting now when we are still in beta and you need the standings as they are to test and figure out what is going to be best in the long run outside of beta.
---
Oooh thx for answer
---
Don't lose. ;)

Awesome! Wait, what class? (nothunternothunternothunter)
---
And the adventure, that seems hype to me assuming the cards are usable everywhere
---
I didn't really see these combos too often, I think I only lost to the infinite snip-snap twice during the entire time people were complaining about it (and only once to something similar with Sound The Bells which was a bit of a fluke.) Heck, I think I had a lot of situations where the enemy Warlock could pull off the Snip-Snap thingie, but still couldn't win. I'm kinda sad this danger isn't lurking out there anymore...
---
...buuuut I also recognize that a lot of people were actively stressed out by this, so, happy day to you folks! Enjoy your new, safer world.
---
I got it the first time around and I say fuck anyone complaining about it. We had it for two years longer than everyone else, that‚Äôs our reward for getting it the first time around.

I don't know, unfortunately. I think the skin is cool but I've no intention to pay for it. Look around on the subreddit or the playhearthstone website, you'll probably come up with something.
---
I mean I agree with you that I like to play a variety of decks but I guess if the dude just REALLY likes Priest and is only going to play Priest anyway then it's cheaper to play that way
---
Appreciate the info.
---
I wouldn't say it's crazy as it is at best an extra +3/+3 per turn if you use all your coins just for buffs, and if you have an open slot. Come late game your coins might be better spent refilling looking for triples or upgrades unless you already have all your pieces.

5/4/4 Pirate | Battlecry: Steal your opponent's weapon.  
---
Yea, 3 full expansions and 3 required in between expansions.
---
Gotta pay every 8 weeks now... feels like a confirmation of the price of the game having more than doubled over the years.
---
You don't have to wait. They're all in the client. There's a check box in the crafting menu that says "Include uncraftable cards." You can read the flavor text of every card.
---
Or you can look in the official [card library](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/cards), but that doesn't have every card in the set yet.
---
I see you mixed up a lot of the other invoke descriptions as well. Don't mix up Galakrond's Battlecry (written on the card itself ) with Invoke/Galakrond's Hero Power (seperate effect).
---
&gt;**Priest -- Galakrond's Wit**. „ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇthe Priest version of Invoke "destroys 1 random enemy minion" and a fully buffed Galakrond will kill 4, which would be most if not all of the other player's board„ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇ
---
Priest Invoke - adds a random priest minion into your hand. "The destroy 1 random minion" effect is a specific card called Timerip that happens to have invoke as well.
---
&gt;Reminder that the Rogue version of Invoke draws a card &amp; reduces its cost to (0),
---
Rogue Invoke = Adds a random lackey to your hand, does not reduce to zero. 
---
&gt;The Shaman version of Invoke summons two 2/2s with Rush, which means with a fully upgraded Galakrond, they're *bloody 8/8s* with Rush.
---
Shaman Invoke = Summon 2/1 with Rush. The 2/2s upgrading to 8/8s are Galakronds Battlecry, not invoke.
---
Or Alleria. Lol.

Evasive is good. Elusive is for people who don't own a dictionary.
