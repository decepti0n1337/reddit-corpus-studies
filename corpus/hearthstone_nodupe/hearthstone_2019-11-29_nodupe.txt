Even on PC this happens when the queue fails. This happened to me 2 times and both times I had to end task for HS because it got stuck. But on mobile the offline thing happens every time I turn off my phone screen. I do it at work sometimes I need to turn off the screen for only a few seconds but the app decides to disconnect. Is there a workaround for turning off the screen?

Warrior will have a strong aggro deck, a strong midrange deck and a strong control deck, making the mulligan a nightmare
---
It would be a tier 2. Golden nets you a card one above your tier, or Max if you are at tier 6

Thanks! I did not know that.
---
On the topic of tier ups with daryll.
---

---
Tier ups cause the shop to offer an extra minion at tiers 2,4,6. This is important because it's easier to buy up the minions you don't want to get hats if the shop has less minions. This means the tech up to 3 is great because it is just as easy to do the dance as it is on 2. The tech up to 4 is good eventually, but worse than for other heroes because it means you can't just buy all the things you don't want to buff at the start of the turn.
---
Similarly the tier up to 5 is a bit better than you might normally expect, and the tier up to 6 is hot garbage.
---
Fuck me... Thanks for letting me know!
---
Yea I‚Äôm at 1300 ish right now, first time I‚Äôve aced up gold for a expansion so I‚Äôm very excited aswell
---
Well Kragg was originally suposed to get patches's effect so....
---
Well khadgar summons copies. If you play molten reflection on a minion with khadgar on board you get copy, not the base minion
---
The most I‚Äôve saved was back when witchwood came out and that was like 6k gold so I was pretty hyped; so you can imagine now with pre orders and 3k gold lmao! I hope you get good pulls man!
---
I did a mock up of the deck and I put in Chillmaw and Deathwing, I guess without having one dragon that can clear without needing a dragon in hand, you lose a lot of board clear potential.
---
Do you? Highlander has cards that enable highlander without having start of game effects. I think stuff like mud spark eel could easily incentivize going just even. Eternal has one card that restricts you to just even and it sees play despite there being no start of game effects
---
&gt;maybe the Doomsayer interaction would be an issue. 
---
If you think a 5 mana, 2 card board clear could possibly be an issue I don't know what game you're playing but it's not the same one I am.
---
Not really, since there‚Äôs a Galakrond card for each class. Would make sense for cards like Alex vs Dragonhoof being in separate EVIL and LOE class sets
---
If you can cast 6 spells in a turn, will it summon two elementals or is it just one elemental per turn?
---
It happened a few times yesterday too idk who‚Äôs doing it but let‚Äôs all be thankful for him or her
---
I think it's more because of the conjugated could've sounding exactly like "could of"
---
Nice flex bro. It‚Äôs a free to play game btw.
---
Zipperman!!!
---
If you're going to be this obtuse, there is no reason to continue.
---
Spirit lash and holy ripple, are board clears in the same way Arcane explosion and Fan of knives is. 
---
It has the ability to clear your opponents entire board.
---
Imagine burning your entire hand to summon 2 5/5s. Something Druid can do with 1 card.... oh and they get rush.
---
True, personally I would just enjoy a damn meta change, every game from rank 15 higher is always quest shaman, evolve or not. It just gets boring and frustrating
---
Interesting that Blizzard is so brave with the stats. Most r/customhearthstone renditions are so stat-inefficient  that it'd be the absolute worst card in an irrelevant matchup. This card I'll be super happy to put in any Reno deck.
---
Might sound silly, but shouldn't the card change the text then? I remember years ago they changed a card's text due to a Toast complain or something like that, right?
---
Well could of is the correct wrong way to write it. It's very common.
---
Should I take it? It‚Äôs chapter 2 with Elise.

---
Mistakes were made.
---
What connection is there between the two tribes that would suggest the deck would work?
---
I agree with you, but there are some great pay off cards and galakrond and invoke would need to be unplayable for all classes to have an even card pool, which is my main point.
---
Recent card reveal, new legendary weapon which draws a pirate from your deck when you attack

Silly goose. You wait until we open it in packs before asking for nerf to get 1600 dust, not before.

Edwin
---
Leeroy
---
Myra's Unstable Element
---
Zilliax
---
Rat Colony 1üíÄ
---
Creature - Rat
---
Rat Colony gets +1/+0 for each other Rat you control. A deck can have any number of cards named Rat Colony.
---
I like ‚Äúunannounced acquisition‚Äù
---
Saw some confusion about this so thought I‚Äôd drop in to clarify. 
---
In Battlegrounds, Ghastcoiler and Sneed‚Äôs Old Shredder can‚Äôt summon themselves and Primalfin Outlook can‚Äôt Discover itself. 
---
The random minion pools in Battlegrounds are smaller so these were modified a bit from how they work in other modes.
---
Wild Warrior will enjoy this card. Speaking for a friend.
---
Admittedly though, killing one Murloc is cool and all, but unless you get it down early game and stop the snowball, Hungry Crab isn‚Äôt gonna do much against a tribe that literally focuses on swarming the board
---
New Ysera cancels "no duplicates" effects and new deathwing kills Alexstrasza. Crowd Roaster is an oversight though.
---
Nozdormu and Sindragoza are A tier BECAUSE of their raw stats and initiative,  and same goes for Coldarra drake in B Tier. The very thing you think I need to value more. Most of the rest of the cards you mention are in C tier, decent value, decent stats, but not too strong. I felt D tier should be reserved for the truly useless cards, and F for the one that could potentially lose you games.
---
I was queued with a friend, his rating was ~600 lower than mine. Didnt think that would be a big enough gap. I took note before and it did not change from before the game.
---
Id say its considered underkill. Should be 5 murlocs with brann and megalo.
---
I just want to tell you as an outsider looking in you are wrong. 
---
A board clear is an action that targets an entire board and could potentially clear it. It is very simple and your argument is based on flawed logic. Just because a spell only damages the board by 1 it could be a board clear. Think of consecration or holy nova. They target all enemies or all minions. The point is **all**. That is what makes them a potential board clear. Fireball only hits a single target. Not a board clear.
---

Absolutely, it's high power level on curve and certainly worth 1 mana. The question is if it is worth a card.

The battlecry quest.

Definitely powerful but may be kind of awkward to play especially on curve. It may just be so good that playing it off curve is good enough tho.
---
You do not need to wait until turn 10 to play this minion. Just play it on 8 and enjoy seeing your aggro/midrange opponent have to deal with a 4/12 as they cannot go face without first dealing with the dragon and even if they do try to squeeze some damage to kill you next turn you just gained 1 or 2 6/6s to help clear the board.
---
You do not need to squeeze all the value you can from this minion against faster decks. The turn 10 play with the hero power is left for the control games.
---
Dragon, bro.
---
Guys, I'm starting to think this isn't Galakrond... I mean, based on the horn and mouth, it looks more like a storm drake in WoW. Also, I noticed that the leg behind its head is quite huge comparing to Galakrond's tiny front leg. I persume it's the drake's front leg.
---
Maybe that Chinese website has chosen the wrong card to represent.

My intial thought upon seeing this was:
---
"Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!" from gladiator :)
---
Well to be fair those poor shamans need something in their battlecry decks after evolve goes back to dark pit from whence is came.
---
I mean, depends.....
---
Sometimes Carrion Grub was run because it was so scary with a Houndmaster follow-up..
---
I think it will be run in Hunter once Master's Call, Zul'jin etc. rotates, as Hunters would lack most of their powerful midrange cards.(Master's Call, Zul'jin, Dire Frenzy, Scalehide, Springpaw, Shaw, Subject 9 for Secret decks, Rat Trap, and probs others I'm forgetting)
---
That being said, nowhere near as good as stuff like Animal Companion or other Hunter cards, but Midrange Hunters probably don't have enough good beasts or midrange cards in general for the expansion after DoD and might use something like this...
---
Arivederci
---
General rule of thumb: if the number starts with 1 it's NA, 2 for EU. Maybe 3 for asia, not sure about that.
---
I'll add you later, that's a promise. But I'm still a noob :(
---
Yeah but by turn 8 youre probably in reach when youre playing against an aggro deck, unless you're winning. In which case this is a slow win more card that you'd win without anyway. And in control match ups this thing is pretty bad because it'll just get removed. Pretty underwhelming card imo. But i guess its fine because warlock received some great tools this xpac, and you might play him anyway for the dragon tag.
---
It's pretty straight forward i guess... He's saying, if you do it 100 times, you have a 0.0000054344% chance do to it. Now, is that what he means? Probably not, but that's what he's saying.
---
Depends. It's not the buff but the card itself. And Handbuff is dominating in Wild right now, so it's not always terrible..
---
(By dominating, I mean Tier 1)
---
The deck uses Smuggler's run, Grimestreet Informant and Glowstone Technician....
---
That's the thing. I do. I actually have spent a lot on the game. I just don't like that I've never really been able to get friends into the game who were not already 'committed' due to the cost of entry for most players, be that in time or capital, before they can play competitive decks.
---
A lot of F2P players can play well with competitive decks and manage their resources accordingly. But that requires them by definition to be informed and to be good players in the first place. But for players just getting into card games in the first place, they don't have that.
---
Yeah you need to play the game more
---
This looks...pretty good as Kripp would say.
---
Look forward to creating a Warlock Dragon deck.
---
Ah, it's 8 o'clock and i am half dead, ooops i thought it was the shaman elemental thread... my bad xD
---
It could be a title, in which case it‚Äôd be unique
---
But if you literally tell anyone that boiling water is hot, they're going to tell you that they know. That's the point.  
---
Its something obvious. You comment doesn't necessarily disprove my point.
---
King Phaoris must be even more OP in Warlock too then right? Big turn 10 plays that just make stats are very hard to use.
---
I mean Nosferatu is a kind of generic name for a type of vampire.
---
You wouldn‚Äòt even have only 2 minions as every time your opponent deals damage to you you get a new 6/6.
---
Just play Board Clear Priest, I believe people were saying we‚Äôre up to two thirds of the deck by now.
---
Wait so nothing is everything? Or everything is nothing?
---
Are you in EU?
---
I‚Äôm in US
---
Aw that's too bad :( good luck with the search tho :)
---
OP inbox after this is worst than an ig model
---
With my Luck that will be that one time they all hit enemy face
---
That's cooler than it has any reason to be.
---
this doesn't take out any of the real murloc shaman threats like underbelly or warleader
---
Vivid Nightmare is better. It leaves you with a 6/2 and a 6/1 instead of just a 6/2.
---
Just in order to draw it early more often.  I rarely ever saw both played.
---
That's what the ads are for.
---
Instant win in arena

---
If this is sharked or Bran'ed, can he steal the same weapon twice or just fizzled the service attempt?
---
You think his claim that there aren't players in lower ranks who play a couple games a day is possible? That active players aren't bad enough to be at those ranks? He is not saying that there is an updraft, he is saying that there is an updraft big enough to cause that, in a 100ish games a month. I've stated multiple times that it's not an issue about the effects existing but about their supposed magnitude. They are obviously wrong.  
---
It's like you didn't even read the comment you just replied to. We don't need exact numbers. You again are twisting what I'm asking for. I never asked for exact figures. We don't need numbers from blizzard. How many times do I have to say stuff like that? They invented a requirement for those stuff that I did not present in order to avoid doing what they can. "Guesstimate" as they put it. They don't need figures for every exact factor. They made up a bullshit claim, I asked how they know it, they gave BS reasons. They should support it. If they can't they can't, but no, they won't admit that they didn't support it, they just wanna say BS like calling it a "mathematical phenomon" and saying the "argument is the evidence".   
---
They invented BS factors. Like MMR calculations, totally irrelevant bullshit. They weren't looking for true factors, just trying to find excuses. Some of the factors they did come up with later could contribute to an updraft, but so what, the issue isn't the existence of an updraft, but it's magnitude.
---
  
---
Guesstimates are better than what they provided. Why are the both of you insistent on exact numbers. Guesstimate. It's better than the nothing they provided to support the claim. What have they provided to support their postulated magnitude that is better than what it is possible to guesstimate without any data from blizzard or any like that? Answer that. You know it's nothing. Yet they continually avoided guesstimates by spouting BS and they continuously ignored stuff I wrote. They are continuously twisting what I am asking for in order to avoid anything concrete, and you fell for that and are continuing it. WE DON'T NEED EXACT FIGURES!

---
This is a lie. Bob almost NEVER has that something that I need
---
I think the devs might not want an eternal 5 mana boardclear for Warlock who already has lots of AoE, that being in standard for ever is likely not what blizzard wants forever as it would be an auto include in controlling warlocks. The whole point is Treachery has to cost way more than it should just because of that interaction which makes it kinda useless for other purposes.
---
Thank you, How can we play games together? I'm still a newbie. I have my mage at 17, Druid at 10, Warrior at 4, Priest at 3 and others 1/2.
---
RIP any hopes of a Jepeto-meta deck. Fucks Galakrond rogue quite a bit as well. By that logic, this is a very strong tech card.
---
Hey look, a unique / Reno killer.
---
and opponent's board must be empty
---
Imagine if he had Zapp and you got a load of Khadgars instead.
---
Banned from where? The game? No. Tournament? Could be.
---
I need someone to help with this 80g quest that‚Äôs been sitting here for 3 weeks. nihilist37#1387
---
For 3 Mana less than Pit Crocaliak with an easy trigger condition.
---
It's better being a deathrattle, because there are a Weasel Priest in wild and this one is better to ressurect and copy a bunch of times.
---
If you haven‚Äôt got zilliax, siamat and zephrys then craft those as they are neutral legendaries that go in a bunch of decks. We‚Äôre about to get a new expansion so I would hold off on crafting an entire deck for now.
---
Not for me. Instant effect against Mecha'thun is important, and Brann enables easy double battlecry.
---
Imagine not being an EVIL chad lel
---
 nice try
---
The trolling potential in Wild is going to be insane. Can't wait to fill my opponent's deck with thousand of albatrosses!
---
The more I think about it, the more it looks a well designed and balanced card. Good stats, which make likely that the deathrattle will trigger by next turn. It is good against "normal" decks since it gives to opponent two dead draws. And even against highlander decks, they won't be too sad about drawing one albatross, since that will trigger their reno condition. Will put two on my wild odd rogue and i'm pretty sure that most aggro and midrange decks will tinker with at least one.
---
Your next post: ‚Äùomg i predicted that water is wet and i was correct omg!!!!‚Äù

Are YOU the RNG God giving awards to everyone?
---
It's simple, first I play Alexstrasza...
---
It's why they're only situationally good cards, that require a deck designed around them to even kind of work. So yes.
---
Stop stealing Rogue's class identity.
---
Same target
---
However you wont be able to play this card twice in a turn so it gives your opponent some time to react. Overall I like the idea of the balancing behind it. The question is just if its Balanced well enough
---
I wanna Cumulo right in a Veranus
---
To be fair, inkmaster rarely saw play. You put her in reno mage, because you could, but if you couldn't afford her reno mage was fine without
---
More synergy for Chenvaala is good
---
Cheating out a flamestrike one turn earlier is huge (possibly two if with coin) against aggro. Even blizzard with a free 4/4 can probably win games. And against control you can use it to cheat out power of creation two turns earlier. 
---
Imo, this is way better than arcane tyrant as long as dragon mage is a thing.
---
Nah they kill it because they think it's responsible for their bad luck
---
I have golden Mayor Noggenfogger, nothing tops that sorry.
---
I like this a lot
---
That is not the point. Compare it to 10 mana value plays and you get the picture. 
---
The point is, not every card needs to "save you from dying". There are slower plays, value plays that are perfectly viable cards even though they don¬¥t "save you". 
---
Take your own advice and learn to read properly.
---
I'll definitely meme with it in a undatakah shudderwok deck.  Has the upsode over weasel that it won't eventually ruin your own draws as well.   Like you my mind immediately went to mechathun /highdraw deck disruption.  It will also be nice vs big preist, though they are exceedingly rare on ladder anymore (always hated them, but I do miss making them rez a bunch of garbage).
---
Another Dane card, this set is gonna have some silly shit happen unintentionally lol
---
Well yeah, thankfully not every card in hearthstone is so broken that it makes it to every deck in every situation, and you need to build a deck around some of them.
---
I like that this card is deathrattle, at least when you‚Äôre playing reno deck you can just run silence.
---
They should have made Alexstrasza available only to the heroes. Highlander Galakrond decks could potentially dominate the meta.
---
Undatakah shudderwok is gonna be fun lol.
---
Yes
---
Another Reno deck support!
---
Is this a Lighthouse reference?
---
Can you explain the "oger" part? Is it about the baseline for stats should be the same as Boulderfist Ogre?
---
You can use it to see results from things before the animation finishes playing out. For example you can see what your initial hand is before you see the cards to decide what to mulligan.
---
bruh
---
This is so weird. Who's doing this?
---
Too bad that I have never earned one.
---
Im sorry, but how are you supposed to get 13 mana?
---
Preferably a taunt or  board wipe. You still havent named an 8+ drop card that sees play that doesnt impact the board. If you dotn play hs your analysis of the game is worthless.
---
I had 3/5 mana left so I thought I should have gotten ooze.

Oh sht, this is a real card... I thought it was one of those Lolz custom cards...
---
I imagine both the eggs and the drakes cost 3, but we'll have to wait to find out, I suppose.

Next card revealed: biggus dickus, because they already commited to dick jokes

My money is on user/Whizbang\_HS

it seems to work, at least not in the first minute of this post :D

You are triple-chasing way too hard.

I will tell the MASTER.

Big Priest.
---
Yea you don't have to worry about filling your own deck with 1/1s
---
It was also an interesting episode of Black Mirror
---
I wonder if this could work as a finisher for Burn Shaman? Might try fitting at least 1 copy in. Turn 6 deal 5 is certainly slow though, so I doubt it.
---
You're trying too hard
---
&gt;yet no one ever complains about them
---
What?
---
Finally,  \[\[Hir'eek, the Bat\]\] will see play.
---
Are you saying that because you are hoping to get an award shower?

8/1/1 Beast | Battlecry: Fill your board with copies of this minion.  
---
We need someone to come up with a chart of all possible legendaries that are above 5 Mana and/or have more than 5/5 in stats.
---
Still just a 5 4/4
---
Also you can go for shuffle synergy since [[Waxadred]] also profits from it.
---
The points count down to 0 after you get them lol
---
Well, I guess this can get close enough to infinite value anyways without the cycling
---
Your efforts are appreciated.
---
:D
---
sadly this is probably the most accurate post in this whole thread.
---
Time to tip the scales!
---
Time to change fate!
---
Time to... Chrom. It‚Äôs Chrom time.
---
Minus the bonus stuff, but yeah.
---
But if you're Kripp and you want that outcome, it'll no longer happen, so you just hit this minion 3 times instead.
---
This is really good and I like it a lot, power back to overload shaman
---
The fact that it stays as a 5 mana 5/5 can make it above meme tier easily, you just need a marginal positive effect attacked to it and bam.
---
Getting a 5-mana legendary can be really good. It needs to hit something good fast though.

Yeah sure, who cares about Disguised Toast analysis, he doesn't play hearthstone just battlegrounds, after all, he doesn't play regular HS anymore
---
See the flaw there?
---
As I said, I don't play *anymore*, thank Arceus history has a tendency of repeating itself. My analysis is independent of me playing right now or not, as I have been playing for a long time to know a card like this can't go unnoticed and given the effect can be activated with something as little as using hero power, but the inspire like effect isn't some shitty +1/+1 but a 6/6 dragon, with a well stated dragon to go along.alao, when you say that impact the board, you mean battlecry/taunt right? Otherwise, what kind of impact? Your suggestion is a taunt or yet another board wipe, not like warlock already has like 20 board clears

Just play dragon queen alextrasa and get original one, problem solved
---
It seems like most cards revealed are either really conditional, or extremely greedy / ridiciolous value
---
meaning you'll get completely fucked by that one guy who just drew the nuts, or into a mirrormatch where people try to outvalue the other (the timmy in me is rusteling)
---
Of course it's probably going to be the "rise of aggro decks" where people try to rush down any deck trying to pull of something cool
---
This post has no awards so it isnt true.
---
It wasn't even a good Mage card, it's effect was mediocre and only good when paired with Kazakus' high level potions or flamestrike/blizzard. Every other spell one could cheat out was either inconsequential or actively bad ala Pyroblast.
---
great hearthstone post, very nice
---
You need this in your hand, you need a dragon in your hand, you need a big spell in your hand, and you need to have game conditions to actually want to use that big spell at the moment.
---
This is meta defining imo, denying 2 draws or 4 for 6 mana is insane
---
Im gonna get to attack with Nat Pagle!

Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air

It‚Äôs a Lewis Carrol reference.
---
‚ÄúBandersnatch‚Äù and ‚ÄúJabberwocky‚Äù both come from his poem.

Shudderwock is a clear reference to the Jabberwocky, this card is a reference to Bandersnatch.

You know that wiki pages are just written by randos on the internet right? That‚Äôs like lesson one of high school. 
---
[Here](https://www.hearthpwn.com/news/1132-designer-insights-ben-brode-on-basic-cards-power) is an interview from Ben Brode. If Ice Rager itself isn‚Äôt played and Magma Rager wasn‚Äôt either, it‚Äôs not power creep because neither card is actually used. If they print a straight better Kalycgos for 8 mana instead of 10 that is power creep. This has the dragon requirement so arguably that distinguished it from Inkmaster and it‚Äôs not straight up better even though this card does look broken to me.
---
You feel like dying when you're alone?
---
Shits op as fuck wtf
---
Correct abandoning those previous cards is power creep something creeping on yeti didn't make people abandon yeti it was all the other four drops before it

Yep! Every expac they have a final reveal stream where they show the remaining cards. Usually its mostly commons or rares, a few epics, and one or two legendaries they keep to themselves. Some cards dont get revealed, and will be in the final facebook dump once the reveal stream is over all cards will be able to be seen and sorted at [Descent of Dragons Offical Website](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/cards?set=descent-of-dragons)
---
He strikes when no one expects...
---
I would say that using three different looking artworks is not being lazy, just that there is a bit of a theme with shaman having a villain from a swamp getting things from a swamp.
---
It does have the advantage of being a decent neutral card so it‚Äôs easy tech for any deck
---
Seems a bit weak bro, prehaps instead if deal 30 damage... destroy the enemy hero and their card collection.
---
Zapp actually has a funny interaction with splitting image (I believe it's the correct interaction) where he attacks, then after he starts attacking his ability kicks in, but before his ability kicks in he is targeting the taunt and that's when splitting image kicks in
---
There are no statistics on hearthstone-decks.net and most decklists don't run her. I think it is kinda strange calling me out as a random guy on reddit but trusting the minority of Reno mage legend players playing her without statistical approval.

Not really. Nothing wrong with Hagatha getting the mucklings in on her evil.

Don't you get a supply of Reddit coins as standard if you subscribe to premium? After a while people probably have fairly significant stockpile.
---
It's a good card for plot twist warlock that will probably be good enough to make it in but I doubt it'll really improve the power level of the deck or make it truly viable at all.

It isn't rotating out because it already rotated out last time. It's from Kobolds &amp; Catacombs.

‚ÄúWow they‚Äôre introducing so many highlander cards that are never going to be good because of bomb warrior :(‚Äú
---

---
Bombs were basically limited to one deck. You could fit a 3 Mana 4/3 in almost any deck and it turns off Highlander by itself (at least for a while) where as with bombs you needed 2.
---
Homeboy can't decide if he's gay or straight and just settle on bi. Hilarious.

---
Their meant to be swamp things brought by Hagatha.
---
How is that lazy exactly?
---
That sounds... Not good
---
Nothing shown indicates laziness. They used a similar art style that they used with Shudderwock
---
Also, Jabberwock and Bandersmosh are clearly supposed to be related, given they‚Äôre both based on creatures from Lewis Carroll works (Jabberwocky from ‚ÄúJabberwocky‚Äù and Bandersnatch from ‚ÄúThrough the Looking Glass...‚Äù, so any visual similarity there is likely on purpose.
---
get it its funny because this set is strong haha
---
It‚Äôs a brand new copypasta. That‚Äôs the point of it, if you want to spread it.
---
What connects Shaman with Mega-Windfury?
---
10 chances to see an amalgam (or other high value minion) rather than 5 is good.
---
If there‚Äôs 10% chance to get one, and you opt to roll you have a roughly 75% chance to get one (50% of the time you get one in the first roll, 50% of the time you don‚Äôt get one but get one in the second). (Not strictly true, but close enough). 
---
If you don‚Äôt roll you have 50% chance.
---
Oh my god for a second there I forgot about that cancer...
---
Well good luck dealing with a 4/12 minion on turn 4-5 that also generates a 6/6 when u damage the hero
---
I was going to post this :(
---
as is everyone. Don't see how that makes a difference.
---
well you switched from "being" to "getting" so good job on the lack of redundancy.
---
mechanical crab rave: *exists*
---
i love reno decks, but this card is good in the deck for mirrors and against it. that being said i think it's fair (in the sense that it's good but doesn't completely shit on the deck): you can use your silence on it or just hope to draw the 1/1 in time
---
mean while Crowd roaster is 7/4 deal 7 and ranked lower
---
I can understand mbandersmosh and muckmorpher being conceptually similar, but Shudderwock is confusing
---
Anyone who doesn't know anything about LoTR: "WHY DON'T THEY JUST USE THE EAGLES AND FLY OVER?!?"

Praises and decries rng in the same post.
---
I made it to 6000 mmr and am pretty much done with the game mode unless a friend wants to play together. So sick of dumb fight rng, high rolling Rat Kings and a completely solved meta where rng is the primary decider of who wins or losses.
---
It could have been nerfed in other ways; the game needed a decent neutral taunt in the 5 mana range. It was specifically nerfed based on mana cost due it double casting with Valeera and 3 mana with Shadowstep.
---
You play a control deck or an aggro with 3-4 minions on board they all hit u deal 12-13 damage u survive with like 4hp and u have 22-28 damage on board in minions for your upcoming turn plus the life steal deal 4 damage spell x2. And if he choses not to attack u with his minions he can't still deal with a 4/12 and u can just clear his board next turn with the 5/5 deal 3 to all characters and summon yourself an extra 6/6 and by then he just loses.
---
This card has a great place and even if u play hard control u dont need to depend on the opponent hurting you u can hurt yourself.
---
My logic is that if the first roll was good then you only got to see 5 minions and if the first roll was bad, then it's irrelevant that you saw 10 minions because the first 5 were bad anyway.
---
The stats are relevant because those other minions were designed and balanced around whatever their original stats are (higher or lower), and this violates that balance, for either good or bad, so "most different" is a reasonable starting place for an inquiry on how large this card's effects might be (even though it doesn't take abilities into account).
---
It's a 1 mana spell that does 2 damage to a minion(will end up being 0 mana fairly often) It feeds Cyclone and the new mage legendary. I could totally see this making the cut without the dragon trigger.
---
You finally found a reason to eat paper in front of everyone?
---
That's what I'm talking about!! There's a high chance that, in case I have to, I'll eat yours if you let me and I don't find a better one!
---
Wow good joke
---
Legendaries arent unique items though. They simply are rarer. But people can craft them and open them at the exact same chance than someone that pays.
---
Paying just gives you more packs, therefore more tries to get a chance at them.
---
Solia was still bad when she was released, nobody is losing anything by this new card being released. The only concerns is that if they should buff cards instead of printing better cards with similar effects, or if this case of powercreep is good or bad for the long term health of the game.
---
I dont get mad because literally any card printed is more powerfull than my lorewalker cho and its forcing me to change cho in all my decks with newer cards... because cho was unplayable already. Solia barely saw play in early highlander mage decks before being cut out after optimicing. This is just another chance at that effect seeing play.
---
Also, you can still run both Solia and this new card in your highlander mage decks anyway, so its not like you lost your priviledge of buying packs with real money.

They should just add more. Why rotate 3 heroes??? If there was a selection of none I would totally understand rotation but 3? What were gonna have 3 new heroes for the next four years?

---
u/Seanpinyo last chance to get magni mate
---
Shitty standard decks in wild is going to be a bad time.
---
It's not power creep if the card that came first was underpowered and bad.. If the classic set originally only had a 1 mana 1/1 as its only 1 drop and they released a 1 mana 1/2 it not really power creep its releasing a card that is closer to what the base power should be. Same goes for this. Ink master is shit, making a better version of it is just bringing it more in line to what it should have been.
---
F
---
This is a huge loss for me. Ive been using him ever since he was released (packed him golden soon into the exp) and it saved me tons of dust. RIP
---
Gives shudderwock access to alot of "out-of-reach" battlecries from other classes. Unlike other random legendary generation, you can hold this until it has a good battlecry.
---
What do you mean?
---
&gt;decisive
---
Did you mean "divisive"?
---
Can't wait for Shudderwok to rotate.  Everything they give shaman feels nerfed a bit to keep the battlecries feom being abused.  Extra bonus, shudder is gonna get alot stronger in wild after it rotates.
---
I never saw anything about Amalgam going up a Tier, but the lead designer said they were going to make him a 2/2 at Tier 2 still
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be balanced if it was a dragon. Clearly an intentional design choice.
---
Well that‚Äôs a fluke then because he‚Äôs miles better than Putricide.  This game is still in beta and people are still figuring out how to play characters.  The divine shield guy was never played in its opening days and his win rate still probably isn‚Äôt great due to the slow starts, but he‚Äôs one of the best characters in this mode thanks to how good he gets in late rounds.

I used to play Spiteful Summoner Druid on my Asia account where I didn't have a whole lot of cards, so I didn't have Keleseth. I instead slotted Cho into the 2-drop slot, and it worked surprisingly well. The deck only runs two spells, 2xUltimate Infestation, so you'd pretty much only be getting spells and giving nothing back. And it had a decent amount of buffs as well, with Fungalmancers and Cobalt Scalebanes to let you trade away your Cho when you didn't want him any more.
---
My bet: This will be incredibly strong to the point of being almost broken
---
As a Paladin player, I‚Äôm kind of worried that Paladin‚Äôs support this expansion is looking too ‚Äúhonest‚Äù to keep up with those sorts of shenanigans.
---
Tempo storm? Are you joking?
---
So much value with millhouse.
---
Just say I hate trans people and move on.
---
This is a legendary that I will gladly pick up with Dragons Hort when I play Thief Rogue.
---
What if I told you that you can get 14/14 on the board a turn earlier? Because Onyxia is not particularly strong. Also consider Y‚Äôshaarj, which never saw play in any deck unless it could consistently put out way more stats than that, often with taunt, and even then it was only played because you could cheese it out at 4 or 6 mana.
---
because some hearthpwn mods have moved to outofcard
---
His username checks out.
---
They should move him to Classic then newbies can get a taste of how to play Hearthstone with some better cards.
---
No it can't. 3/s would be the chance to get one of 3 specific spells from one random roll. This is not even close to how discover works.  
---
The chance to randomly get pyroblast is 1/s, but in discover we get three options and you cannot get the same spell more than once so for each consecutive option s gets smaller by 1. So the chance of the first option being pyroblast is 1/s, chance of the second is 1/(s-1) and chance for the third is 1/(s-2). There are a few ways in which theses can be combined so it is much easier to just calculate the probability of NOT getting it and then take that away from 100%.
---
Yeah I know. That'll teach me.
---
Don't forget with Quest Shaman you can double up to 4 eggs, also means 7 mana put 5 minions on board which could help cheap out the Mogu Rush Guy
---
And Witchwood was basically just Odd-Paladin. Instant and permanent benefits without a big drawback have shown to be too strong. Also here's the thing, Undertaker didn't have a guaranteed start and broke apart if you killed the one card it was built around while Odd-Paladin would constantly apply pressure and quickly refill their boards consistently. Same reason Even-Rogue was so good, a really consistent and decent turn 1 every time and Handlock could just drop 8/8's on turn 3/4 followed up by a bunch of 4/9's and had also disruption tools against combo decks.
---
Tbh I'm starting to feel like people are just blinded by their hate boner for undertaker to understand that while broken it wasn't the worst thing to happen to hearthstone. Hell I'd argue that Tunnel Trogg was even worse
---
Big Spell mage looking kinda nice right about now.
---
While probably the correct decision, it's also asking ActiBlizz to do more work for less packs bought.
---
I know dude but thanks all the same.
---
I mean, I feel like there has to be some attempt to monetize that mode at some point. Especially if they are going to provide updates and new content.
---
No I'm not saying it the best site just in general sites like it that give tier lists
---
Active users have been on a decline. Revenues have been on a decline. Twitch viewership, decline. They call it out specifically in multiple quarterly earnings reports. They have made a lot of money out of hearthstone, no doubt, but they have not been able to grow revenues from it's peak days.
---
I agree with you, but if your opponent happens to have all the conditions met, it‚Äôs still going to feel awful when all of these new cards effects go off and your completely blown out of the water. 
---
Nothing you can really do to disrupt dragons in your opponents hand. So whether or not these conditions are met are out of your hands and have no counterplay. 
---
Just like the fact that data indicates that Evolve, Mogu and Desert Hare aren‚Äôt OP, because they aren‚Äôt consistently drawn by turn 4. But that‚Äôs no consolation to you when you‚Äôre against a shaman and they ARE drawn by turn 4.
---
She's probably expired. Hence the divorce
---
Black Mirror reference ftw
---
Wait, I thought that all EVIL classes would have one legendary besides Galakrond, but they already revealed this and the muckmorpher cousin with orange gems. Does this mean that Raffaam and crew get 3 leggos this set?
---
Lol tempo storm has been a joke for years. And not popular.
---
It's actually really cool
---
He can be used in Wild. Just sayin'
---
If we draw all our cards, then our deck would have no duplicates.
---
Genius.
---
Because no one understands the joke
---
I think nobody is missing that.
---
from your hero power  
---
Now what would be weird to see was using the mage hero power to kill the acolyte, just like how it can proc the elemental despite the hero power not killing it, it might as well work like that, since you drawed thanks to the hero power (?)   
---

1 mana 1/1 beast without text

Or chameleos

I've played too much against Whizbang decks, I've had enough, it's time for it to go. It's like fighting the elderly, if you win you beat an old guy, if you lose you got beat by an old guy.
---
People are busy fighting in battlegrounds. No one is trying new decks because both standard and wild metas are different flavored shitstorms. They also degraded arena to a joke recently by removing the pool system.
---
So far yea they are basically Discover Dragon + Class flavor keyword.
---
Pretty locked in for a Divine Shield Discover for Pally. Maybe healing
---
I tried it out in my taunt warrior. It was ... bad. The definition of a "win more" card.
---
Hearthstone to Battlegrounds.
---
P.S.: Yeah, funny and original.
---
I'm gonna make a wild undutaka shudderwock deck. It's not going to be good, but it will be worth it
---
So why are you allowed to identify as something you're not but someone else can't identify as an attack helicopter?
---
Who made you the identifying judge?
---
I'm sorry John
---
overall 6.5/10

Brann Bronzebeard - When I come, I cry twice.
---
just please Blizzard, don't make hunter great again
---
I am completely lost on what game this is.
---
Of all the potential turn 1 triples, that feels especially weak.
---
how can an opponent ignore it unless you are a turn from being dead. From the translation, face damage also makes 6/6s which can defend you immediately when it gets to your turn, and put out good counter pressure.
---
Has blizzard said anything in the past about never reprinting. If love to see this reprinted in the set. I know that in an online card game reprints can be frustrating in many ways. But perhaps they could do it in such a way that it wouldn't be.

I have played a lot of Evolve Shaman in the past and the only thing that made it broken was the Desert Hares.  If they nerf the main hare to call 1 Mana hares instead of 3 Mana hares everything should be balanced again.
---
Is there a reddit like place without the low quality, zero thought out meme posts? Not only is this unoriginal, it doesn't even make sense. These cards are so different in purpose.
---
Trrrrrrremble bef-hore meh
---
hah wow im so glad i stopped playing years ago.
---
I'm pretty sure the spell is question is Arcane Blast
---
Due to the widely incompatible nature of some of the brawls; as well as over the top combos that reward the deck building excessively, this would create both massively unfun game swings and a constant flux in the meta. Although the last point seems nice, such a rate of flux is very expensive and will choke many players out of the highest ranks. A fun idea that should remain just that.
---
As an aside, any play animation for the inkeeper should simply be the crafting animation; whilst full heartedly screaming ‚Äú[inkeeper shock noise], LEGENDARY‚Äù (or GOLDEN LEGENDARY if the inkeeper is as such).

&gt;  For an additional 800 dust (2400) a pretty decent budget deck can be built.
---
"a"
---
Meaning one.
---
Feels like we never got a real Uldum meta but just an event meta instead. A real shame for what I think is a good set that didn't get a fair time to shine before the next expansion.

I quit hearthstone 2 sets ago because of stuff like this. The entire set reveal has looked terrible and unfun. Free value just gets thrown into every card now and everything is overstatted. I understand it's hard to keep a game feeling fresh without power creep but this is just unfun disgusting and unrewarding gameplay for me. Wow I played 3 of my 4 cards in hand and now I still have 6 cards in my hand. You can't play aggro anymore, combo gets nerfed, control doesn't realistically exist because mid-range gets so much value anyways it's hard to stabilize. So the game is just a bunch of slightly more or less aggressive mid-range decks flinging value engines at each other until one player can't match it so they get drowned in the opponents card advantage. Sorry rant over. I'm just so upset how downhill this game has gone for me.
---
Gonna enjoy skipping this one, tbh.
