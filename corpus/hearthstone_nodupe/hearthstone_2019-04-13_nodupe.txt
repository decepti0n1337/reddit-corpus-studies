Why doesn't he get buffs off murloc related cards?
---
---
---
I'd like that but it is so much more expensive.
---
Then why is [[Dr. Boom, Mad Genius]] a battlecry for almost the exact same thing, but without the 'Summon and Elemental' part?
---
Spi-der Tank, Spi-der Tank ...
---
Right, that's exactly my point. Everything about the card refers to the mech itself except the voice lines. This is an oversight in my mind opinion. I don't think it makes the card bad nor am I confused about why this is a mech. This just stands out to me as a misstep of polish.
---
This just happened to me a couple hours ago

---
So, what the cards have in common is that you only start with two copies in your deck and your win condition is find ways  to shuffle and play more, trying to overwhelm your opponent with big bodies.
---
One of the builds was consistently top tier to the point they had to create a neutral card in order to shut down the main power of the archetype. Meanwhile the other just barely saw niche play and was considered too slow to actually see any serious competitive play.
---
And funny to think about it, Jades were actually the top tier deck. Turns out druid is the only class with ramp and being able to accelerate to later turns is pretty good especially when you want to powerdraw via Auctioneer and cheap spells like [[Innvervate]]. Once you got to the cap of ten mana, you were in a winning position solely by playing Fandral and two or three Jade Idols. Due to the Fandral effect, every Jade Idol creates a Jade on the board and adds three extra Jade Idols to put in your (ideally) empty deck. Pogos grow slightly faster but they are twice as expensive as Idols and they don't have an "I win" combo of filling both your board and Library at the same time. In fact, the most powerful combo you can do with Pogos is Tak (7) + Pogo Hopper (2) + Togwaggle's Scheme (1). That's ten mana solely to put a single Pogo in play while filling both your hand and library with extra Pogos. With the same mana, Druid could fill the board with Jades and every following turn play a larger and larger green men ad infinitum from the top of their deck. Also, the cap on stats is not a problem because having a 9/9 and 10/10 is good enough already. I don't think ever in competitive play Jades were any close to reach the 30/30 cap. 15/15 tops and that was probably overkill in an already winning position.
---
Except that's not really relevant. That's like saying an F-16 is actually a person in a jet. The mech cards you're are named after the mechs, not the pilots. Dr. Boom refers to the pilot, not the mech.

I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.
---
Why should the voice lines refer to the mech? That doesn't make sense. In Starcraft, your mech units have voice lines of the pilots. The voice line doesn't necessarily imply anything about what the card refers to.
---
I like grave horrors more
---
I like playing aggro and mid range because I personally don't like being against the same people for half an hour and maybe win.
---
Which would be..  the pilot.
---
I know this a just a meme but, like many people have already pointed out, Dr. Boom has never been a mech in any of his incarnations. He is very clearly a goblin.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The real question is why does the Jaraxxus &amp; Sacrificial Pact interaction even exist? It defies all logic, and is just well... random. Like it was an inside joke of the devs. No other demon related card can interact with Jaraxxus. You can't target Demonfuse or Light's Champion on him, Malganis gives him no buff and the game clearly does not count him as minion either, since no other minion related effect works on him.
---
You know the moment they fix that, people will start crying about Blizzard nerfing Basic cards again, which I find somewhat amusing.
---
Main priest lol
---
ok add me I'm snowball#11381
---
Like others said boom isn't a mech, but it would be cool if EMP kicked you back to base warrior
---
I'm a little of a 'creep' like you also, I mainly play Rogue, there was a time when I DE all of Druid cards just so I have enough dust for a Rogue deck, I feel you at that part.
---
But, you should really keep the classic and the Legendary of recent expansions, to avoid re-opening them again, it will cost you more the way you instant dusted them. And should only DE them if you are really really reaaallyy in need of dust tho.
---
Good luck!

I guy made a post a while back saying he completed the collection ftp having played since launch so it‚Äôs not entirely impossible to need more deck slots and be ftp.
---
I don't play Starcraft but that seems like a false equivalence to me. Why should the way another game does stuff have baring on this?
---
Regardless if someone played this card and didn't realize this was a mech due to the fact that it doesn't have robot noises then I'd say that's a failure in the design. For example a newer player in Arena failing to EMP Operative this because the were convinced it is not a mech due to how it vocalizes. Not an overly likely situation but if this happens even once then it's a result of the design not doing its absolute best to communicate this.
---
‚ÄúSolid 3 drops‚Äù

---
And yet it is tagged as a Mech! Curious.
---
\[\[Dark Cultist\]\] - hope I did this right.
---
The card is Piloted Shredder, not Piloted Shredder pilot. As we all know, the Shredder can only be piloted by 2 drops, but it's unclear what 2 drop exactly is piloting the mech (it could even be another mech).

I stick to one or two classes till I get them golden. I think it is easier now since arena wins also count towards golden class.

Same on my 11 inch iPad Pro. What a bummer.

Yeah Shredder may have been too strong for the time it was legal but it's a hugely successful design. Very flavorful.

That's really weird. I thought at least the interaction would be consistent.

It's important. Team 5 needs to get on this right away.

I did a double take because I literally just got done playing a game where that happened. I was using Witches Cauldron to farm a bunch of spells and kept turning his Malygoses into frogs. He had been BMing the whole game, but when that happened he shut up and I felt his soul die a little bit.
---
Just a few notes,:
---
8-5 vs Warrior
---
5-1 vs Warlock
---
1-3 vs Shaman
---
4-5 vs Rogue (didn't think it was that good, thought it was much worse honestly)
---
2-4 vs Priest
---
3-0 vs Paladin (but I don't think I faced the new Mech Paladin, so don't use that as a disclaimer)
---
0-2 vs Mage
---
5-2 vs Hunter
---
0-3 vs Druid
---
I started running Lazul's Scheme in the deck to troll Heal Druids so I could steal their Lucentbark, but I haven't faced a Heal Druid since I added it.  The original card was Forbidden Words, but it did save me in a game vs a warrior where he definitely had lethal ( Turn 21 here [https://hsreplay.net/replay/Fb6bkJCZcxNAXLeNRudVVJ](https://hsreplay.net/replay/Fb6bkJCZcxNAXLeNRudVVJ) ).
---
Also Harrison is almost exclusively used for Spectral Cutlass when I face Rogue.  Subbing in Jones is probably when I got my 4 wins vs Rogue since I was sure I never win vs that class.  As for Rank, I'm currently Rank 4 and 2 stars, although I got to Rank 5 before the expansion came out so I'm not saying this deck is good enough to climb with.

That would also be insane in the current meta, assuming you didn't have to blow additional cards to let it attack.

Its almost like simultaneously removing aggro tools and printing aggro hate every single expansion means greedy control decks run around everywhere.
---
Renoving face hunter was a mistake. Renoving mana wyrm was a mistake.

Token Druid is the best deck at the moment. Of your 10 losses, which classes and deck types are they?
---
It's Blizzard way of subtlety telling you that you need to buy Wild packs ..

Just submit a support ticket ..

Pretty sure the mask is modeled after Dr. Doom.
---
Purposely extending the game would be risky, or you risk losing it all. Similarly, your opponent would just concede if he see you dragging the game too long, since he gain nothing from sticking around
---
Blizzard wants the "Echo" tag for Witchwood ONLY!!
---
There is absolutely no replacement. All control decks would use Elysiana for fatigue matchups. If you don't have her, just concede whenever you play another control deck.
---
I‚Äôm referring to the combo of Innervate with Chillwind Yeti, so yeah that‚Äôs an invested card. I

It gets the extra three lifesteal because the second build a beast he added had life steal. Originally lifedrinker does not have lifesteal.
---
Milled?
---
I thought this thread would be about something else;
---
Inconsistencies with rare-ish interactions don't bother me half as much as the fact that sometimes you take 20 damage from 4 bombs in the top half of your deck, and sometimes you win the game with 8 bombs in the bottom half.
---
Makes it not only SUPER random, the game is decided by pure chance... But it also makes it super polarizing... Like most warrior decks these past few years really. 
---
Back then it was odd warrior that had 80-20 against some decks, and 10-90 vs combo... 
---
Now it's bomb warrior, where bombs aren't doing much vs aggro, but annihilate control (other than warrior because it armors up for 50 during the game). Can't wait for the first VS report, but I expect warrior will be just as polarizing as it always was. Which means that not only you lose/win games based on where the bombs are in your deck, you also lose/win games simply on the queue, facing an extremely polarizing deck.
---
Looks like you summoned a demonic BBQ
---
I don't really feel too defensive. I shared an opinion and explained my feelings and then someone came up in a very upset tone and told me that my taste in design is objectively wrong so I'm just explaining my stance more. Is that what defensiveness is to you?
---
*Yep*.
---
I've opened like 15 Rise of Shadows packs and pulled about 10 of these.
---
The name is great!
---
To be honest I crafted a ton of really weird stuff like portal keeper and the elephants that go with em. As well as Rafaam. I lose probably 75 percent of the time but I love the shuffle mechanic that it brings. All this is to say just play what you like to play right now. If you get burnt out go to arena or solo or tavern brawls, or take a break from HS. It's just a game have fun!

I honestly don't think this is nearly as big an issue that I have with Warrior right now as bombs killing you by RNG while you have 10+ cards in the deck so it's hard to say if I'd really resent this after that was dealt with or not.

Does the new Dr.Boom card do the same thing? I feel like I‚Äôve heard him say different voice lines, could be crazy though.
---
Give control shaman a try, it's insanely fun

Congratulations!!! :D
---
OK, but if you offer a draw to your friend it's like you never queued into your friend. I feel like that's fine. The problem with wintrading is when people let their friends *beat* them and then play for real against everyone else.

Spaghetti code in action. And pls tell me if I'm wrong but I think the Shield Block draw animation is running slower.

---
You can't really consider this the same thing tho, because 1 is neutral and 1 is warlock.
---
This would just be an auto include in every deck because every warrior plays Dr. Boom
---
You get them at the end of each run, I would contact support if you didnt receive anything
---
Yeah, Bomb Warrior isn't the best, just a little annoying to fight. Normal Control Warrior feels fine for the most part.
---
Frost lich Jaina‚Äôs lifesteal is an aura effect not a battlecry, (unlike boom) so when u replace jaina with rag, you lose the aura.
---
There's like 10 viable decks right now. Sure they will skin down to 5 6.
---
Especially since you can't attack with a weapon that has no attack value ;p
---
Technically after using EMP Operative Dr. Boom would have to become a 7 life hero because you destroy the vehicle he is in. 
---
‚ÄúMech‚Äù always has been a wrong-ish tribal tag because Mechs are piloted whereas robots are walking / driving on their own.
---
So for those who say that Dr. Boom is not a mech - yes, but he‚Äôa riding one. Piloted Shredder counts as well, you can destroy the Shredder after all, but not the pilot.
---
What? Rafaam is actually a great card I have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Wait at least 2 weeks for meta to settle. If you still want control shaman by then, I say go for hagatha.
---
 Do you see three voidwalkers yes you do ok thanks for playing
---
You joke but yesterday I crafted a Zoo deck and for the first time EVER I spent 400 dust on a Dire Mole.
---
Why is Crystallizer an Epic in the first place?

2/1/1 Beast | Battlecry: Add a Lackey to your hand.

Just made it, thanks. Looks pretty fun to use, honestly. Especially for being a Hunter.

It is definitely the strongest hero card from all those 3. I am not even mad with rush / 1/1s / 1 aoe / 3 dmg.. but that 7 armor thing.. that's is just frustrating. Mainly if he armors up 3 times in 5 turns..

NICE

This isn't ad hominem since there's nothing to argue. You're just upset over pepe being used, even though it has 0 political context here.

drawed it last card
---
how bad i can have rng
---
No? That Goblin was in play for a long time before the bug, you even played it before your opponents Rafaam (And Clockwork Goblin is a battlecry). The turn before the bug you played Dynomatic and Elek, neither of which shuffle bombs.

I think it can save progress or an access token or something when you start from scratch and don't create an account right away. I don't remember for sure that it does this on iOS, but every time I install it in an Android emulator it'll ask if it should check the cloud for stored progress.
---
It also depends on the hero. Priest Andwyn and Warrior Dr Boom‚Äôs ‚Äúwell played‚Äù sound genuine but Mage Jaina‚Äôs and Rougue Maiev‚Äôs sound condescending as fuck
---
Yeah slamming as many cheap cards onto the board as you can and going full face is much more fun
---
Unfortunately it doesn't work that way now. I've seen a clip recently where 3 choices from Tracking were bombs and the guy took a bomb for self lethal.

I'll take this 10/10 times as opposed to aggro cancer

I have turned off the iCloud Drive and logged in and no difference. No idea what it does lol

Absolutely no reason, but Team 5 probably saw it enables a lot of different decks (Heal Druid, Heal Paladin, Warrior) and decided no free stuff. Worst part is some genuinely memey cards (Burglebot and Pilfered Power) get the Epic treatment without any crazy or new mechanic just to dilute the pool.

Wtd did even happened, he Just died from fatigue
---
Being 2 mana is what makes it playable. You don't use Khadgar for his body (if it's not your kink), but for his effect. Cheaper == better for such effects.
---
Same. Like, the card is clearly all about bombs, why would it give you armor?
---
thats all the warrior decks. bomb control, dragon bombs, bomb rush
---
Ty for the link
---
They "fixed" this interaction secretly
---
But they can't fix the armor visual bug, the servers down time and shudderwock-horror bug

I had four of these yesterday. I felt bad for a warlock when he already used 2x hell fire and 2x twisting and yet my board was full of these fuckers.
---
The other guys need the Archmage qualifier so you have some idea who they are. Khadgar is famous to the point that he's known simply by name rather than relying on title. &gt;.&gt;
---
I think he doesn‚Äôt have the monkey but he definitely has the staff on his arm
---
Still better than facing Warpath Warriors.
---
Certainly opens the possibility of having a higher stats Khadgar card, similar to [[Deathwing, Dragonlord]] and [[Deathwing]]
---
Especially since the next two expansions are going to be about the attack on dalaran story as well.
---
Ha. Jokes on them in 6 mos. when "Could Go For A Snack Crab, battlecry: destroy a 5 mana spell in your deck" is released
---
I think youre right that it would have been a bomb shuffle mechanic. I think "deal one damage to a random minion" would have been a equally fine and not too strong replacement.

---
What the actual fuck! Nice nerf to a completely fair mechanic and for what? A few jade cards that only exist in wild and occationally arena?
---
I'd like to start ranting profanities, that's how pissed off I am. Why? Because this will completely kill off my Cutlass Rogue, which I very much enjoyed playing even before RoS. The one card that carried the deck was Lotus Agents, thanks to their ability to add two charges to the weapon and managing the charges was perhaps the hardest and most interesting part of that deck. And I was really exited to get more support for it in the new expansion, that new pirate, although slow, made things a lot more fun and consistent. The Fence was a nice addition but even that card didn't make the deck strong enough to consistently beat fast aggro, just gave it a better shot.
---
Thanks a lot Blizzard, for gutting a nice low tier2-high tier 3 off-meta homebrew with this kind of bullshit, thanks a lot.
---
4 Mana 4/3 text: you are immune on your turn.

Try to save 2 [witch's brew], it saved me a lot. Even going fatique.

Ohhh I totally forgot about that card.

No you wrong. Irrelevant vs AI or Real player always will be 89 turns - 45(player 1) and 44(player 2)

THE MIGHTY MILLHOUSE MANASTORM
---
Ok, but hear me out: You dont draw bombs by this card anymore. Boom now its not a dead card in most decks. It was just a stupid idea to begin with. Why do 3-cost and 4-cost cards shuffle 5-cost spells into your deck.
---
It would be cool but dr. Boom is not a mech .
---
Not for me casting it on turn one üòÇ
---
Same here. Been climbing the ranks with Mech Paladin.
---
Most games vs Bomb Warrior are way too easy. This is the exact counter punch to it.
---
It's test video vs friend:
---
https://youtu.be/xj3vWnVxKuQ
---
Eg here was 69 turns for one player:
---
https://youtu.be/RFifYygbg7c
---
We all felt like that in the beginning.
---
I know the game can feel very frustrating in the beginning &amp; most of us also felt that some of the opponents were clearly more experienced, fact is that you can play against people who've been playing for years &amp; just dont rank up, or play against somebody who's rank got reset for the month but actually belongg in higher rank etc etc etc
---
Even so, I think a big part of your problem is due to experience &amp; deck. 
---
The best thing you can do is build a tried &amp; tested budget deck &amp; upgrade as you gain cards / dust. Here is a link to top 5 budget decks at the moment https://youtu.be/yqI30fiofk0 you can also visit Hsreplay.com &amp; browse their top rated budget decks - these decks come with player statistics &amp; win rates e.g. this deck is played by 4,000 players in ranks 8-25 &amp; has a win rate of 61%.
---
Trust me dude, everybody starts out rough, it feels like youre getting nowhere &amp; that enemies always have an upper hand....then you start gaining experience &amp; looking at decks &amp; all of a sudden you climb. You unfortunately have to be pro active in this game &amp; do research &amp; stuff, best place to start is watching 'beginner hearthstone guide' &amp; 'biggest mistake new hearthstone players make' youtube videos
---
Seriously it's all Token Druids now. What beats Druid?
---
I‚Äôm loving the deck right now. It got me from rank 9 to rank 5 in an evening. Just wish I could make it more consistent.
---
May I ask you for your version of Tesspionage? I think I am pretty close to a solid version. I am just missing the final edge.
---
they play it before turn 6.... they can play it turn 3
---
The 28/30 is for the deck to the left, not the one you have selected.
---
Sorry to be party popper but they are not
---
Well, this is actually a good thing if you think about it. You don't want Tess to summon a bunch of Lotus Agents or Jade Spirits. On the other hand, she won't summon Aya as well.
---
Overall, this change is a straight-up nerf to almost non-existing decks in Wild. I'm so upset about this. Come on, Blizz.
---
with DK heroes rotating out, they didn't want to add more, and have a period of time where there was gameplay where there wasn't heroes, besides hagatha and boom which are a bit more niche
---
Everything indicates that is male creature
---
Done with Notpenysboat
---
It should actually say 13 if we're being realistic

I crafted that deck yesterday, went from rank 5 to legend with it, I would say its worth it.

i dont feel like there is enought support for thekal and kangor  either more healing or cut them for better cards in the deck

Aggro pally and Druid are pretty strong as well.

This "natural order" works unless card text specifies otherwise which is the case for endless army

congrats! I've been struggling to complete druid for over a year now, it's the only class that I'm missing... the thing is whenever I play a golden hero I keep thinking " I could invest this time in golden druid". As a result of that, I skipped a majority of cool decks during the last X expansions because I only played the missing classes. did you experience the same? how did you overcome it?

That hapenned to me too ...

You misunderstood. The bug was like this: You play Togwaggle, take opponent's deck, see which cards remaining in the **new** deck. You basically see your opponent's cards. They fixed this one after a while. 
---
Shudderwock casting Elysiana is the same problem.
---
Don't forget Zul'Jin.
---
It looks like he's grabbed the Staff of Origination, the power artifact from the original LoE adventure, and turned it into a glove.
---
3 legendaries in 50 packs is what you should expect tbh
---
What if you have 7 of them?
---
No it did happen, i was there
---
Khadgar was cursed from Medivh to look way older than he is. He is in his mid 30 I think.
---
I wasn‚Äôt being serious. I‚Äôve been playing token Druid since I packed cenarius years ago, and this is probably one of the strongest versions I‚Äôve seen.
---
By that logic priest always had the opportunity with ancient watcher and silence

I use it in my Shudderwock Mill deck to avoid fatigue. It‚Äôs dope to get ten new cards just before double coldlights go off.

Pedro el mono

Went 12-1 in the Tavern with the second Rogue deck. Mirror matches could be tough but overall it is a very strong deck indeed.
---
Rogue always emerges as a top class after a rotation, because of crazy tempo cards like Backstab and Prep.
---
Does tess no longer plays them? I would guess no but not getting that second Aya really sucks
---
Just make it like the start of a dungeon run UI: Click one of the 9 class portraits, then click of the 9 decks for that class.  Super simple.
---
If they don't hit removal before any of the value murlocs it can be a challenge and most the removal in warrior this go around comes online kinda late, giving time for the murloc shaman to take over the game. 
---
I mean 3 damage to all minions is a turn 5 play, with coin, the earliest they get in the deck and competes with the closest thing to a full board clear warrior has in standard atm. 
---
Hyper aggro strats have been the bane of control decks without cheap aoe removal and/or significant life gain as long as time.
---
I like your reasoning
---
Looks nice, only problem I have is the dust count üòÖ is there any way I can sacrifice one or two (L) cards &amp; what do you think can replace them
---
Etheral Peddler no longer discounts Lotus Agents and Tessa Waifu no longer summons them. They were actually great for Wild Tessa decks as they counted as 'another class'.
---
try khadgar mage with drakes giants and book of spectres, its amazing
---
And also use balefale banker if you want even more value with archivist
---
I just personally tested it and no, she no longer replays them.
---
No Death Knights in general makes the game so much more interesting imo. My only concerns are Boom and Hagatha, though. As the overall power level went down, they already feel way more frustrating to play against than before.
---
Just remember, ITS NOT ECHO. I will say it again, IT IS DEFINITELY NOT ECHO
---
Blizzard has decided they want to use rush, discover, and lifesteal more so they have made them evergreen. Each expansion has its own keyword that gives it its flavor. The woods ste haunted and the spirits echo things it hears and tells hagatha all the secrets. Why would echo move into new expansions outside if the ghosts and woods arent there. 
---
This argument is for 2 cards and 1 already rotated out into wild.
---
Where is that image from? I was using vicious syndicate for matchups before, but now its paywalled I think

I'm using Kreas list. It's on the competitive Hearthstone sub front page rn. It's called miracle though but it's not really a miracle list
---
The spreadsheet doesn't appear to be updating my collection (version 16.33)?  I have it set up to sync with my HSReplay account (I do have premium if that matters), and it's updated before just fine.  But anything I've done today isn't showing up.  For instance, I crafted a 2nd Astromancer but the sheet still says I only have 1 copy.  I also bought 10 Boomsday packs based on the sheets recommendation and opened a Stargazer Luna, but according to the sheet I don't have it and the pack recommendation values haven't changed.  My collection seems accurate on HSReplay's website.

If you could like quadruple the speed of the match I wouldn't care.
---
Are you young? Trust me, i think no one has forgotten this card so this post makes no sense

Takes a year to finish a match, that's why I don't run it.

I have much success with that one. Battling around rank 11-12.
---
If they were neutral "Druid, Rogue, Shaman" would not appear below Tri-Class cards when you unpack them, and they would not appear in your collection when searching class:rogue, class:druid and class:shaman.
---
Tri-Class cards also contribute to quest contribution in quests like "Play x druid/rogue/shaman cards" so we can say they are certainly not neutral, but multi-tag cards belonging to 3 classes at the same time

I know it's still a popular game, but do you have the figures for other expansions like Old Gods, Naxx, Un'Goro, etc?  Just curious what we should compare those numbers to.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Yikes.
---
How I understand the card's text is that a card in your hand just needs to have a class tag different than the rogue tag for it to activate. That's also how it used to work programming-wise. So the question is why they changed it to "a card w/o rogue class tag" without any notice/explanation/refunds.
---
So, no long? Gotta go on..
---
Lol what. The interactions are written in code so we are talking about programming. I won't answer further because I already made the explanation. Have a nice evening.

[This](https://i.imgur.com/dI30Imm.jpg) is what I‚Äôve been running. Archivist Elysiana isn‚Äôt really necessary unless you have a lot of bombs in your deck or you‚Äôre worried about a fatigue matchup. I just think it‚Äôs a fun card to have :)
---
If there was a deck without issues, it would be close to a 100% winrate. It's about how many issues does it have and if they outweight the advantages. Also, the viability of the deck isn't the only problem. There is a problem with how uninteractive/unfun to play against the deck is, while also being very popular.
---
Not sure if it was a good idea to comment here, because I don't really agree with OP that it has no weaknesses, but I also see the deck as problematic.
---
1001 is right out
---
Make a toggle in the settings menu then.  Call it "Expert Collection Manager" or some nonsense
---
I got disconnected about ten times in since the new expansion is released. It must be to heavy for the servers. There was a notification in Battle.net about this problem yesterday, but today I got disconnected once too. It seems the problem isn't fully solved at the moment.

The issue is he's a shit wizard.

I think RoS or Boomsday, as most popular decks have the most cards from those expansions
---
You can't call it strictly better. Better, yes. Strictly better, no. Don't misuse terminology.

I'm glad it is this way.  
---
But such a change indeed should be announced

Oh yeah, clear your bombs so you can die to fatigue instead, great counter.
---
HEHEHAHAHAHA! LET'S BLOW THIS PLACE *SKY HIGH*!
---
They release daily 10:00 PDT / 17:00 GMT
---
Yeah I get this too and by the time you figure it out, and try to reconnect, it's a loss.
---
One was designed as intended and then became a problem, one wasnt and was a bug/oversight.
---
Nice smartass behaviour you have, mr 900 IQ.
---
More power to ya man.  And that sounds like it might actually be fun to play against.  But the warrior match is such a minefield right now,I just cant risk it.
---
RoS will last the longest in standard so it's a good investment. Keep track of your pity timers of epics and legendaries to maximize the outcome of the packs
---
But when you go on hearthpwn and search for decks which contain a specific card, you will find Khadgar twice... Dunno why
---
Basically the standart auto murlocs deck provided by blizzard I just switched oracles and raiders for likkim and lightning bolts. Oracle is pretty good when you get on board but with rogue being so popular it's hard to get on board with weak one health minions so rather get some control/burst tools with likkim and lightning bolt. Raider is probably worst murloc to run in this deck. Tried hagatha but she feels super slow and unnecessary since if you draw her early she just sits in your hand useless while you could be developing your board and trying to outtempo your opponent.
---
If dr boom summoned one boom bot per bomb instead of 2 I think it would still see play.
---
In 1-2 weeks the meta will have settled and you'll know
---
Nice shitpost lol
---
the 5 5/6 from LoE that discounts them on battlecry i think? Also i dont recall the tri-class ones to work with cutlass and all pre-year of the dragon anyway. It was a bug for these few days imo. Kinda makes sense since they are in the neutral set
---
Exactly. If I say "Caesar" or "Napoleon" you don't need "General" before their names to know who I mean.
---
Yeah but there's so much Weapon removal running around, it almost isn't worth playing the deck right now, considering the Cutlass is pretty much your main card in the deck.
---
Yeah, I got your point, just curious about other matchups in the image and wasn't sure which way to read the table.
---
Basically yes
---
 A brief round of applause for that good ol‚Äô 40 turn limit üëè
---
It‚Äôs the aftermath. Their crummy minions just got turned into big demons and the minions don‚Äôt know what to think.
---
Then why not just fix it by using methods that only affect arena like reducing the frequency that Tri Class cards or Fence and Vendetta appear, shifting buckets, or banning Fence and Vendetta instead of changing an interaction that has functioned the same way for 2 years and allowed Burgle Rogue vs Rogue matchups to at least have some hope and added some level of consistency to burgle rogue?
---
2 mana Equality
---
The first half of yesterday the cards worked fine, yes. This change is about as old as the post I made is.
---
[He needs 4,986 arcane dust before this version of Khadgar will be available.](https://puu.sh/voobF/f10cebfa79.jpg)
---
From what i can tell from other posts, yes
---
No end of turn effect on the card. Just the "swap every turn" language.
---
Well based on experience, Doctor Morrigan is 100% guaranteed when used on an 8drop. While 50% of the time one of the minions you get will be a copy of your original target. Plus Baron Geddon will always arrive when you have low enough HP for him to give your opponent lethal.
---
They always worked with Cutlass, Tess, and Ethereal Peddler, I've been playing that deck for years
---
There are a few good cards, but it's mostly dust. You could still just buy it for the guaranteed legendaries/cardback, if you want.
---
Face me, you overgrown oaf!
---
Bomb weapon and the bomb 3/3 guy then as much removal as possible prob the 1/3 mech that gives 2 armor per damage and armor smith. War path and the 1 damage 1 mana damage all. The scheme and sheild block, i think you could boost about 50 armor pretty easy
---
Good for you man :)
---
I was just thinking,  why is the Doomguard so sad. Poor fella
---
Here to help.
---
Generally the ones with lifesteal related things and minion generators are the ones that were most toxic. Rexxar, jaina, guldan, boom...
---
I thought valeera, zuljin, thrall, were cool design and didn‚Äôt break the game. Hero cards aren‚Äôt the problem, it‚Äôs the type of hero card
---
I think that 2 legendaries from 9 packs is just a little above average, right?
---
My WoD lore is a bit rusty but wasn‚Äôt it just really powerful arcane magic?
---
Rafaam zoo is faster than summoneer mage.
---
I just want to remind you that historicaly murloc decks were were rocking 2-3 weeks after every rotation, than people realise Hungry Crab exists and murloc meta goes to hell.
---
I‚Äôve only drop a game or two with Murloc Shamen against the stupid bomb decks.
---
Wow! Thanks!
---
Almost 100 PogU
---
Probably when Anything Paladin rotated out of standard. At least I was sad then xD
---
Hagatha pumps out value but the randomness helps.  
---
Also, you have to play minions to get cards.
---
The real plays.
---
Heistbaron is really good
---
I dont get the caption
---
What does that supposed to mean?
---
not to cause trouble but Death Knight cards generated from The Lich King or Arfus used to be considered a separate class also. Has anyone checked to see if that has changed also?
---
Rogue can feel pretty bad to play into atm, vendetta and that damn rush 3/4 are insanely good. Plus, rng shit from random spells.
---
And why is that?
---
What did it do before?
---
but they're not from another class if you're one of the three classes
---
As an aggro player, this would be fucking shit for us too. I like healing while I smorc.
---
As an arena player I'm just glad it work this way now because Underbelly Fence was completely broken for the last few days, and I know every other player who take arena seriously think the same, a 3/4 rush on 2 was just icing on the cake with all the broken shit it currently has.
---
Was especially fun on 100+ pack opening day!!
---
Thanks i'll try it
---
Good one
---
B-but arcane shot!
---
You are STILL looking at this retrospectively, I remember when this card was announced, EVERYONE laughed at the massive cost and called it unplayable, it wasn't obvious that such a card would be used in aggressive decks at all as the only use people saw in it was evolve shaman.
---
yeah, the way to fix that is to make Underbelly Fence show up less or something, not nerf a bunch of other cards
---
A pretty good combo I think healing for 7 is pretty nice especially in rogue
---
Not infinite, but Control Warrior (without bombs) is really strong.
---
Bbbbbbbbrawl :D
---
I didn't realize it counted vs AI.
---
But its so nicely centered
---
I found shieldbearers to be too weak. The high mana cost is just too much

Thanks a lot. How do i play this deck ?

You have months to get it right, if you release it wrong that burden should not fall on the consumer.

She is great.  Do not dust.

She will probably never be the focus of any deck but she will be a value generator for numerous viable decks.

Great with dragons and mechs.  Great for Rogue with the shark spirit.

theres so much shuffling and battlecry recycling that the bombs will stay out of reach. Put in Zilliax and things get interesting.
---
It does to me.
---
4 Wrenchcalinur Bombs plus 2 Goblin Bombs is 6 bombs at 5 damage for 30 damage.
---
Dr Booms Scheme was NEVER about bombs
---
Actually the opponent brawled 3 times.. i copied all these dragons in my hand with dragon master voon, so i had 2 set of these dragons..
---
Cool find but 
---
- no paladin card
---
- one too many priest card
---
- one too many rogue card
---
- one too many warlock card
---
- one missing neutral
---
Your theory does not fit
---
What model are you using? I have a 7 and it runs perfectly. Actually runs like crap on my laptop, but perfect on my phone.
---
I don't care too much about dust, but at least it should be announced. What if someone thinks this still works and crafts cards? Not everyone reads reddit.
---
It shouldn‚Äôt work because it counts as a rogue card in addition to two other class cards making it a rogue card. Don‚Äôt complain about a bug fix. It‚Äôs not a nurf
---
Never doubt blizzard fans

Sorry rouge
---
I have no compassion for you right now. Your class is cheap as Ffffffff
---
He wasn‚Äôt always an Archmage...
---
That too, in Rogue vs Rogue this was one of the only minions you could summon back in a reliable way. Sure it still discovers possibilities of the other classes, but it's just a nerf.
---
That was wild!
---
So Lotus Agent is no longer a Tri-Class card. Does this mean he can no longer Discover himself? Or discover Aya, for that matter? Back in the Gadgetzan days I actually included that card in my deck because there was a very reasonable chance to get extra Aya. But I guess Aya is no longer considered Druid/Rogue/Shaman card, so it cannot be discovered via lotus agent. Or is she just considered a Rogue card? I wonder if there is an easy way to test wheter Jade cards are counted as being 'of the same class' or just being 'neutral class with deckbuilding restriction'

Right, but burgle cards don't interact with "non-rogue cards" or "cards not from your class", they simply interact with "cards from another class".

Oh really? I thought they changed it with the peddler text change, but if it were like this that must be an intended interaction since those cards were in standard for a year and its impossible for the devs not to notice it
---
n00b#1200 NA, trading 80g go first
---
I don‚Äôt see how any deck other than Aggro beats mech warrior consistently. 
---
Anything after turn 4 is basically 
---
Oh you have a good early game minion? Let me play a 5/5 with rush
---
Oh another one? Shield slam
---
Oh you have a board? Let me deal 1 damage to it three times. 
---
Oh you have another strong minion? Let
---
me use boom and shield slam for 7!
---
Oh you have a board again? How about 2nd brawl? Or better yet, I‚Äôll just play 3 mechs and kill them all because they have rush. 
---
Oh my hands empty now? Let me refill it with 3 mechs for one mana. 
---
Oh another big threat? Well now I‚Äôm on ten mana so I‚Äôll deal 10 damage to it.
---
Oh i haven‚Äôt used any of my minions to attack your face? Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôve placed 9 bombs in your deck. 
---
Oh you managed to outlast me and take me to fatigue? I‚Äôll put 10 more cards into my deck.
---
And during all this they are just armoring up and becoming harder to kill. I know there are decks that beat it, but the only ones I‚Äôve found that consistently beat it is aggro. I just played one as a tempo rogue (which everyone claims is a good matchup) I drew exactly the cards I needed but because I couldn‚Äôt kill him by turn 5 it was just game over. There‚Äôs just way too many high-value cards that deck has access too. The removal is extremely strong, and when you give every single minion they play rush you just cannot develop a board. Minion based decks that can‚Äôt kill it by turn 5 stand no chance. I know what everyone‚Äôs going to say, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a control deck, it‚Äôs meant to beat minion based decks‚Äù but the deck is oppressively good. Losing most games is one thing, but never standing a chance in them is a completely different. If both players curve out well, and one deck has an advantage over the other, I‚Äôm fine with losing; but the game should be close. Against mech warrior, if you both curve out well in a bad matchup, you lose 10/10 times. 
---
I think the problem is all rooted in dr boom. Not all classes have access to hero cards now, and in long matches, I think hero cards simply generate far too much value to be specific to certain classes. Compare jarraxus to any of the 3 other hero cards and the power level isn‚Äôt even close. This is because jaraxxus actually has a weakness which is the fact that he‚Äôs got a health cap. Majordomo executus was the same way in the sense that nobody ran it because of ragnaros‚Äô health cap. To me, the only way to have hero cards in some classes but not others while still maintaining balance is to introduce a health cap to all of them. 15 like jaraxxus. Make all of them have 5 armor too (including jaraxxus) and I really wouldn‚Äôt have an issue with the fact that over half the classes don‚Äôt have access to hero cards.
---
The spirit of burgle cards is you are generating them not putting them in your deck.   I agree the current wording sucks.  I also agree they should announce these changes but on a whole I understand why they did it.
---
Here is my current list, still fiddling with it to find a good balance of singlet target removal and sweepers.

Hi! thank you for these posts
---
Is maly druid worth it? i have almost all cards, and whats better maly druid o hunter?
---
They did say something: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/hearthstone/t/hotfix-patch-notes-april-10-2019/3045
---
Is there any way to beat token druid? I've tried multiple classes and at this point I'm just conceding every druid I come up against.
---
Ok. When you build a deck, you only can put in it your class cards. So, triclass cards should count as your class card, not shaman or druid cards, because you can put them in your deck. In the other hand, if you get them by burgle,  they should be shaman or druid cards and proc the effect (I would prefer in this case they were neutrals and could not be burgled). 
---
What I want to say, this is a bugfix because Im sure the devs printed all those cards thinking you have to burgle cards from the oponent and then play your cards with some additional effect.
---
A solution is to proc the effect with triclass cards if they are burgled, not if they are in your initial deck.
---

---
You madman! You've done it! I made an end-of turn priest deck and I was wondering if this would work. thank you.
---
If you shuffle it into your deck it didnt start in your deck
---
Actually had a game earlier today where i used my storm chasers to draw the bombs when i had healing available that would otherwise go to waste, ended up winning that game. Reduced the amount of bombs for Blastmaster Boom and the amount of burst I could suffer from if the bombs chain. Definitely interesting, and I will remember that Interaction
---
Kadgar nerfed ALREADY? Really?
---
Clearly it's a pre-arch Kad.
---
You'd have a heart attack looking at [[Tracking]]. The text on it has NOTHING to do with the actual mechanics behind the card. What the actual text would look like is:
---
"Remove the top 3 cards of your deck. Choose one to shuffle into your deck, then add it to your hand and remove it from the deck". Yes, you heard it right. The card you choose from Tracking will get shuffled twice via Augmented Elekk and it doesn't activate any "on-draw" triggers like Chromaggus, so the text I listed is what actually happens.
---
For the culture pls.
---
As thief rouge with Cutlass, I'd bomb warrior over, the 3 weapon removal control warrior
---
Why does every rogue archetype i love get nerfed :(
---
Yeah I remember it was for WWF, right? I bought him from an apple store iPad because I didn't have an iPad back then.
---
I dont really have a problem with the fact they changed it but with how they did it (silently) its obviously not a bug but a weird interuction since it could work either way based on wording (hence the argument), it was clearly a nerf in order to balance rogue in arena on the expense of wild players and that sucks

1/-/- | Look at the top 3 cards of your deck. Draw one and discard the others.  
---
I really wish I could find these bomb warriors that are supposedly all over the ladder. Haven't seen one in 2 days.
---
Infinite value and Hunter decks that could go full out aggro, and switch on a dime to full out control was absurd.
---
Mid range hunter is decent and cheap
---
I don't think it's very loreful that Gul'dan plays card games with Anduin
---
Or that Mecha Jaraxxus exists for that matter
---
And the fact Ooze is a good meta pick right now with two popular classes (Warrior and Rogue) both running weapons.
---
I started writing a response to this, but I came to my senses. I generally know better than to get into semantic debates like this, but I fell into old habits for some reason today. I'm going to go outside, get some sunshine on my face, and try to see the beauty in life. I regret being so negative with you and I earnestly hope you have a good day. Take care friend.
---
Ha! Nice to hear it works. So I guess the solution to this card during the bomb-heavy meta is to "play restoration shaman, not enhancement shaman". I thought I was grasping at straws, but nice to hear that there's something valid to it. :-)
---
Do you want to play standard or would you also be fine with playing wild? BTW it doesn‚Äôt matter if you don‚Äôt have good wild cards there are good budget decks that‚Äôll get you pretty far on the ladder.
---
Imo they fixed a bug, it makes sense
---
lol i was gonna make an edit saying i refuse to play hunter lol

i wanna play standard
---
I picked mr beast and then the retire button
---
Sorry for being negative too, have a good day too my friend
---
I'd believe it doesn't and OP is just showing this against the innkeeper because it's easier to set up.
---
What? Hearthstone? Yeah, it's pretty painful indeed but you can use your credit card to make it less so!
---
In that case I‚Äòd wait an other week if i was you because the meta still hasn‚Äôt settled yet. Also do you just wanna mess around and have fun or go to rank 5+.
---
It‚Äôs all about tempo waggle rouge
---
its not for wild, its cause of arena. and if it was for wild its a a really stupid  uneeded change
---
It's a suggestion, like I stated. No reason people can't be into more than one game. Never fucking said you're playing the wrong game. I'm on Hearthstone every day. Swear the internet is the worst.
---
Now that's a game
---
Yeah I can  totally see how turn 5 Jade Spirit into Togwaggle‚Äôs Scheme into drawing a schemed minion into turn 6 this could be *super* oppressive‚∏Æ
---
They should nerf the hero power if they need it at all ( they won't, but if they do in 2-3 months ).

---
You deserved it lol
---
I‚Äôm guessing that the base Drustvar Horror card does not natively have the Battlecry. It either is blank, or says something like ‚ÄúBattlecry: Cast [Shaman Spell 1] and [Shaman Spell 2].‚Äù Then SQH enchants the card by adding the Battlecry completely, or just filling in the spells. Because the spells are enchantments, and not native to the Horror, Shudderwock doesn‚Äôt replay them. This would be consistent with cards like N‚ÄôZoth or Da Undatakah not working with Deathrattles that are enchantments.
---
While it might seem intuitive that they would work like Zombeasts, Zombeasts are cards that are created whole-cloth from two others, while these seem to all be the same card with different effects added to them.
---
A thought just occurred to me. Does anyone know what happens if the Horror changes zones before being replayed? Copied in hand or deck? What if it dies and is resummoned? Does the Battlecry stick?
---
You didn‚Äôt hurt my feelings. You asked, I answered.
---
Tak.

Ooooh

Priest is so weird right now: I don't want to play against it, because some still run divine spirit inner fire in silence priest and somehow always seem to have it. I also don't want to play priest (though I opened madame lazul) because none of the decks are actually good enough.

Id argue that a generated tri-class could work but a deck-built one shouldnt, but thats too messy. 
---
  
---
Cards that create cards ‚Äúfrom another class‚Äù shouldnt give tri-class though. Thats the answer.

I am perfectly jealous. AND a golden common. Sick pack.
---
what about thief rogue
---
Yeah, that was pretty bad but it was only 10 cards or so being shared. Over half the deck (40 cards) were neutral with the remaining cards being neutral support (cards that were stronger with neutrals). So it was Neutral Blood being ridiculously strong, followed by Neutral Haven, then Rune after each one got nerfed. Then after that, Neutral Forest and Sword popped up until the devs had enough and nerfed the Keleseth like legendary which was especially notable since she was the flagship of the expansion.
---
Thx bro
---
It should be 7/7/7
---
Literally better than some constructed combos, at 3-2 too, dang.
---
How long can this go on

God. Cant you summarize your point of view in a couple of sentences, without all the useless filler stuff? Nobody wants to read 10 paragraphs on how devs are apparently fucking you and ruining your fun. 
---
The interaction had no place in this game. 3class card is a rogue card as well, not a card from another class. It just happened to get changed now because it finally lead to something being actually broken. And since noone cares about balacing wild unless its something as bonkers as the naga giant situation, nobody cared about the interaction before either.
---
Pretty sure they were thinking about arena with this change, even that mode is much more important than wild
---
Except the bomb part is the worst part of the deck. Blastmaster Boom is the only reason to play those bomb cards.
---
That's a really good point. So a "Restoration Shaman" could turn this into a sort of Minesweeper + Resource Gather card. Heck, I might wanna start doing this on purpose.
---
Are you on crack?
---
I blame the old gods and their plots.
---
What happened
---
So an espionage during rogue mirror that pulls aya or jade spirit trigger it?
---
SpareThyme#1755 NA 80g quest trade, I'll show then you go first

WC?

Yes, I think myras is really strong at the moment.
---
Thanks for this, fun to read! I've been playing Whizbang as well a bit, which is fun every new expansion for exactly two days, after that too many better versions of the recipes exist or you roll one of the crappy non-fun ones a bit too often and you question your time allocation decisions in life :)
---
This is at rank 5, it's fun for much longer in the lower ranks where I spent a lot of time previous expansion release.
---
When the only way to beat patron warrior was to get so much armor and pray they couldn't do the math before their turn ended.
---
Just kidding, they always had enough damage.
---
We don't talk anymore, like we used to.

Control Shaman and Khadgar Mage.

Swap him for vargoth.

he is insane
---
I personally find the regular bomb warrior to be much more enjoyable. The control deck might be slightly better in some matchups, but it's sooo boring. You end up doing the same thing every long matchup, making the same plays and hoping for RNG to favor you in the same way.

*Thanos liked this*
---
That was beautiful
---
Same happens if you burn 1 card (don't ask me how I know that, it was for sience).
---
Aggro decks are cancer, control decks are cancer, then whats legit for ya?
---
I am always the warrior in this scenario. Hahahaha
---
No, fuck them, talk how you want. Just remember your Humor Kata :)

Have a good day too!

 OtherJoe#1201 , looking for people to hammer out daily quest with.
---
Charge, so broken. Thanks Blizzard
---
?
---
 
---
 I mean maybe you can compare bombs to the old anyfin deck, but bomb warrior isn't combo at all. And I dont have (much of) a problem with the control warrior shell, but you can't really interact with bombs in your deck aside from that one new legendary.  I guess you could specifically not draw cards, but is that really an interaction?
---
I don't mind aggro decks, it's over fast. Nothing fun about a long grindy game that was decided at the queue.
---
Surprised to see her after they put her in the game as one of DK Uther's tokens.
---
Rogue has a lock on decks that are largely played simply to piss people off: Quest Rogue, Mill Rogue and the pre-nerf Kingsbane deck. None of these decks were ever especially dominant except in certain matchups, and I've even seen them described as 'griefer' decks on here.
---
a Shitwizard doesn't fall far from the shit tree Randy
---
You get a pity timer of 10 for the first legend of a given set. The normal pity timer is 40 packs, which means one average one legendary per 20 packs.
---
Im having trouble understanding your response. If you put aya into your deck did it work? Did getting aya and jade spirit from espionage or blink fox also work?
---
Added as a friend and GM confirmed.
---
Come watch my stream @ Shaaakr
---
I dust everything wild. No regrets.
---
Mist wraith but he is in rogue and the "echo" card in question is shaman
---
As a Priest main I honestly don't even mind at all, it was so broken.
---
Olny dust the shitty ones or the ones you don't like playing. I dusted my mage quest because I always hated that deck and my King Mosh because he was too slow for standard and imagine how shitty it will be in wild. But keep the guys you love. Whenever I get bored with standard I play a control warlock on wild or a Jade Idol miracle druid with Yogg to have fun with the game again. Don't do anything you will regret.
---
This tilted me just watching it
---
My mech hunter hasn‚Äôt lost to bomb warrior yet

Not a Standard valid deck anymore, but this

Hearthstone is far more pay for variety than pay to win.  If you're willing to dust bad cards you can make good decks.  Just don't dust good cards ever.

I see you‚Äôve never played against happy lock

the cutlass is bullshit tho
---
as a mech hunter i havent lost to bomb warrior yet
---
What's the tracker overlay you're using?
---
Mana Wyrm and Mana Addict want to know your location.
---
Wait....You mean we weren't supposed to play into Psychic Scream? No wonder I'm forever level 18
---
It depends on each of us, maybe some preffer to play just 2 games a day with a control deck, others 8 games with an aggro deck. I put myself in the first category and thats just a personal thing/opinon. If everyone played aggro decks to end games asap then...what would hs be?
---
Hehe..."Your opponent has left!"
---
Yeah. Both worked before. This makes it so that putting a tri-class card into your deck alone isn‚Äôt enough to trigger Fence. What Blizzard did was make it so that tri-class cards never count for mechanics that care about burgled cards, just because of this card in Arena.
---
Right, and another word for "Reconsidering the interaction" is a nerf.
---
People here need to either play casual, get to legend *once* for the cardback &amp; then just hover around ranks 20-10, or simply finally admit that maybe they just don‚Äôt like card games. 
---
Because *obviously* there will literally always be a distinctly frustrating or annoying aspect to any meta. Even just having to conform to the meta is in and of itself something that adds a sort of existential stress to the whole thing, and I suspect is what‚Äôs mostly responsible (in a subtle way) for the complaints people always have. You naturally want to use a wide variety of cards in a collectible card game and generally ‚Äúhave fun‚Äù in the process, but a competitive mindset will naturally lead you to only being able to use the best two or three decks.
---
Only 3 meta decks woot great expansion blizz
