Firebat was playing the deck and shitting on galakrond shaman constantly.
---
---
---
Friday most likely.
---
And how does that fare against galakrond shaman
---
Yeah, but it so easily dies to shadowword death that the oppressive number of priests are running, so it's literally unplayable.
---
this man is either a bad shaman player who cant get wins cos of no brain or to poor to play against meta decks(tbh me tho lol)
---
This is wrong. The nerf dust is still live. The announcement stated the nerf period ends on DEC 19th.
---
I feel like all tokens/spawned minions should just be 1 star for damage calcs. They should help in combat but not randomly murder your enemy.
---
You really like them long queue times, dont ya?
---
At least one beetle needs to have died for Undatakah to catch it.
---
I’m pretty sure it happens when I switch hero’s quickly if the one u switched from was golden, the one u switch to will be animated.
---
Not unless it did something broken... like summon more units *and* power up your other cards *and* charge up your 7 mana kamehameha.
---
That worked, I don't even have 2 Seal Fates, I have no idea how that happens.
---
Falstad?
---
Non mech decks ran it because it's a mech? 
---

---
Ok lmao
---
That worked, I don't even have 2 Seal Fates, I have no idea how that happened.
---
imagine being this delusional
---
Edwin went for Zapp and killed me the next turn pretty much
---
They're wrong, like you.
---
That’s the point. It reduces you to such low health that you kinda need something to help protect you.
---
I had a game where Dragonbreath actually did help out, opponent had frozen my board and went face, Wandering Monster summoned him and unfroze my board.
---
See? It is a good card. Just as long as you aren’t actually putting it in your deck.
---
Siamat is a legendary and it's effects are powerful to reflect that.
---
Gyrocopter might have been fine in a different game but this is Hearthstone. If you factor in everything, it is stupidly powerful for a common. Everything meaning: it's a mech so magnetize works on it, evolve mechanics, summoning / cheese mechanics, etc.
---
I play Galakrond, but only because I run a combo deck that requires Fate Weaver. And once in a while you get lucky and have a fully invoked Galakrond to clear the enemy board. 
---
It's sad that Galakrond, which is supposed to be the core card and theme of the deck, is only there because it's required to prime a different card.
---
also the jousting mechanic that was more relevant at the time evil heckler came out
---
Different people, different likings.
---
I dont find football fun at all, yet its a widely common liked sport. I dont say all football fans are inbred retards for liking seeing 20+ people running in shorts kicking a ball into some sticks, because I understand that they can like something different than me.
---
It doesnt matter what I will try to explain to you about what is fun about aggro, because its subjetive and if you dont find it fun, you simply dont find it fun.
---
Please behave appropiately with the other commenters, and stop with stuff like "aggro is cancer" and "fuking aggro players they are mentalli ill", because thats completely inappropiate and shows how little empathy you have for other human beings.

Pretty sure those arms are still bigger than the building I'm currently in, though...
---
Almost like what makes it worth 5 mana is all the effects and the body itself isnt worth 3 mana... congrats ypu proved my point for me.

---
As I said in another response, you can't just look at a card at face value. This is Hearthstone.
---
There are so many ways to cheat out higher cost minions or make them randomly appear on your board that certain cards become a problem.
---
It's just the sorting layer of the sprite object.
---
I really don’t want to see a world where they nerf shaman but not this effect that is very similar to mana cheating, if not the same. Not sure what else I would like to see changed because so much focus has been put onto Shaman and Faceless Corruptor.
---
new expansion is full of OP cards. almost everytime you feel like you lost because your opponent used some OP effect. i imagine it's a precise choice of developers. personally i think it's boring. draw right card and autowin
---
True, but playing for value is a lot of fun and value can matter for survival / winning.
---
I mean a 0layed a Eogue who used this to pull both Anubisath Enforcers so... yeah you right.
---
That is a hairy vambrace, not a hairy arm.
---
That being said i dont know shit about warecarft lore.... i assume hunter hero is wearing vambraces?
---
Please note I'm not OP of this comment thread. I just want to add to the conversation, especially to point out other weaknesses houseleft missed. Gotem correctly identifies some of Galaman Shamakrond's core weaknesses. There are others. The deck is sorely susceptible to board clears. Paladin is just the only deck currently playing board clears. In the first days of the expansion, I was doing quite well against shaman with Handlock because of the clears available to me.  As the meta has shifted and settled, that deck doesn't work well anymore, but I'm convinced control decks can handle shaman, even in its current state. 
---
I'll admit I'm actually playing the deck right now. I mean, it's a great deck and I have the cards. How could I not? For reference, I climbed to rank 5 with over 80% win rate. Held above 70% to Rank 4 and have been climbing and falling with WR currently at 65% (Rank 3). Somewhere around 100 games. I mention this to say I have some idea what I'm talking about. To head off a retort, I hit at least rank 5 each season and regularly climb to 5 with +70% win rate on decks from druid, hunter, paladin, shaman and even priest (I love rez priest, which can probably counter shaman as well. It has 6 board clears on top of 6 minion removal spells. I mean, come on) so my success is not attributable just to the deck. 
---
I had the sneaking suspicion that even the unchanged control warrior deck of the last expansions would fair well against this deck (4+ board clears). I actually faced one at Rank 5, god bless him. I ultimately won that match, but only because he didn't draw his clears. If I weren't climbing ladder, I would be experimenting with control deck counters to shaman. Highlander Big Spell Mage is already not bad. All the warriors are playing pirate, but control warrior can deal with shaman. I don't know if a viable deck exists, but warlock has the cards to counter it with a control style deck (3 large board clears, 4 small ones). Heck, my record against zoo lock is the same as my record against paladin (2-4). 
---
Shaman's entire game plan is battlecry and spell oriented. Why is no one teching in hecklebot or unseen saboteur? Hunter is the second highest played class with several T1/2 decks at lower ranks. Why are hunters not teching in wild bloodstinger?
---
All of this is to say that the meta isn't really settled, and most people complaining are likely playing aggro decks (extremely common immediately post-release) and other T1/T2 net decks that just can't answer this particular shaman deck. If you are at a rank floor, I encourage you to try something else. Oh, and once the nerfs hit, we are all going to wish we hadn't ignored deathrattle rogue. It is just as oppressive and will be everywhere in a week.
---
Ehh, living dragonbreath is kind of a nice card though.  It’s an elemental (pretty sure there was a point where elemental decks ran nightmare amalgam).  It makes all your minions immune to freeze, which...with invocation of frost run in 27% of standard decks right now that’s actually relevant.  Frost Nova, Ray of Frost and Blizzard are also in...basically every mage deck, with Frostbolt not far behind, and Blizzard and Frost Nova are often discover options off of Zephrys (who has a history of ignoring card text so...).
---
Playrates are low because everyone is trying galakrond and dragon decks right now, but it wouldn’t surprise me if living dragonbreath just turns out to be worth running in some zoo-ish or midrange-ish deck.
---
This way you can craft the shaman deck, and rank up for free and learn some if any weakness the deck has. Then get your disenchant full value after the nerfs. I doubt kronx is getting nerfed so your spending 1600 there, but hes auto include in every galakrond deck. Other cards you will most of your dust back, since I'm assuming the dragon pack will get nerfed and maybe even the rare card.
---
no cause non mech decks dint run it
---
That's really weird. Is anyone else having this problem?
---
It was pretty oppressive especially with Prep. The fact you can clear a board full a taunts and remove any enchantments they had is pretty nice for a tempo deck that likes going face.
---
Usually its caused by getting out of the game then going back in before it forces a reload, it can cause some desync from the server !nd do weird stuff like this, anyways you can tell its happening if there is two of the same card in your deck but its not "stacked"

---
i think -1/-1 is a better nerf than +1 mana
---
To be fair, wand only has a 20% pick rate so people might be picking it more if they've already drawn most of their low cost cards
---
It counters even decks in wild quite hard.  (Note that it doesn’t wear off at end of turn, they actually need to invest the 3 mana to get their hero power back).
---
Outside of wild, though, not a big deal.
---
Man I don't even own Shudder, just trying to make do
---
Power creep is inevitable. But since there are no physical aspects of this particular CCG then they could theoretically raise the power of all aspects of the game in order to keep it reasonable indefinitely. Buffs to emotes FTW!
---
Wild growth was a really good card that did see  play in every non aggro Druid deck. However the same has been true for cards in other classes. (and other Druid cards too) Backstab in rogue for instance has seen play in every rogue deck bar quest. Tracking, Bow and AC has seen play in most hunter decks. Etc. Cards that see play in most decks that are part of a class identity were fine as long as it's only 2/3 cards and that they're not fundamentally overpowered/problematic
---
And whilst the innervate nerf was justified I'm not sure the wild growth nerf was. It was powerful but never OP on its own. Druid became OP for 2 reasons. 
---
1) too many ramp effects made it too consistent and allowed nourish to also be draw instead of ramp a lot. 
---
2) the nerf of every aggro deck and card. Druid is supposed to be punished by aggro decks for ramping but since aggro sucked that didn't happen.
---
Or proof that your deck building skills suck? Believe me we all know shaman is a problem but You act like you have no other cards. I’m sure you have plenty of cards that would allow you to make other decks, since you have been playing for awhile and you bought $80 worth of cards. Shaman is getting nerfed soon anyway. Get your parties out of a wad and relax.
---
So glad I opened 3 Wizards and 3 Saboteurs 🙃
---
I miss tempo rogue and stuff, I love rogue and all but I've kind of disliked deathrattle rogue, as my favorite parts about rogue is going to big combos with things like cold blood, shadowstep,leeroy and Edwin.Deathrattle always seemed more of a cool priest thing, and I'd rather have rogue go back to that instead  of having this op deathrattle rogue, I'd rather have this.
---
yea, I played with anibusath today too, had 55% winrate overall and 3-1 vs hunters, out of 38 games. I found anibusath version too slow, hence the winrate. Other decks outtempo me. With welps you are faster, since welp is 6 mana and also good with ziliax
---
Wish I could get a deck even close to that good. I don't understand why they got rid of buckets
---
Nah, the old patron days was kinda like that
---
They clarified. That happened when I switched from lunara, you can see the leaf animation.
---
No, it actually doesn't. And there are no 30 packs unless you earn them. Or buy them, in which case there are as many packs as you want. And still, 40 dust is a lot to a new player.
---
New Alex is incredibly strong but very greedy, a lot of lists cut her because she's too slow against the current meta tempo.
---
Zephrys is basically the reason Highlander decks still exist, safest craft since Dr Boom probably.
---
Well, I didn’t know that was possible, so you basically just did
---
Just wait for patches tomorrow and stop crying
---
why do gamers talk like comic book villian.
---
You're right. It should be more from guarantueed legend in first 10 packs.
---
But it has a poor matchup vs Holywrath, so its okay.
---
Not really, i can do 29 dmg in the same turn
---
0 mana tigger + 2 mana banker + 5 mana holy wrath = 25 dmg
---
Zephyr gives 1 mana soulfire = 4 dmg
---
Can you stay with rogue at 30 health ? I doubt that.
---
right, so shaman having an absurd 66% winrate must mean that I suck at building decks. 
---
I don't care if shaman gets nerfed. that's not the point. I have no interest in continuing to support this game.
---
Performance for PC.
---
Lmao everyone already knows
---
Hit legend with a mix of handbuff and robosaur rattle rogue.  If you don't get the Necrium Apoth going by turn six, you almost always lose.  If you draw your death rattle minions before you get a chance to use Necrium Apoth, GG.  
---
When it works, it feels amazing and incredibly oppressive.   Although it still isn't half as bad as Shaman.
---
Okay
---
People still play bg?
---
But it costs 17000+ dust
---
And once they nerf that, they'll complain about Pirate Warrior, and when they nerf that, they'll complain about Face Hunter, and when they nerf that, expansion and rotation will be out and then people will complain about...you see where this is going.
---
Rogue has been climbing a good bit, hunter is almost near shaman, though the highest winrate us a cheap 1600 dust deck for complete smorc, probably great for lower ranks.I hope that it isnt just a one sided thinking process for only shaman, but maybe for other cards that are good like faceless, maybe apothecary etc.
---
Why do you think you have to get rid of your weapon for Mecha'thun to work?
---
Nope, mostly because I've been playing this broken deck myself rather than playing against it. And I'm yet to be in a game where I'd think to myself "if this guy runs silence, I'm dead". And even if you manage to silence the apothecaries, I can still anka+magic carpet, or necrium blade on curve. 
---
Plus, just think back to previous meta: no amount of silence and polymorphs would stop combo priests. 
---
Spellbreakers are as good of tech against rogue, as deathwing is to shaman galakrond. Sure, you'll remove the immediate problem (if you're lucky enough to draw it in time), but there plenty more where that came from.
---
Breaking metas and breaking ankles.
---
Some calls are right, some calls are wrong. Pros are pros because they tend to be on the mark more often than they're off it, and consistently so.
---
Both incorrect and irrelevant.

---
This is the best meme I've seen on this sub in a while, well done
---
Pure curvestone.  No thanks.
---
As a fellow priest main, I would suggest you try:
---
* Quest + Mass Resurrection (currently the best performing for me, routinely beats up Gala Shamans and Pirate Warriors unless there's an incredible luck imbalance. Grave Rune is a great new addition)
---
* Galakrond + Dragon Priest (was doing well with it last week, idk it might not keep up anymore but it is fun)
---
* Highlander Priest (takes me back to the Mean Streets days...)
---
I'm curious, how are you building your Galakrond deck? I think midrange is completely the wrong way to go; Priest right now is all about control. Galakrond himself gives you a Deadly Shot, +5 Armor, and infinite value (slowly). The hero power is too slow to matter in the early game, so tbh I wouldn't use low-impact gala invokers. Besides Time Rip, I probably wouldn't include any Invoke cards in the deck whatsoever. That gives you room for all of Priest's plethora of removal available, which will help you survive whatever they throw at you until you have breathing room to set up Galakrond or Dragonqueen etc. I think this is the most removal Priest has ever had available at one time.
---
It just isnt enough, look at other similar games. Blizzard is notorious for balancing their games incredibly slow.
---
What's right in your eyes, might be wrong in another's. I'm not calling you a SJW, I just think you have a misunderstanding of what something means to be subjective. I agree that it's wrong and awful to be racist, but that still falls under subjective truth. Everything falls under objective or subjective. The statement "the earth is flat" is objective. It's objectively wrong, but it's still objective. Black people are superior to white people is subjective and based on feelings. You can't really prove or disprove that, but you can make the moral argument that you shouldn't judge someone that way.
---
&gt;This logic alone makes me wonder how many cool/powerful decks out there just never get discovered.
---
I mean, how do you think the bandwagons get started if \*not\* by meticulous testing and innovation producing a strong deck?
---
I had a nutty paladin run with that one. One game i got a holy wrath into Shirvallah that were both created by it. I only needed 3 damage face with the Holy Wrath, but it was still fun to see the 25. In the other games it gave me some good class cards as well, but it really is an rng fiesta of a card
---
No
---
She has a pretty strong early game cuz she gets so many free stats early. Any hero that can make it easily into midgame is automatically pretty decent imo
---
I know it’s not impressive for some people but I’m proud of my accomplishment
---
I like how they are all at least interesting cards even though they are unpopular and low winrate
---
Can someone explain what's happening in the new meta ? I've been out of the loop since the last expac. 
---
Is the new shaman meta good/bad ? What is your opinion on this ?
---
Bouncing the undertakah gives another charge of the battlecry to the shudderwock stack. And then you play more Shudderwocks. Lots of them. Forever.
---
Anti-Quest tech is sooooooooooooo niche in concept, it would never see play outside of *very unbalanced formats.*
---
Ah I thought you were wondering why they aren’t showing anymore.  Unsure why they didn’t show in the first place.
---
So this isn't fluff but 90% of the posts on here are? You mods are killing it hah
---
I agree but I do think overall card quality is much better in shaman right now. The thing I most agree with you is the fact that everything has rush... Also since when was rush shaman class identity. And the fact that they get to control the board.
---
youre probably talking about lifecoach
---
sir calm down its just hearthstone you dont need to scream at someone because they play a deck you dont like
---
&gt;I have never seen Rafaam not finish at least top four 
---
You should just spec me
---
Fuck off with these posts. Jesus Christ. We get it. Blizzard is fixing it. A nerf will arrive literally this week. 
---
Also if you can’t get out of rank 25, it isn’t because Shaman is too strong.
---
They announced they’re nerfing Shaman so check back in probably a week
---
Yeah. A card that literally nobody plays is *really frightening*.
---
HOW ABOUT A NEW ARM?!
---
Mage has ZERO taunt minions...
---
Mage main btw
---
Blizzard saying that shaman weakness are card draw and card generation.
---
Corrupt the waters, Shudderwock and Galakrond: laughts in battlecries.... literally...
---

---
While we're at it, I feel like 12 is a bit too good for priest if they use Mind Control. How about making it a 7/7 instead?
---
That is what makes this meme so great
---
I got tired of the endless Galakrond Shamans in standard today and switched to my wild mill shaman, built around under taker, dancing swords and shudder. In my first game I was up against a questionable Galakrond Shaman running quest and jades. I destroyed him
---
I’m assuming that’s Whizbang? I’ve been thinking of making an alt account just so I can make a golden Whizbang. Seems enjoyable to just hover in the the 20-16 ranks fucking around with other Whizbang players. I wouldn’t want to do it all the time of course, but it would be a nice change of pace from time to time.
---
First off, your own experiences, and even those of krip would fall under anecdotal evidence, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence, which is way more unreliable than a site that literally just collects data, and presents it. hsreplay throws out games where there isn't enough cards shown to know what decks each player is playing.  The match up table shows the average win/lose between the average version of those deck architypes.  Yes a good pilot can beat a bad pilot in any match up, and none of the match ups are 100%, but when a single deck type is literally green across the board, that indicates the deck is pretty close to s tier.  It is a fun deck to play, and I'm sure there is more than just combo paladin that utterly destroys it, but it's still gross to play against, and they should have never been given a double invoker...  I'm pretty positive Blizzards stats are leading them to make the upcoming nerfs, not just a few people whining on Reddit.
---
**Anecdotal evidence**
---
Anecdotal evidence is evidence from anecdotes: evidence collected in a casual or informal manner and relying heavily or entirely on personal testimony. 
---
The term is sometimes used in a legal context to describe certain kinds of testimony which are uncorroborated by objective, independent evidence such as notarized documentation, photographs, audio-visual recordings, etc.
---
When used in advertising or promotion of a product, service, or idea, anecdotal reports are often called a testimonial, which are highly regulated or banned in some jurisdictions.
---
When compared to other types of evidence, anecdotal evidence is generally regarded as limited in value due to a number of potential weaknesses, but may be considered within the scope of scientific method as some anecdotal evidence can be both empirical and verifiable, e.g.

Trump was right when he said it should be 6 mana
---
I mean, did you consider multiple charge minions in the deck as well? Magic Carpet? There were a few pieces you had to put together before it was super playable. Warbringer has been in the Highlander Rogue decks since launch too.
---
flag nsfw please, valeera's legs almost gave me an erection
---
I hear you. Still gonna rope every shaman I see though.

Demolished also saw play

---
Too weak! Make it cost 1 mana.

Holy shit. Scaled nightmare is insane in this huh?

But that isn't a basic mechanic, in card games precise wording is everything, ramkahen roar could have been triggered just off of a Mad Summoner and another four cards.  That isn't stupidity, it's a technicality.  Hearthstone is like one of the few cardgames with such consistently inconsistent wording.
---
I'm not sure why people think shaman is that good. I don't think I've lost to shaman since the expansion dropped.
---
Just play tree druid, or tempo rogue, or zoo warlock.
---
My data is lacking on zoo warlock since I've only played it a few times, but I destroyed shaman the couple of times I played them.
---
But token tree druid absolutely destroys any shaman.
---
almost?
---
aggro warrior kinda mood
---
Do you know how good Dragonmaw Scorcher is? This is 2 mana less with a continuous effect and beast synergy. Board clears on a stick are some of the best cards in the game (see: Ravaging Ghoul, Twilight Flamecaller, Maelstrom Portal, Dread Infernal).  
---
It's normally not ideal on turn 3, but you still play it if it's the best tempo option. There's a fair chance it kills something on your opponent's side (example: If he coins a 3-4 against your 3-2). Like any board clear card, you play it when it's good. It's a decent 3 drop that's still really good later in the game. That's what separates the good 3 drops like Spider Tank from the great 3 drops like Stoneskin Basilisk. 
---
In an aggro deck, I'd rather have Dreadscale than Frizz, since cheaper aggressive cards do better than a 4 mana 5-4 and the AOE effect really helps for board control, which is super important for aggro. 4 mana 5-4s really aren't that great, and you can't really wait around for the discount value playing aggro.
---
Disappointed but not surprised.
---
Serpent egg?
---
I use oondasta in the  "duel paladin", a super funny deck! Btw don't craft golden if you're missing cards and dust...
---
Most broken right now, but not most broken ever. I believe that goes to undertaker hunter.
---
You will find a deck using oondasta for sure. Question is are You going to play a deck with oondasta/paly quest. If answer is NO then hf playing highlander with golden alexstrasza ;) I always dust golden cards in order to make more good decks for more classes.
---
I yearn for the expansion where priest isn't simply running the usual inner fire combo. 
---
Can't believe im saying that I miss DK Priest.
---
Yeah I’m really sick of it but my only other deck I have now is quest Druid lol without any of the new expansion cards. Sigh perhaps after the dust  refund I can craft another deck. Good luck in your climb.

First of all, thank you very much for the advice. However, I just tried this strategy with the standard build path and ended 7th as Wagtoggle. Maybe my luck was really good until mid game as I was in first for awhile and conveniently hit a triple when I was at 6 mana. However, once I hit tier 4 and got started to get rid of my lower tier minions, shit hit the fan. Faced somebody that had some pretty beefy murlocs with a 15/14 amalgam and the mech deathrattle and lost like 12 hp. I barely made it through the next few rounds and then I upgraded to tier 5 and bought a minion with 10 mana, but the next round I went up against someone with a crazy wrath weaver. At this point I was at about 15 or so health with a full board of tier 3/4 minions and void lord, although they were all under 10/10 due to the lack of time I had to buff them up. Next round I went up against a guy with two soul jugglers and a full demon board. It didn’t even matter that the demons were fairly low in health and attack, the soul jugglers just decimated me. All of my opponents that chunked my hp were still at tavern tier 3. All of the minions I bought I thought ultimately helped my board. Did I do something wrong, or did I just have bad luck? 
---
P.S. I’m not trying to be *that* guy, I’m just really curious what I did wrong.
---
Yeah, I opted for lackeys over Galakrond here for Draconic Lackeys and a better curve. Kibler also ended up dropping Galakrond from his list today with some success -

No, priest got plenty of adequate cards, the only shitty cards they got were envoy of lazul and chronobreaker. Priest’s problem is that they basically haven’t gotten any extremely powerful cards for 2 years, and without a few power plays you can’t actually win.
---
I loved that "weirdly specific removals"
---
Admitting playing shaman is a terrible idea in this sub right now
---
Word
---
2 cards, 5-8 for 5 mana... Shaman gets... 10-12 taunt for 1 card in 2 bodies... almost the same
---
Yeah I'm a mathematician, getting my PhD and I've worked with AI some. This isn't too hard a problem, but it doesn't involve calculus. The best way to approach it would be to run Monte Carlo simulation on some different board states, and have some way of evaluating the value of the result. Then take the average of these to find the value of play yogg. This is a pretty common technique for game AI, I'll break it down in some more detail.
---
1) Monte Carlo simulation is when instead of explicitly calculating probabilities of a complicated state occurring, you simulate the process and simply count how many times the complex state occurs. For example, suppose I want to know the likelihood of drawing 3 ascending numbers from a deck of cards. Rather than calculate this, I can easily simulate drawing 3 cards since each has equal probability. Then I can count how often the cards were ascending.
---
2) Finding the value of a board state can be done in many ways. One very crude way would be to give lethal a value of 1, and anything else a value of 0, since it's easy to check if your opponent is dead. A slightly more sophisticated method might involve heuristics like adding up the stats on each side of the board. An easy method would be to feed a neural network a bunch of board states from real games and their results, and have it learn what a "good board" looks like. The best methods would involve simulating the next couple of turns, again using Monte Carlo methods and heuristics such as trading efficiently, and aggregating the value of future board states.
---
There are two reasons I don't recommend explicit calculation. One is the complexity of spell effects. They depend on minions on the board, deathrattles, hand sizes, hero health, really just a huge space of probabilities that won't be easy to deal with. This is referred to as the dimensionality of the problem. The second reason is that there are dozens of spells that can be played at each step. For example, if there are 20 possible spells, the number of possible Yogg Boxes would be 20^10, or around ten trillion. This is called the branching factor of the problem. 
---
Let me know if you have any questions!
---
Got a deck list?
---
Deathrattle rogue gets wrecked by fast aggro decks so there will be a natural way for the meta to even out. Its not nearly as oppressive as galashaman.
---
This has been the strangest RNG night ever for me.
---
How many games?
---
Mindflayer Kaahrj is actually pretty good. But yeah, I largely agree with you and I'm someone who dislikes playing against Priest.
---
The comment say"Less than half". "Less than half" is not "the same". Or am I reading this wrong?

1. Faceless Corruptor now costs 7
---
2. Corrupt Elementalist costs 6
---
3. Invocation of Frost: Freeze an Enemy **Minion**. Invoke Galakron
---
4. Shudderwock - Hall of Fame
---
5. Dragon's Pack - Now Gives +1/+3 if you have invoked twice.  
---
6. Mogu Fleshshaper: Costs 1 less for each minion which died this turn. 
---
7. Necrium Apothecary: Costs 5
---
8. Ancharr: now has 2 durability
---
In wild ladder at rank 5 I've played against 4 Priests in 5 games. Pretty wild I must say. Anyway, I've won every game vs Priest and lost the other one vs Shaman.

Sometimes you just get the nuts and win anyways. I have a full HP Patchwerk win.

Just stop playing priest then
---
I was planning to do a probability analysis of looking at which board state would be the best to play Yogg's box. Looking at the variations, it may be easier (but less complex) to do potentially Yogg-Saron's servant.
---
This is for a math paper which requires an analysis of what's around senior high school or above math, so I initially planned some form of an optimization question with board state and randomized expected value, but the variance might be troubling, so I'm in full reform mindset.
---
Pls don't
---
No...no
---
Done with Xanar#2352
---
And you've done it again
---
This
---
How?
---
The deck can be beaten yes however to admit its power level isnt a bit over the top of some other classes like priest and druid is a lie. It needs to be taken down a peg for other decks to become competitive.
---
From that comment, which was 3 years ago:
---
&gt;As a single archetype, Undertaker Hunter was about 25% of the meta at one point.
---
From the [outof.cards](https://outof.cards) Standard Meta report #15, 1 day ago:
---
&gt;Galakrond Shaman is too powerful, which means, as it usually does, that Galakrond Shaman is too popular. At rank 1, Galakrond Shaman represents an astounding 46.5% of the meta. That’s frankly obscene, and things only get slightly better elsewhere.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Legend - 24.02%  
---
&gt;Rank 1 - 46.55%  
---
&gt;Rank 2 - 38.96%  
---
&gt;Rank 3 - 31.92%  
---
&gt;Rank 4 - 23.85%  
---
&gt;Rank 5 - 14.72%  
---
&gt;Rank 6 - 25.34%  
---
&gt;Rank 7 - 19.88%  
---
&gt;Rank 8 - 17.28%  
---
&gt;Rank 9 - 15.09%  
---
&gt;Rank 10 - 11.72%  
---
&gt;What’s truly surprising is how well-represented Galakrond Shaman has become lower on the ladder. Most dominant decks emerge at Legend, then filter down the ranks over the course of a few weeks as word gets out. Galakrond Shaman has already bucked this trend, instantaneously becoming a force at ranks 6 and below. We rarely see such saturation at lower ranks so early. 
---
Not true. Your trial for crimes against humanity is waiting
---
Look up a decklist for anub rogue. Essentially uses the +3/+3 to all minions deathrattle from anub on the apothecary and runs a lot of cheap minions that can benefit from it
---
The last 24 hours HSReplay data still show Galakrond Shaman as the best deck, with only one bad matchup (OTK Paladin), filtering for Legend rank only.
---
If you filter for Rank 5 to Legend, there are two Tier 1 decks. The second is Aggro Overload Shaman.
---
I don't think those calling for nerfs are the ones who are misguided.
---
I played on mobile over the last 10 days so i didnt track it, id guess 60-70max
---
I actually got killed by a raven deck and it really pissed me off cause I would've won next turn
---
I would rather have a card ban, especially in wild. Would shake the meta every ban cycle. And you could make cards immune to the next ban if banned in this cycle.
---
Not like i'm in a hurry, but wheeeenn??????
---
Oh, oh, I live wild Undatakah Shaman lists. Can you give me a deckcode?
---
This post is the most telling that DoD is the most powerful expansion ever.  All these cards are decent.
---
Well, the card turned out to be a huge offender in arena. Somehow my opponents always had it turn 3.
---
Or just grind the crap out of everything they play. With enough clears...
---
If Shaman got nerfed and Priest got the tools to survive an early-game rush, then I think Kaahrj would be pretty good. But yeah, with Priest being weak and Shaman being overpowered, it doesn't look amazing right now.
---
Priest doesn't count, Priest cards are supposed to be a bit worse than neutrals for Hearthstone.
---
and what happens in all the games you win? they're fair games where you triumph through superior skill and strategy? arena is just mulligan for curve and whoever curves out better cruises to a win unless the other person has big taunts and/or aoes to come back. half the time all it takes to outright win a game in arena is a deathspeaker or evasive wyrm.
---
probably because you play sap - which in itself is a counter......
---
gutted.
---
Oh, cool, you are using WASM. I've been looking for an excuse to get into that, get I'll take a closer look at your code.
---
This is a cool project, it deserves more attention.
---
Thanks for making it.
---
By the time he was done, there were 2 Sith and 2 Jedi - perfectly balanced!
---
You played [[Fate Weaver]] when had one Grave Horror in your hand. 
---
The costs of Grave Horrors aren't supposed to be mirrored throughout the game, without any other consideration.
---
My guess is they don't want to miss the mark on the nerf. If it proves to be insufficient then they will take even more heat. If history is any indication they will nerf the offenders to oblivion.
---
Play face hunter. Its budget and sweet
---
No, sadly
---
Hint: You invoked twice

4/3/6 Dragon | Battlecry: If you've Invoked twice, reduce the Cost of cards in your hand by (1).  
---
You leave my apothecary alone, buster!
---
Usually when I win a game (or lose) a game in arena we chip away at each other’s health, until someone loses, and the other person is at low health. The skill of arena (though I agree there is a lot of luck involved, especially if you get amazing or shit cards for the draw) is making a balanced mana deck with you being able to guess what to do to counter certain play styles. On my turn 9 I had 26 health and he had 23. By my turn 10 I was 0 health and he had 23. Not saying that arena is perfect, but I think that card is  overpowered in arena:
---
I have trouble getting some more complex turns on PC before roping especially when playing Daryll. I can't imagine playing it on mobile.
---
What a shame. Very cool build!
---
I didn't remember aggro shaman super meta back then, but maybe my memory of it is just overshadowed by tunnel trogg aggro shaman :P
---
But 2/5 + 12/12 vs a 9/7 is a big difference. 7 health is not that hard to deal with in the Wild as 12, and even if 12 is dealt with, Rogue still left with some board presence. It's also about consistency - this kind of thing is pretty easy to pull off with Apothecary compared to Barnes, and usually to Voidcaller too, since the card was mostly ran in Reno Warlock.
---
And just to be clear, I don't think that this build is oppressive in Wild or anything, the format has its share of OP stuff and it will just grow crazier and crazier with every set (that's how eternal formats work after all). But I would really closely look at that card in Standard if I were Blizzard.
---
There will be no guaranteed legendary out of 10 wild packs even though you have a new account 😢
---
Yes, you can. Just got legendaries for four wild sets in 6-6-3-6 packs.
---
If everyone had this, it would be a good thing making the games slower, but they only make it slower for... Priest. Actually hunter also had the doesn't have draw weakness but they just... dunno, forgot or something.
---
I can’t play this trash anymore
---
Working as intended. 
---
He can't read the cards text, so he's just generally scared of interacting with Deathrattles except to silence them. 
---
But he'll also prioritize weapon removal over silencing a deathrattle, since that one gets damage off the board.
---
Carried me from rank 7-3
---
\&gt; What if people were able to ban one class for ladder play? 
---
That people would be able to skew the matching system at their favour, a shitty idea.
---
Shaman better get nerfed into the ground
---
Shaman likes elements, I think something with fire
---
There must be a dozen threads on this topic.  Dumb idea still dumb.  Fortunately, it’s never gonna happen.
---
Well, it could be a very interesting experiment, say for one Ranked season, that could potentially change the game. One thing I would ask for: you cannot ban the class you're playing yourself.
---
It’s shocking when you don’t have to VS a shaman on the ladder
---
That seems fair!
---
Yeah it’s nonstop ... wow the nerfs can’t come soon enough for the bad kids to move on to the next OP deck
---
sounds like you wait too long with gala/shudder, or bad mulligan decisions. With random order of battlecries from shudderwock and very limited invoke battlecry cards you should have enough board space for 2 8/8 most of the time.
---
Holy Wrath paladin is good because it counters shamanstone. I don't think that he will do better if shaman is nerfed.
---
Or to replay the kronx battlecry when galakrond
---
I made a mistake by playing ranked after a 3 day break it was a shaman who never once lost tempo then even though I couldn’t keep minions on board because of the 2/1 rushers he throws down a dragon pack. Of course !
---

---
U don´t say....but i wanted to fix the card draw issue\^\^
---
I personally dont bother climbing beyond rank 15, cause rank 10 chest isnt so much better than rank 15's. I think you should be aiming for rank 5 and not settle for rank 10
---
I upvoted because of the caption
---
This deck is easy to tech agaisnt in most cases. Silences or saps will usually garuntee a win. Personally i dont like hiw swingy it is.
---
Flik is useful, anka is one of the two card that make the deck work.
---
Personally, i would like to see a bunch of nerfs in shaman, a few buffs on priest, and that’s about it. Im interested in ranking up yes but i would like to see more variety and people using all the fun decks that came around this expansion
---
That was oddly specific
---
I mean it wasn't on schedule at all iirc. Just because they announce something slightly before instead of just waiting, doesn't make it not an emergency one.
---
Most other invoke cards are tempo losses as well, not for Shaman though
---
Maly is a classic card. He will persist time. He would be the "safer" craft.
---
Stonetusk Boar and Leeroy both tryna get HOFd pre-rotation...
---
I am! But currently finding a lot harder from rank 10 upwards its just shaman...
---
The rarity system is pretty stupid, I mean sure giants and faceless manipulator are pretty unique or they used to be and could be useful in many situations, same with legendaries. But some are just downright stupid, I mean why should I use 1600 dust to craft something like millhouse manastorm or Lillian Voss when they cost the same as Dr boom in all his iterations or cairne? I mean the balancing around them is an issue sure, but I think that it's just an excuse to make something expensive.
---
Oh, that looks like the arm she killed her father with
---
I'm trying out the version with warbringer, and so far I'm doing 2-10. I can't draw apothecary, warbringer or Anka for some reason, and if I do, I'm dead on turn 5 because of all the hyper aggressive Hunter/Warlock decks. Not feeling it tbh.
---
If you add Togwagle scheme, Malygos and other few spell damage cards in your deck you could make an "OTK version" of the classic Galakrond Rogue. But I don't suggest in crafting Malygos. It is a very useful card just for some combos, but there are a lot of other cards (for Rogue or neutral) that u should craft first and can be added in more decks and types, like Leroy or the old Alexsraza for exaple.
---
In addiction you have to consider that the Malygos Galakrond Rogue is not very competitive. It's just a normal Galakrond Rogue, but you have to pull off some usefull cards to just put a funny but not very easy winning condition. I  played that deck 10 games in a row, and when I won i didn't even used Malygos. Funny, but not worth crafting
---
Sure, Lyra is great. But if you're just looking for fun, you could just as well play Priest in the Kobolds and Catacombs adventure (or other solo content) and draft her.
---
I always found the significance of going second on rogue such stupid game design lol.
---
You can see it glowing tho
---
That's not how quotes work.
---
Had the same happening to me recently, post-patch. I think it has to do with bolded text.
---
5/30 that you hard mulligan for Apothecary, if you draw it by turn 4 you'll probably win, could I see it being viable myself? no, but does it work? yes, which is why if you look at any high ranked player they will only have Anubisath in the deck, which got this person rank 3 Legend  [https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/anubisath-deathrattle-rogue-3-legend-cptnkitty-descent/](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/anubisath-deathrattle-rogue-3-legend-cptnkitty-descent/)

I used solarium with it up once without realizing it. Turns 1 mana draw 3 legendaries is pretty good.
---
I assume u are still playing those games right?
---
Grll.
---
Do they not know that the game is intentionally designed poorly so people waste their money? They're literally making big bucks off you getting fucked. 
---
If that idiot is playing priest to deliberately handicap himself, THEN complain how much it sucks, then idk it's like the baby not getting the shapes into the right hole at that point
---
Yeah, the game is free, you don't gotta spend a single cent. So is fortnite, so is league and so is CSGO at this point. How much money do people spend in that game? Triple and quadruple digits. Cosmetics only, a successful business model. The issue with hearthstone is that you are SEVERELY adversely affected for not spending money on it. I forgot how much the mega bundle was. But only streamers , pros , and diehards that know the game in and out are gonna spend that money.
---
If anyone wants to complain about hearthstone being a card game to me, then fuck off cuz being digital means that they have even more reason to be balanced since cards can just be altered instead of print. It costs hearthstone almost nothing to run the game where a real TCG would need to print and retail, yet, I've heard a lot of anecdotal references that MTG balanced the game much better.
---
How can you play Shirvallah when you die turn 6 or 7?
---
there is no way you will have anything close to 5K dust on a new account f2p after a few dozen games or even after reaching rank 25 and dusting everything from the new player rewards packs.

---
why would you ever disenchant him
---
Not even golden LUL
---
if only my cards could collect dust by not disenchanting them
---
r/customhearthstone
---
Yeah but having a 35% winrate playing for pressure is better than the 20% winrate when you play for value.
---
So, I'm running a very similar deck. A few changes though.
---
1. Power Word: Replicate should probably be swapped for Zilliax (if you have him, he's close to rotation so probably not worth crafting) Playing Zilliax on curve into a pyscho-pomp shuts down aggro pretty hard and also generally tends to make quest completion very quick.
---
2. I highly recommend including Shadowy Figure. The synergy with grave rune is a ton of value but it can also work well without it. Pyscho-pomp -&gt; Convincing infililtrator -&gt; shadowy figure also works extremely well since the copy also gets reborn. 
---
Personally, I haven't been using the DS/IF combo and have been relying on netting wins through attrition via the quest HP. That said, I can definitely see the value.
---
Why no corpsetaker package?
---
5 mana 6/6 with rush nerfed 'out of existence'- 'overkill'. 
---
Ahem, I most certantly don't know about what you are talking.
---
Last 5 times i faced secret mages in wild i didnt get any secret removal although they had at least one secret up
---
And the other time when i faced pirate warrior i wanted weapon removal and again no weapon removal 
---
Both cases i had the mana for what i want ( i played a lot of reno palafin in wild before the expansion) so what was working before the expansion now doesnt
---
Shudderwock good, Circlejerk bad
---
&gt;This logic alone makes me wonder how many cool/powerful decks out there just never get discovered.  
---
Wouldn't the absence, not presence, of something like this actually make it harder for a cool deck to get discovered?
---
Mages is surprising, what type are they running?
---
\[\[Sahket Sapper\]\]
---
5 Mana for two 3/3s with Rush on the condition that you have at least a 1/1 on the board.
---
That is a lot weaker than a 5 Mana 6/6 with Rush. *A lot* weaker.
---
In fact, it's weaker than Single-Option Oasis Surger.
---
Guess how much that sees play?

4/4/4 Pirate | Deathrattle: Return a random enemy minion to your opponent's hand.  
---
I think he should prioritize Shadow Madness if you can steal the Deathrattle with just the board. I lost a game a while ago because I traded inefficiently and played Zeph for Shadow Madness and he didn't offer it.
---
Don't worry, they've said the DS/IF combo is being looked at which means one piece of it will almost surely be HoF'd. 
---
And healing doesn't do too much for priest. Healing keeps you alive to the lategame, but the problem priest has consistently had is that it doesn't have anything to actually do in the lategame.
---
I have literally never once dusted a card that wasn't either full refund or an unneeded duplicate. I cannot fathom the reasoning for it. No deck is ever so important to be made that you dust cards you don't have extras of.
---
Only thing that can really deal with it is flik......but good luck having that exactly when you need it.

Everything is a pre-mediated plot to destroy the Hearthstone experience while extracting maximum profits.

Muahah i have four of these mf, cant wait for nerfs. Glad i decide to keep my copies.

silence removes the charge, making Krush a normal 8/8 and it wouldn't be lethal :/
---
my fav is highlander mage. since DoD im on 50% winrate, but i dont care, is really fun to play

---
Very detailed journey down history lane thanks...  
---
When I said 'polished', and 'game quality', I am not talking about the meta at all; we have experienced over the past few months multiple bugs (visual portraits, animations to be disabled upon release, crashes, etc.). Granted, the team is reacting fairly quickly on the important ones!
---
My one point about balance testing was related to the fact that yes, this time, some new cards might need an intervention just a week post release; in the past, it took the community some time to figure out how to identify and play those meta-dominant decks.
---
I had a Rogue shadowstep a Jaraxxus I had from Galakrond summon earlier this morning.
---
I was at 9 health and it completely turned the game.  
---
I'm still baffled.
---
If everyone uses it then it’s equality and no one has an advantage.
---
Interesting, I’ve made it to Rank 5 with a Galakrond Warlock deck with double Jumbo Imp
---
You know that people playing shamans will find another shit deck to annoy others. They always will. No doubt its ridiculous op deck but im sure there will be another soon.
---
Did your invoke cards trigger shaman's Galakrond or the priest one?
---
NONE CAN WITHSTAND THE TEMPEST
---
That’s why you should never DE a legendary ... most will see play before rotation.
---
Blizzard Dev team put here moderating r/fuckdruid.
---
I would guess Kobold actually uses the transform mechanic. They should get his behavior to match his text
---
What secret tech is there in the base set aside from Flare?
---
If it's been around for more than a turn, charge shouldn't matter and it should be able to attack normally right?
---
Just to be clear, I am not saying they neglect QA or any other aspect. But the volume of new content now might be too high for their current staff?? Anyway, overall, I am still glad we have new things coming out frequently!
---
...then become storm!
---
Solo adventure
---
Since the Krush is frozen, I’d bet it didn’t come into play this turn.
---
I've been thinking Megasaur needs to go. Toxfin as single poisonous buff is fine as is, but board-wide poisonous *and* divine shield buffs is stupid and straight up unfair.
---
The 5/4 minion that destroy a random secret (added to the classic set not long ago)
---
Thanks, this is helpful. I’d also like the flair to be maintained so that I can filter this stuff out permanently. Inb4 you’re downvoted to oblivion though for not wanting to consume trash content.
---
Dead for good... until they print some new card that breaks it again.
---
How do face hunters dunk on it, when you can potentially end the game before they even get ur health to half? 
---
I am surprised you named Gala shaman. Look at me guys, my Deck is competely fine because Gala shaman, the most broken deck ever existed is a coin flip?
---
So, where are the counters to a deck that buffs minions in it's hand to 1tko at turn 5?
---
Yeah, they can HoF divine spirit-inner fire combo, they should just replace them with something good. Like the best priest deck last expansion was combo priest, and tbh it got old and boring for me. I don't want the combo to remain the only win condition priest has, other than control/res priest which is not that good in this meta.
---
Yes
---
So that's why Gala Shaman has only a winrate of 99.99%, because of people like you.
---
1. That card is probably going to get nerfed
---
2. That card is really only good is decks built to abuse it or decks built to play long, which Rogue really can't do well.
---
3. Given how late that card'll come down and the deck building restriction that come with playing that, it's fair or at least as fair as Reno Jackson was
---
4. A vanilla three mana 5/3 probably wouldn't see play and neither is that card
---
5. You're also forgetting just how conditional that is or at least should have been
---
6. Yeti on turn one was and probably would still be format warping, but yeti on four has never been.
---
It was frozen by enemy on their turn so it means Crush is on the board for the second owner turn meaning Crush should be awake and able to attack even when silenced (charge effect removed)
---
I've been trying it myself and came to the same conclusion. Drawing "the nuts" likely wins you the game but it's pretty much hopeless against any fast decks if you don't get that big combo. Even slow decks are trouble because they might get their win con assembled while you're praying for the right draw.  
---
 
---
And there's Silence, Secrets, Transforms, etc to interact with the minion most of the time.  
---
  
---
Compare this to Quest Rogue, which is the only deck I've ever played against where the opponent literally didn't seem to react to my plays at all. He played a fun little minigame by himself.
---
Because it adds to the uniqueness and identity of the classes?  Jade was only ever released for 3 classes.  In that same set only a couple classes got highlander support IIRC.  It's not bad that not every class can do everything in every set.
---
It's a bit of stretch to call Galakrand a new mechanic, it's just a hero card.  And we have had plenty of times that only one or two classes got a new hero in any particular expansion. (Boom?)
---
Does it happen if you are on wlan as well? If not you might be on limited data.
---
Did you try to reinstall the app? That helped me with a couple bugs.
---
Consider writing a ticket to blizzard support maybe they are able to help further.
---
daily post of the portrait bug ...
---
I care. No one cares that you don’t care though.
---
its like hunter with the opposite hero power and no early game
---
No, MechMage never really stopped running it. It was played consistently in a top tier meta deck.
---
And?
---
Seen that people are dropping more taunts now and popping
---
in Veranus to top my curve has actually been alright. Let’s me rapid fire or leper gnome into a big ward to push a bit more damage. Not entirely sold yet may not be worth it
---
More reliable counters are pirate warrior, face hunter, and galakrond warlock. The rogue sort of piddles around dropping 1/1s until turn 4, then needs to kill a 2/5 before it gets the buff (assuming it even drew the 2/5 on curve). By that time it's too late to recover.
---
Yeah, I only play standard for the quests now, most of my time ist stuck in other games or battlegrounds.
---
Its Snapping time.
---
Yeah, so does he give non destruction removal when he sees deathrattles or not? The op is a sign of inconsistent behaviour, assuming zephrys doesn't know what the desthrattles are.
---
dont think so. zoo galakrond is bonkers too and will run amok over this kind of rogue
---
Highlander mostly. I mean I haven't played much, only through ranks 16-13, but I've literally seen only 3 shamans. Hope our good luck doesn't run out.
---
Not if Blizzard plans ahead and limits that. 50/50 chance they will, and if they don’t it would be a random hero card’s hero power
---
Deleted the post tho huh
---
There are at least seven or eight cards that will need to be nerfed for this balance change to be even close reasonable.  And I don't that they'll do that so....
---
Maybe in another month when they do a second or third pass on balance
---
I've been playing dragon Reno priest in wild. It's honestly pretty good. The only issue I've noticed is that Dragonqueen Alexstrasza is significantly weaker in wild than in standard.
---
I do not understand why you wouldnt allow hs memes throughout the year, whats the point?
---
Well either summarize or just say if it's worth coming back to latter. If it's just Thijs bitching about his luck.
---
Right so 57 more minutes, got it
---
Still Dr. Boom
---
&gt; If they can't, then it's not a realistic solution and their complaints might not be that legitimate compared to the silent majority who likes how this subreddit is run.
---
First I will say, a new expansion just came out a week ago, so the meta is still shaking out. If you have dust and gold to work with, be careful of any crafting decisions you make. The meta is still rapidly evolving.
---
As for decks, Galakrond Shaman is absolutely dominating the meta right now with a 60% plus winrate. It is not a difficult deck to pick up and play but like any deck it does take some skill to master. A word of warning, there are nerfs coming this week for Shaman.
---
This is your average Galakrond Shaman decklist (Thisbis a link to HSreplay, not a decklist code): [Galakrond Shaman](https://hsreplay.net/decks/oVHkEorMH6qMT3I5wlWYyf/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD) 
---
Other powerful and popular decks are [Deathrattle Rogue](https://hsreplay.net/decks/TzNgjAn3YR8UFX4L1DJGj/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD) , [Pirate Warrior](https://hsreplay.net/decks/QhY0l3gfmdpN7nlqvdQJTc/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD) , and [Highlander Hunter](https://hsreplay.net/decks/pPfPVuL8LzJeu6gGYJoo6b/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD) .
---
Those are just scratching the surface of all the decks coming out of the meta right now. Like I said, it is rapidly evolving, this is an exciting time in Hearthstone.
---
If you are a discord user, there are several discord's you could use for info, if you or anyone is interested PM me.
---
Also if you are looking for someone to play with and give you tips or just co-op with, I'm willing to help.
---
My battletag is ITSMEMIKEV#1107.
---
Coin concede
---
Zeph doesn't read. Same thing happens with prep/zeph
---
I've found Sea Giant is just better in most cases.
---
I think you underestimate the power of nerfs, there's multiple ways to go about it.
---
For example, simply removing Rush from Shaman's Invoke, probably drops the class win's percentage by a couple points alone.
---
Amazing
---
You can stop playing, you know.
---
I'm calling it will be 6 Mana. Such a powerhouse of a deck, that I'm sure that Blizzard will nuke this from orbit.
---
Decklist?
---
Zephrys doesn’t read any of that, as has been explained.  The opponent’s health is 13.  If you want Zeph to recognize 8 attack as lethal your opponent needs to be at 8 or less health, not just have a board state where “if I do a bunch of stuff then he’d be at 8.”  This is not a bug, it is user error.
---
F5
---
Charge isn't the issue, the deathrattle mana cheating is. As long as a minion whose mana cost mostly goes into the deathrattle exists, Rogues will be able kill you by high rolling Necrium cards. It just so happens that Apothecary is the fastest way right now.
---
No you don't care, if you care about this then you don't have a job or anything else going on inside your head
---
Is this good enough to get slotted into secret mage in wild? Could be nutty.
---
&gt;"I know how/why it happened, but clearly my cursor is on the enemy minion visually"
---
I’ll take that bet
---
...yet
---
Have seen this while browsing my collection and honestly thought something was wrong on my end. That's hilariously bad.
---
Its to help deal with divine shields, the damage could be one and reason for buying it would be the same, but even with that I dont think its good enough
---
Some tournament organizer in China tweeted that they would be live tomorrow. Make of that what you will.
---
Today isn’t over yet. No reason to lose hope so soon
---
Bliz wanted dragons to feel powerful.  Therefore, they made a bunch of broken OP cards,  and they balanced them around draw statistics.  So if you always got your card, you would almost always win.  But you get your card(s) 50% ish... So.. balance.  But no fun because everything is RNG.
---
Find out next time on Dragonball Z
---
paladin can give to his oponent 10 mana ! o/
---
But a 6cost just to deal with divine shield? Especially considering that you are forced to play demons as well
---
It’s a forbidden class that was banished for it’s crimes in the KotFT meta. I hear they grow cute little trees in a farm upstate now.
---
I'm not saying make it a clown fiesta. But they are hardly making changes and now is the perfect time to be doing it.
---
It has a new card.
---
Most likely your client froze
---
It\`s win rate, or what?
---
I’m not gonna lie. I can only win with quest hunter
---
Pretty well in my Gala Rogue currently. If you play it early, it's also good at tricking people into wasting their removal because nobody realizes how bad the average Legendary is.
---
Turned out he left the game lol
---
Well, with every pogo you pick, there is one less in the pool + there are 15´copies of each other t2 minion. Kinda hard to find tons of pogos...
---
Yes... they never touched dopplegagster, so thats why the shudderwock combo is still possible in wild.
---
Thats what I said
---
Galakrond Shaman
---
Their*
---
If this guy is conceding to a single vanilla 7/7, he's going to have a rough time facing Deathrattle Rogue.
---
It wouldnt be rare if they don't know what to nerf yet
---
It was usually pretty bad though, this deck is legit almost as strong as shaman, it high rolls super hard
---
Okay! If the nerfs come before the end of this week, DM me your favorite pizza place and your order. I will place a take out order in your name for you to pick up. Vice versa if they don't come this week?
---
This is more fun than the actual game has been since the expansion dropped.
---
1. The card hasn't done anything yet
---
2. I doubt you'd be able to make an Elemental Mage deck work with or without a five mana Arcanosaur
---
3. I don't care
---
4. So, Embiggen should get a nerf before its even done anything, but Surrender to Madness, a very similar card, should be buffed?
---
5. You really might as well remove the card from the game entirely at that point.
---
   1. An inner fire as you describe is about as useful as a Mage Spell whose only effect is "Freeze a minion you control."
---
6. If the deck end up being as strong as people believe it will be, sure
---
7. You not being a fan of zero cost spells doesn't mean they all need to be changed
---
8. I don't care. It won't make the card competitive
---
9. See above
---
10. Skipping Shaman generally since its been done to death
---
11. I'd rather wait and see if Pirate Warrior is even decent post-shaman hits before suggesting nerfs
---
12. Been talked about to death
---
Did you play wild this expac or last? It has not been bad. Definitely highrolls harder and earlier.
---
Yup Yup. I agree.
---
I see Priest as 
---
Good at: Midrange and Control
---
Decent at: Tempo and Zoo
---
Bad at: Purely Aggro
---
Also Shadowform and Shadow oriest should be represented Way way more in the class.
---
If this went back to its original form, chromatic egg priest would be OP. Oh wait, nope, still way worse than rogue.
---
Something has definitely changed. I failed to get Hex against an Obsidian Statue with 4 mana left after dropping Brann+Zep. Fortunately the 2xSpellbreakers I got were eventually enough to wreck the Big Priest, but I really would have preferred that spell.
---
Because the cards are made to be played with galanrond. How can you trigger an ability of a card that doesn’t exist in your deck. The invoke ability is an ability of galalrond not the minion
---
This is cringe
---
Demons biggest weakness is divine shield poison, tier 6 is there to make itself a late game play with demons, certainly this would raise its current 8% first place winrate, and people play nefarian to deal with the same problem, I think tier 6 to basically have a heropower on board is ok
---
think about what the word invoke even means. if you’re not invoking anything then you’re not “invoking”
---
Without a rather major change to the rules of Hearthstone itself, that change means nothing.
---
I'm guessing announcement earlyish tomorrow followed by the patch a few minutes later.
---
Try out Deathrattle rogue with Anubis. It’s very broken mate.
---
"I am trying to do an odd Rogue deck, and for that I really don't need Baku."
---
They are meant to be cards to limit their effectiveness outside of the deck.  Imagine if every Shaman archetype could run Dragon's Pack.
---
Not even commenting on the nerds/buffs but I thought it was funny you spelled Rogue wrong every single time.
---
You assume blizzard even has a clue as to what they are even doing. There is no way in hell that this expansion was even playtested. It seems like it was developed by AI and they just said "ship it, the players will sort it out, we aren't going to PAY people to test this when the players will do it for free".
---
I honestly dont see why you would expect this to work. Imagine back in whispers if people were complaining that ancient shieldbearer wasnt giving armor. "I have no cthun in my deck but if I did he would be 10 attack, why doesnt it proc?"
---
Going to try it mate  
---
Ty for the deck
---
To be fair, there have been a lot of historical firsts lately.
---
It's quite rare that a game will be perfectly balanced so you'll have to take changes. Plus, even if it was balanced, you have to add new content otherwise it gets boring and repetitive but eventually when you add new content it will break that state of balance. 
---
So when you add new content you have to make sure to follow up with regular balance changes to make the necessary adjustments so the game doesn't end up with one overpowered class or tribe and becoming painful one-dimensional.
---
Or at the very least, if they don't add new content regularly, they need to make minor changes to the current content so keep it feeling fresh (but new content has to come eventually).
---
Dw, I didn't get it anyway.
---
Is the one with Catrina and Vargoth?
---
What's the list you got?
---
What are those cards
---
The horror...the horror...wait, every shaman archetype already can...cause galakrond is the only archetype of shaman I ever see!
---
Most of my priest victories are from the Raza Priest era, I stopped playing hs for a long time and some friends that were playing it made me come back in Rastakhan

Probably not today, nerf news usually drops @ 10 AM PST.
---
Nope. Nerfs hit tomorrow per a Chinese source.
---
You don’t need him to make the deck work though. 
---
Answer is you probably weren’t around to pick him up when he was free.
---
Maybe you didn't login when we obtain sathovarr
---
Repent!
---
Far from the most toxic deck in hearthstone history. It’s literally worse freeze mage from wild and far more room for counterplay than face hunter/tunnel trogg shamans from back in the day.
---
Wow, good guys and bad guys teaming up to defeat a greater threat? Never heard Blizzard do that story before! /s
---
Nice shop. However, broken metas is common in card games. There will always be a top deck. If this last 4 months, then its rotten. Been a week, chill out, nerfs incoming
---
None just roll
---
Buy 1 sell it then roll.
---
I had a lot of fun with galvadon but lynessa was really the card that made the deck work to the limited extent that it did.
---
Atleast something is finally happening.
---
I was AFK anyways haha
---
I'm experiencing the game running much more smoothly myself on  mobile, so it could be that your device didn't benefit as much as others did.
---
Don't listen to that guy he is extremely good in Holy wrath paladin, try relogging or contact blizzard support if that doesn't work, you can't craft it so there is no way your not supposed to have it
---
That would work, but it should just be a minion at this point.
---
You know, that's a pretty good argument. I see "counterplay" as something you can do explicitly within the context of a match—so in terms of altering your behavior to reflect what your opponent is, rather than altering your strategic options to reflect what your opponents might be—but I can see this perspective.
---
That's an opinion you just gave me. I'm not worried about wild, the trash bin of history. And OTK mage never hit the WR that OTK paladin now has or the prevalence on ladder.
---
Who cares when they tell us what the nerfs will be, nothing will change either way until they actually go live.
---
If you get two zolas couldnt you just bounce them? One gives you a golden zola which should give you two zolas since golden, then each zola nets you one gold when you sell it and you get infinite golds of megasaur or whatever. Card cant exist in bg
---
You need to repost this and flair it, thanks for translating
---
For real. Everyone’s complaining about this deck but I looked in hsreplay and the normal mechanical whelp tempo rogue is still higher winrate than this deck. It’s highrolly for sure and not consistent.
---
It has been a problem for a lot of people, they're saying that it will be fixed next patch
---
"Dad legend", haha can definitely identify, congrats!
---
Are you actually a dad?
---
This would honestly be so cool tbh.
---
Thanks! It’s more of a personal achievement than anything
---
Yeah I enjoy it, I have prob 10k+ Matches with old quest as well.
---
Quests are kinda my deal and it’s how I got 30k subs so chillax Buds
---
I understand that, but it shouldnt make a difference whether you lost by 0 hp or by concede. Win is win. Its not gaming the system. I have had it twice where my opponent pulled this shit off in turn 4 and i conceded both times - because I knew I lost.
---
It’s very rare and really baity lol.
---
A single non-golden copy of Sathrovarr is automatically given to the player the first time they log into Hearthstone after November 5th, 2019.
---
A golden copy of Sathrovarr can only be obtained by purchasing a ticket or Virtual Ticket to BlizzCon 2019.
---
Both the normal and golden versions of Sathrovarr are uncraftable and cannot be crafted or disenchanted
---
This is a quet from hs wiki. Was there any Time limit? It looks more like a bug for me.
---
Done. Is it up??. let me know. thanks again.
---
Dad legend is just what rank 5 is called
---
Cause he’s always on the verge of being meta worthy, then some new card comes out that completely blows him out of the water and I have bad impulse control.
---
I actually dropped Barnes before the nerf and found it made the deck more consistent.
---
Nah murloc paladin brings out a board with like MAX 5 health so you can board clear pretty easily still.... consistently pulling 1 mana 10/10 + minions with charge by turn 10 is absolutely ridiculous. I use the term highroll if I can beat the deck about 50/50. I played against deatrhrattle rogue about 15 times yesterday and lost every. single. time.
---
Oh shit, have we already moved on from Rogue? Just when I thought it was safe to put my pitchfork away. Sigh...
---
Just means you’re a good pilot, congrats 😉
---
....... you don’t need to him to make the deck work doesn’t equal don’t run him he’s bad....
---
It's a bit like the auto-chess games that a number of other franchises have. You buy minions from a tavern each turn rather than having a constructed deck, and fights are all automated.
---
My F5 key can finally rest
---
But isn’t the idea dad’s don’t have the free time to make it to legend so just go to rank 5?  If you have the time it’s just rank 5.
---
Yeah it's up
---
Damn, I was hoping the changes would be effective today. Still, this brings joy.
---
Yep only for literally no coins, this was free
---
How do you have so much gold?
---
Wait what's broken about novice engineer?
---
Priest got nothing in the new expansion, and wasn't that good to start with.
---
You just stole this off the front page
---
A Dragon's pack?!
---
Maybe it's because your phone is shit?
---
Not true at all. Bunch of the cards they buffed actually saw/see play after the buff in T2 decks and affected the meta without being broken as you claimed. For example OTK paladin wouldnt exists/will become a trash deck if crystology didnt get buffed, so by buffing one card they allowed an entire deck to function. Another card is thunderhead it allowed bloodlust shaman to become an actual T2-T1 deck without breaking the meta.
---
Yes there will be bad cards nobody disagreed but some cards are interesting and they are seeing 0 play because they didnt get balance right so why they shouldnt they buff them ??
---
Turn 1: 1 1 drop
---
Turn 2: 2 1 drops
---
Turn 3: 3 1 drops
---
...
---
Turn 10: 10 1 drops
---
Because its not opinion based? All classes got either Highlander or Galakrond, of which statistically the Highlander Decks are better. So there is absolutly no reason to complain about other classes getting "NOTHING" which is simply not true. You can say you would have liked Galakrond for Mage or something more, but anything else is just plain stupid. Especially you, for white knighting bullshit and saying its opinion. Classic
---
who dat?
---
YES
---
Mana wyrm isn't an elemental and never was
---
Like what? Combo? The only good deck that Priest has had for five billion years?
---
Almost every Priest player is sick of combo. It's a fucking boring lame deck and it's the only viable archetype Priest has had for millennia. At some point you have to admit that a class having the exact same deck for a year without any other deck being good is a problem. Combo isn't even doing great right now anyway.
---
It’s one of my favourite cards in my highlander hunter deck. 
---
Helps me to slow down those bogus Dragon Shamen decks right now.
---
Right. One turn. But this deck didn't kill in one turn. It's one turn to play the card, usually one to activate the deathrattle, and then a third to actually do the thing. That's three turns. And the first two turns can be stopped. It's like saying shade of nax can one turn kill if you leave it on board for 30 turns first. What makes an OTK is the inability of the opponent to deliberately counterplay.
---
They should announce what cards they will nerf tommorow.
---
Specifically Shamans teching Earth Shock for the rogues, the problem is drawing it when you need it.
---
If it gets Sapped it they can play it again and get the effect assuming they haven't drawn the 2nd Anubisath yet.
---
Yeah the drawing it is the issue but it’s not like the rogue doesn’t have that issue as well. He does have to draw his good cards as well
---
tbf priest mains have every right to cry their class has the lowest win-rate in literally every format right now like wtf how could dis be?
---
When he got nerfed for a full dust refund
---
I’m just chillin over here with my quest paladin like whuuuut
---
It seems like we're going to be seeing exactly that when the Solo eventually drops, since it promises to add new cards, like how Doom in the Tomb injected the meta with wild cards.
---
I clicked on this not realizing it was heartstone subreddit...my god that twist at the end...I was expecting something cheezy from pintrest or something.
---
What even is the point in interactions in hearthstone? 99%of the time it's people bm'g me.
---
Just give us an optional text chat comms or nothing
---
I think it's because the discount is applied to the card after it's drawn but transmogrifier triggers in the middle of that, not sure.
---
2 8/8s with rush on turn 7? Seems balanced.
---
Not all of them are meme cards. toxic reinforcements has spawned what might be one of the most aids face hunter decks ive ever seen, great winrates, fast wins, no interaction from your opponent.
---
Galakrond is only op in shaman, and they're supposed to nerf this week
---
&gt; Galakrond Shaman has one bad matchup across all archetypes, and it's a very niche deck (holy wrath pally): 
---
But why you lying for?
---
 Pirate Warrior and Face Hunter. 
---
 Seriously, Face Hunter came out of nowhere in the last few days to start getting ridiculous win percentages. It's one of those decks people will like to face roll with and defend their choice of "I just want to rank up fast, quick games are fun to me". 
---
 I think we might not have heard about the nerfs because there are decks like Face Hunter that only shot up to the top after the nerfs were announced and they realized they might need to address more things than they though. I think even as late as Sat/Sun the top hunter decks were Quest/Highlander. The hunter rankings were completely shaken up in the last 48 hours.
---
Its not played that much in wild... if at all right now.
---
There's potentially a similar problem with the fact that the corruptor copy retains the original's buffs, as Anubisath Deathrattle Rogue lies waiting to dominate the meta once Shaman is toppled.
---
&gt; it still being played in like every deck
---
It's not in any Galakrond Shaman deck that I've seen.
---
Something changed?
---
Fucking scumbag
---
Hunter's Mark wasn't broken until Rush became a mechanic.
---
Those were the Brode days everyone longs for. No idea why.
---
Maybe unrelated but while I understand that they only wanna use keywords in a single expasion it's really sad that qurst pala just wont get any additional reborn minions to add.. Really lame I think
---
Mogor destroy
---
Theres an old clip somewhere where Reynad is explaining why priest should always remain dumpster tier. I think the design team took that advice to heart.
---
I went against the top 2 guys with crazy openers back-to-back 4 times
---
Shaman has a strong early game with Galakrond rushes and battlecry effects and high roll into 8 Mana evolve.  It has a strong mid game with even more rushes, overload mechanics  or double battlecry quest.  It has a strong late game with Galakrond Turn and Shudderwock Turn.  So it has no weaknesses that can be exploited.
---
How about potion of madness?
---
I feel like the only good things priest really had (consistently) was Mind Blast which is now HoF and divine shield inner fire. 
---
I love Priest but divine inner fire has always felt bad to play since its so dull to fight against.
---
i'm just happy all the battlegrounds posts are gone
---
wow man, that's extremely lucky, u/593shaun said it best. Out of 35 legendaries you got 14 (and the galakronds) lucky you!!
---
Mom: We have odd paladin at home
---
Odd paladin at home:
---
And the history repeats... how many times we had shaman being op at the start of the expansion and then nerfed to shit?
---
Yeah, I get that... but it sure goes against the idea of wishing for the perfect card.
---
You can also imagine new cards might come into the game, entirely new types of cards. Whether or not Zephrys will be able to handle those is entirely based on whether they keep maintaining his code.
---
Man I thought it’s Chillmaw 😫. Its been too long.
---
Would the card be better if it had the conditional that you had to already be Galakrond for the buff? Or is the efficiency just too busted?
---
You sound like a Shaman/rouge main, lol jk. But really preist had 2 decks that were good . Big priest was nerfed and made way too slow and combo has been hit or miss for a while and the new expansion didnt even add anything worth while to the deck. Priest got the metaphorical shaft on this expansion for sure comparatively to the other classes. Even comparing the galakrond decks priest has the worst one early but the strongest in the late . But the problem is getting to turn 9 means you are probably already dead or almost there. I am not complaining, I can see why people would ' cry too much', they gave all other classes some form of aoe, hard removal other tools they never had and priest doesn't really have an aggro or a strong enough early game.158
---
I'd say that has the panache required for the job. Well done!
---
I think this gotta happen once in a while in an RNG based game, but yeah, would be better if it didn't add itself.
---
Faceless Corrupter 5 mana to 7
---
Corrupted Elementalist 5 mana to 6
---
Galakrond the Tempest 8/8s to 6/6s
---
Necrium Apothecary 4 mana to 5
---
Self defeating argument?! Zalae demonstrates the power of shaman and it explodes day 2. You would have to be blind not to see that the popularity he sparked day 1 ignited the flame day 2 when the stats came in.
---
Normally a deck like that would hit closer to day 3 or 4. I'm not saying it solved the meta, that would be a retarded claim. But even you admit that there was only 1 day of experimentation until the first power deck hit
---
Res priest in doom in the tomb was desperating to fight against
---
Thats clearly not what you said you idiot. You said mage is broken now.
---
Learn to articulate your point dumb fck - you're directly contradicting yourself - moron.
---
I mean people dont play video games to have fun
---
You must feel like a bit of an idiot now aye?
---
Bet it hasn’t been so great vs face hunter, pirate warrior, or DR rogue. Just don’t see it surviving in a fast meta like this
---
I dusted all my wild shit every rotation. This rotations gonna be different. I love wild, can’t wait to expand my collection
---
A RED Spy is in the base?!
---
One summons automatically and the other needs a target. You should understand this
---
This is definitely true and it’s hyperbolic to say that the prerelease streams solve the meta. I don’t think it’s farfetched to say that it expedites  the process though.  Without it, we may have an extra day or two of the new-release experimentation.
---
Invoke Galakrond to have Players rushing to befriend you.
---
A six week break completely transformed the game for me. I'd recommend it.
---
Your necriums and anubisaths together giving you 1 mana 13/13 charge or sometimes even more.
---
There's a legendary called whizbang that straight up gives you a random deck start of game based on the current deck recipes so that would be a good place to start if you want to play standard.
---
Are you me? It's not that bad.
---
nice goldens :D Murozond needs some work though, he doesn't play battlecries and targets are random, not that big of a threat (and he's priest)
---
If I vs any of those, you're right. It has been mostly Shaman on ladder on my end, unfortunately.
---
I think misunderstand “potential.” It’s okay, it’s a hard word to grasp. It speaks of something that isn’t there yet. 
---
I didn’t say Dragon is bad, I said it’s not broken. 
---
Cyclone has always had some good highrolls, and it’s gotten some more. 
---
I’ve played a homebrewed cyclone mage mostly this season and it’s gotten me from 9 up to 4. (I’m a Legend player for reference, I took a few months off and I’m just coming back.) 
---
The meta is far from settled and even more will change with balance updates. Lists are far from refined. 
---
All I’m saying is keep your eye out for it. I’m pretty partial to my list and it’s done me well so far.
---
Of all the things wrong with shaman currently, generating additional shudders isn't one of them. Not compared to 16/16 rush and a free arcanite reaper. Especially since they're 9 mana so you play 12 of them over 2 turns. 
---
Maybe if the meta becomes so heavily control that surviving the second galakrond is feasible for most decks. But not right 6.
---
Can confirm that I do this fairly often as a paladin
---
I always get two savagery from that dragon that gives one cost spells. :(
---
Both cheat cost duo combo are considered busted within its rotation.
---
I said the exact same thing in another thread &amp; was downvoted to hell lol. No excuse for this card to still be in standard, when it's only used for OTK combos, which Blizzard has said numerous times that they don't like.
---
Yes, but it is possible, but it’s not like you’ll be able to return and do anything you want.  You’ll need to complete dailies, and it might take a few months to catch up without spending.  If you’re willing to accept that, you should have no problem.
---
In April, 3 sets are rotating out, so I would be working for the next few months towards then— collecting 6 sets of card is hard.
---
As for meta, a set launched last week, and nerfs are coming this week, so it’s a little unknown.
---
Also consider playing wild, where you’ll have more cards.
---
This. Most GK decks dont even run anything that could bounce Shudderwock back to hand. If they turn a 2/1 rush into a 6/6 thats fine, if they got a 5/4 with rush instead Shudder would be even more powerful lol
---
&gt; the people brandishing stats to justify their position aren't looking to have their minds changed because they're just here to yell into the void. 
---
Yeah I'm definitely picking up that vibe, have people telling me Necrium Vial is bad when it's literally in two top 10 legend decks, from the responses I've gotten you would assume everyone here is Rank 1 Legend.
---
&gt; In the meantime I've got decks to counter and it's a pretty good spot to be as a brewer imo. 
---
It's always a good time :) I remember the last weeks of the previous expansion just dominating with my custom Quest Paladin.
---
Not to mention before that silence combo was pretty good during RoS, and wall priest was oppressively t1 for a few months before rotation, and gallery priest had been at least decent since BP.
---
There's also a brand new f2p mode called Battlegrounds that is extremely fun and easy to learn.
---
None feel any better tbh. I’ve had nothing but dr rogue today at it’s just as frustrating
---
It has a 43% wr id hardly call that potential.
---
Not the only problem, just the main problem. Then comes apothecary, and then faceless (imo).
---
From what I saw it looked like one of the dragon shrines in Dragonblight which is an area in Northrend. Sind was revived much further north of Dragonblight.
---
It's not a bug but that does not mean that it should be player error. Sure, Zeph only would give you it if you had lethal on board but that's not what Zeph's description says. Zeph's description is "discover a perfect card". If you've been running through this reddit, you would know that that's not actually what Zeph does but if you haven't, and don't exactly understand how it works, you wouldn't know what you had to do. If it says "perfect card", you may assume it means "perfect card"
---
You have become they very thing you swore to destroy
---
yeah. the decks it ends up in might not be overpowered always, but definitely not the design blizzard wants to push.
---
Close but it gave charge to the minions when they were played. Your card text was actually a proposed nerf before blizzard just nuked it instead
---
This happened to me yesterday, had a full board of 7 with this, and opponents MCT stole only deathwing. Still won
---
Not really. For one it's slow, does nothing the turn you play it Hearthstone has gotten faster and faster especially in wild this card just doesn't cut it. This card used to be fun if not competitive before defile was released and the devs nerfed it because of the potential interaction. Now with the way the deathrattle sequence works it doesn't work with spirit singer umbra like it used to where before it would generate a full board.
---
If you want to play something similar but basically better in every way you can play a discard warlock that focuses on discarding cruel dinomancer and resummoning that into a full board. [[Cruel dinomancer]]
---
Last time it was a problem was actually test subject OTK priest, which was almost universally hated by the community.
---
You can always just play Wild. You can use your old cards there and there are some good cheap decks. 
---
Standard is Shamanstone atm till the nerf hits in like a few days.
---
It's at all ranks. That's exactly the deck OP is talking about.

---
6/5/5 | Deathrattle: Summon a random minion you discarded this game.  
---
Again, current win rate has nothing to with potential. That’s not what potential means. 
---
Secondly, I feel like I’m 6 months back. Understand what your data aggregate site means. It’s not the end all. There’s a large error in the data that isn’t even discussed. (And if you want to disagree, ALL data has errors. Data is much better when it’s error is accounted for)
---
I think part of it is jealousy that some people get to play early.  A meta can’t be solved by 20-30 people playing against each other (and most were playing battlegrounds in the days before the xpac anyway).
---
I've been playing face hunter a lot the past few days and have never felt Zilliax to be a problem or difficulty for the deck. Its three additional damage you need to get through, or worst case scenario, you dont draw your spells, six. Not a big deal for that deck.
---
Shaman? I've blown every shaman I've played against out of the water. Who cares if they play two 8/8s with rush on 7 when you've already got two 7/7s and two 11/10s and 20 damage from hand. The only things that seem to counter Rogue are good Pirate Warrior openers and really bad draw rng.
---
Please tell me I am not the only one that tried to remove the dust from my screen near the 'n' in 'don't'
