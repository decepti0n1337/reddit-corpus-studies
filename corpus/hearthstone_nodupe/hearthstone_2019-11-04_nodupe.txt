Priest has the best removal of any class now. A deck full of removal needs a way to generate value, and this is it.
---

---
Rogues is strong also, but Rogue doesn't have the survivability to cope with a long game, and Priest does. So  a Priest Galakrond deck might actually be more viable.
---
---
---
She consistently won the shaman and Druid mirrors and wiped the floor with her hunter deck, very very deserved. Hearthstone has a lot of RNG but you could clearly see she was outplaying her opponents.
---
Just play burgle rogue. Most of your opponents will be shaman so you'll burgle a bunch of shaman cards.
---
Something around 8.5, but between 8.5-9, thus closer to 9. The actual number of opened legendaries can be 4 and it can be 20.
---
The average would have been exactly 8.5 if you'd get the legendary exactly on the 10th opened pack every time.  However since mostly you'd open the first legendary earlier than the exact 10th pack the average is higher.
---
If you want to be that pedantic.
---
You fuckers copied Mtg
---
This would be true if she played one duel and got a great evolve or something. She played 5 sets or something and won every single one of them.
---
That‚Äôs not luck.
---
I get what you mean.
---
The gadgetan version and the new, uncraftable/undisenchantable version are considered different cards?
---
Thats a big mistake from their part. I know they cant be both put in the same deck (they are considered the same in deckbuilding purposes) but its clear they forgot about the scenario where getting one of the cards in its original version into your deck trough random effects while running the new free version is possible in wild/arena.
---
lol post it to scrub quotes
---
And a new card is revealed:
---
***''Burned to crisp''***  featuring George and Karl :P :P
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Btw your story is awesome m8. I d really like to hear more Hs stories coming from cards that connect to each other (i think Un'Goro had many of them). Sometimes they re really nice stories being told but i totally miss them
---
uh oh
---
Also thanks, glad you liked it.  I love it when stories are told through unconventional means i.e. flavor text, another example of this that I love is the flavor text on each of the spellstones from Kobolds and Catacombs, and I'd love if they did that more.
---
That's a good point.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to tell people that something that just happened, happened a long time ago and yeah you‚Äôre right blizz didn‚Äôt make that statement they made a lame ass no-apology, apology. You have the right to your but you don‚Äôt have the right to make believe something that happened a couple of days is ancient history. Have a nice dayüëç
---
Its going to be cool to cube/clone it and then hero power once for an insane arrow storm.
---
No. They're all trolls. Nobody can be that toxic IRL. Not without being constantly punched in the face.
---
I like your optimism. I don't share it, but I like it. üòÅ

Run darkness in evolve shaman to play around it
---
What if you have played galakrond, but soon after you replace the hero or hero power with another (whether by quests or other hero cards)?
---
What will invoke do then? Trigger the original galakrond HP?
---
What if you played a galakrond, changed HP with a quest and have a remaining galakrond in deck? Which HP does invoke trigger then?
---
What if you played two galakronds, changed HP and have no galakronds in deck? Which HP does invoke trigger now?
---
I fucking love Frostlich Jaina, Deathstalker Rexxar and Dr. Boom Mad Genius.
---
To answer all three of your questions, since they all involve an active Galakrond, Invoke will be based on the active Galakrond Hero, regardless of if the Hero Power is replaced by Finley or Sideshow Spelleater.  If replaced by a non-Galakrond Hero, it will still use Invoke based on it.
---
Warlock Zoo's back, fuck yeah
---
Better plot than WoW
---
I like the random capitalization,it makes it funnier to read as him screaming and then going quiet.  Especially the "YOU DO REALISE that" bit.
---
Although he's apparently playing a counter to your deck and yet it's a bad deck...
---
Also apparently this guy doesn't get that people can play fun decks and drop ranks that way and don't have to try hard all the time.
---
Though the best part was the "you thought I lost?" part as... well, he conceded, so yes he did.
---
I do have to ask though, did it look like he was playing a reno mage or a weird secret mage, or...?
---
[removed]
---
How dare you play a tier 3 meta deck!  You MONSTER!
---
In keeping with history, once a woman wins something or women become dominant in a field, men insist that it wasn't important in the first place.
---
Be grateful, they're normally not this insane or entertaining.
---
Wait, we get 6 free legs? I thought it was just 1 of the 6?
---
Malchezar puts 5 in your deck at the start
---
This dude is the reason so many people reject my requests... I usually just wanna say gg to someone who played really well or after a game that went off the rails. Either that or apologize for how gross I feel after so shaman high rolls.
---
My iPad crashes like crazy but iPhone 5c is perfect
---
Oh yeah I didn‚Äôt think about that, that‚Äôs very true
---
Excited about it! I found TFT a little barring so this is perfect (much more familiar with HS)
---
they releasing battlegrounds this tuesday? i thought they will wait to release it with DoD
---
Invoke requires a Galakrond, so no, it won't work.  However, the League classes have Sidequests instead.
---
Also, RoS already had this split with Lackeys and Twinspell.
---
No. It wouldn't.
---
Cards with Invoke might as well be restricted to the EVIL classes.
---
That is unless you generate one of the five Galakrods as one of the League classes.
---
Some day I‚Äôll be just like you.
---
I didn‚Äôt realize the Side Quest were for the Hero classes, thanks for telling me!
---
Because he gets to do 6 immediately. And his divine shield might let him live to get 6 next turn?
---
That's the only way I can see it..
---
There's probably a taunt anyway
---
~~Arcane~~ Sand Golem
---
Free content bad? Would it be better if there were 18 legendaries other than the Galakronds?
---
Yeah, you can have your Durdley valuepile, won‚Äôt do you much good when secret Mage bulldozes you on turn 6.
---
Nope
---
Wild.

Materia#6805 NA trading 80g quest. I will show the quest but you go first. Check my history I have done this many times before.
---
EDIT DONE THANKS ISTP
---
For something that they did a month ago and has been posted to the sub 5-10 times? No, I don't think so.
---
If they do something like that now, feel free to post and discuss. As I've tried to explain and I'm sure you've observed, we've allowed plenty of Hong Kong and censorship related discussion in the past days and weeks.
---
It‚Äôs too slow vs aggro and vs control ‚Äòoh, you only had the one?‚Äô
---
Just like all those great joust decks, also a theme of the expansion.
---
Agreed that‚Äôs what was the worst part about them.
---
Go to hsreplay.com they have daily updated lists of the best decks, you can also craft wizbang (he gives you one of 18 deck recipes at random each game).
---
This actually brings up an interesting idea.. if one class is being played more heavily, maybe the quests could skew towards other classes to encourage players to diversify
---
you could zentimo mutate desert hare for the memes though

Why are all the cards in this set pushed so hard? Looks like kobolds and catacombs 2.0 at the moment
---
Do you think the IOC was founded on pay, or was it made up of volunteers who wanted to see their vision in action?
---
I‚Äôm pretty hyped up for dragonbane ain‚Äôt gonna lie
---
&gt;Also, note the double ferocious howl (and crystal power) when I started with Elise + Zephyrs.
---
At the very top lol
---
So Wild &gt; Standard?! ;)
---
Yes, to be more general they confirmed every class is getting a legendary dragon. But as neat as your idea would be, wax isn't a dragon flight. There's enough dragon flights for Blizzard to use that they could've went that route.
---
I wouldn't mind it but I think Odd Warrior might be completely broken against the current field. It would be great to be able to play Janalai and the hero power synergy cards they printed for mage again with some of the new tools they've printed. 
---
Think the wild cards event would've been better if it was one month instead of two as well.
---
No, you bounce it back and evolve again. DUH
---
You didn't answer the question.
---
Exposure bucks it is!
---
Yeah, fair enough...
---
un-downvoted...
---
Agreed. But Genn and Baku wouldn't be the right batch.
---
It would make no sense to give hunters a proto-dragon (proto-drake) as their legendary dragon. They aren't even technically dragons. Brann, however, is riding a red dragon in the trailer, so it seems like the hunter class is still attached to the red dragonflight. As to why the breath is off flavor is probably because the red dragons breathe actual life energy, and healing isn't something hunter does. As you said, Blizzard is consistently inconsistent.
---
edit: I'd expect a twilight dragon to match the old god aesthetic of Lazul.
---
How could you do that? He was such a nice guy. RIP Bob
---
Err, it's not 'boycotting' if the only reason you're not buying it is because you can't afford it. Guess since this is a troll post the logic doesn't matter.
---
r/boblore would love this
---
You deserve it for playing togwaggle Nzoth.
---
Big f for confusing mogu cultist with this card
---
Damn
---
Patience is a virtue
---
I‚Äôm playing a couple of different decks, quest shaman, murloc shaman, but mostly freeze mage. 
---
I guess they might be angry at my choice of deck but some of them have definitely roped on turn one going first, and they play their quest with almost no rope left.
---
Like I said, it hasn‚Äôt stopped me from climbing, it just seems weird. Roping has always been a tactic and it‚Äôs pretty easily dealt with, but I feel like I went from never seeing it to seeing it about 20% of the time now. Maybe it‚Äôs just one of those weird streaks that happen when you play a lot
---
Downvote away but I think Pirate Valeera is sexy
---
How did you find the post after all this time :o
---
Yep, Sniplock right now can make those stats in screenshot without having a layer of Evolve rng. And some can have Rush, Taunt or Charge if you had a Mech previous turn.
---
Trading 80g quest on NA, bunnie#1620
---
Yeah I‚Äôll still copy a deck from HStopdecks or something on the first day if I don‚Äôt see a list I like from a streamer I‚Äôm watching. Deck building isn‚Äôt fun for me, I just wanna play
---
*This will be a mercy killing!*
---
No Patches? But getting that curve really feels nice.
---
Well we dont have the costs of all the cards in the new expansion so we can't really do that
---
The night is darkest before the dawn
---
Still op, maybe adding **Overload:** (2) should fix it.
---
What is fun then?
---
As if it mattered, it's already so broken that I don't want to log in now.
---
2/3 + deal 2+ random secret. What better play can you make with 3 mana?
---
Even hunter couldn't even include secrets and have them be cast from the deck, right?
---
With the next Expansion half of All the cards in Hs will be standard.
---
Contender requires a secret in play, this does not.
---
Sure, you can pick it up from there: https://hsreplay.net/replay/jJxvYGiqbHdzEs9yXLXkLa
---
That game also showcases how strong cards Lazul and DrakonidOP can be.
---
Duplicates in your deck doesn't take your hand or board into account. It doesn't matter if a card in your deck is a duplicate of one in your hand. As long as your deck doesn't include 2 identical cards Reno is activated
---
Am I the only one bothered by the incorrect expansion watermarks?
---
The set is designed months in advanced, but them starting off with 36 cards revealed and them giving the best pre order package they've ever given were probably a response to blizzard coming under extreme scrutiny.
---
Rafaam doesn't seem like someone who'd be interested in that, or would he? After all he never talked about conquering anything he just wants to get revenge on the league maybe?
---
I bought more than hundred packs each expansion, can i get detailed stats about my ranked games instead?
---
echo at (0) cost is the issue.
---
i play a reborn lackey zoolock and pretty aggresively. will this new warlock zoo deck be "aggro" or more like a tempo (still don't know what that means cause im newish)
---
/u/hs_liv yo Liv could you help with this?
---
actually i Think it will. Wheren't they gonna stay until next Rotation?
---
Which I did
---
Huh I didn‚Äôt know that. Well, time to give Blizzard some money for something I enjoy then!
---
Wait, so packs bought with gold count? I was about to drop some real dollars here.
---
Imagine spreading *Limited offer heroes* amongst *Purchasable heroes* and *Reward and special event heroes*.
---
Yes they do, devs have been talking about that and clarifying in interviews throughout the weekend.
---
Maybe the OP wasn't aware as well.
---
\- It's not a competitive game mode.
---
\- The only advantage you can get is very marginal.
---
\- 20 packs is not a lot. Basically just a check whether players actually play HS.
---
\- Are you really upset that a CCG game mode requires people to open packs?
---
All of Shaman is an RNG fiesta.  It‚Äôs biggest power plays - Evolve, Mutate, Lackey generation and MC Tech all rely heavily on RNG.  This is the only thing keeping the deck in check and also the reason why it feels so bad to play against.
---
Meh while Shaman is annoying, I still hate druid more. Not really hate, but it's rather a hate/love
---
Not less than 1 sounds good. I don‚Äôt play wild much but every now and then it breaks a tavern brawl and its tired.
---
It'll be hard to beat valeera tho
---
On mobile so I don‚Äôt know how to link url but if you go to u/mdonais it should be one of his most recent comments.
---
Hello. Thanks for pointing this out.
---
However, as previously indicated by our lack of response, we don't care much.
---
Buy packs for standard instead.
---
Sincerely,
---
Devs.
---
You clearly don‚Äôt value your time highly enough. Time&gt;money friend.
---
Go to r/hearthstonecirclejerk next time. Wrong subreddit. F2P btw
---
lidl do you know hearthstone was already an autobattler :D
---
That's what I meant, sorry
---
You're talking like you never get any packs for free.  You probably get about 10-20 for free from each expansion.  That drastically reduces your 20g per day deficit to the point you will likely complete it just by doing the quests themselves.
---
And I'm pretty sure the average is over 60g if you reroll to max gold anyway, given you will get 100s and 160s thrown in periodically.
---
Void Walker was fine, and sometimes it cheats out a Void Lord - because on Void Walker it was a Deathrattle rather than a Magnetic/Battlecry (takes effect immediately), it was inconsistent, and it doesn't impact the board immediately. Even if Void Lord comes out, you *can* play around it with Silence, Polymorph, Hex, or sometimes Zephrys.
---
With things like Barnes + Resurrect, they were consistent.
---
With Mechwarper + Sn1p-Sn4p/Zilliax, it's often instant lethal. You can't play around this.
---
So, cheating things out at cheap mana cost isn't the problem if done right, but having (nearly) no way to play around it and making it necessary to kill every sticky and non-sticky mech on the board is ridiculous.
---
And if they drew well and has the full Summoning Portal, Coin, Mechwarper, Sn1p-Sn4p x 23, there is literally very few things you can do you can do (Devolve - leaving 7 zoo minions, Plague of Murlocs - leaving 7 synergistic Murlocs, Mass Dispel - leaving 12 attacks, Frost Nova - doesn't clear the board...).
---
They just need to nerf Mechwarper.
---
There is a competitive ladder and after the beta, might be played competitively. 
---
The advantage is 33% better start, that's a decent chunk. 
---
But how easy it is to use gold for 20 packs means it doesn't really matter.
---
Idk the chances for generating 6 random murlocs in 1 turn, but 6 Tinyfins XD
---
Ameno
---
Developers: "We need a creative way for advertisement of our game"
---
Mario has leaderboards; that doesn't make it competitive. The gamemode severely lacks in depth and longevity. Implying it would be actually competitive is laughable. 
---
Your 'math' would imply that the Hero is literally the only factor in winning and losing.
---
No, you can pay with gold too. Also free packs count so it's not that hard
---
Gold works too
---
The devs want you to either:
---
Spend money if you‚Äôre impatient
---
Play a little more than you already play
---
As a casual player who has spent &lt;$10 on the beginner‚Äôs bundle and nothing else since I started playing, I‚Äôm able to get 4K+ gold every expansion, which is way more than enough
---
Along with the occasional free packs and arena tickets (that I usually get an average of 8-9 wins in), 30 packs is honestly nothing much
---
OP sounds like a super casual player who plays once a week or something, just ignore tbh
---
Based on all of the previous expansions- there will be PvE but it will be sold completely separate from the expansion pre-order
---
Deathwing hero?! Am I missing something?
---
You can now &gt;:)

---
Then you won't get them. Blizzard has no motivation to just give away free stuff. Packs and free Legendaries get people playing, but a free hero is just a waste of money for them to give away.
---
Though maybe I'm wrong, bearing Lunara in mind.

The starts align!

Lethal
---
just remember, assumptions make you stupid.
---
Yeah, but Boom wants to get a girlfriend, Hagatha wants to live in a treehouse in the woods, and Togwaggle wants to be king and also filthy rich. Lazul might be an exception considering her connection to "de old gods," but most of EVIL doesn't seem to want Azeroth to just be burned to the ground.
---
Splatoon and CSGO have different audiences I would say. They are both shooters but nintendo and PC players are different audiences/systems. Hearthstone IS competing with auto battler games directly though, as seen by the streamer/player base swing towards them.
---
Remember like 2 years ago when all the Triple A FPS games wanted to compete with Fortnite/PUBG(this case, same audience) so they added Battle Royale modes to their games? It's going to be like. Cool for a week or two, then everyone is going to go back to the one that does it better and has a bigger audience.
---
Hydra time!!!
---
Lmao spot the manlet
---
1.Buy 10 of each expansion one at a time until you open a legendary from each one then start saving gold
---
2.Don't craft anything as the next expansion releases in December.
---
Also did dust your classic cards?
---
If so you have made a huge mistake.
---
7 skins on that list (6 if you take away twitch prime) were earned in game with no money required. They can and did give shit for you know... playing. But got to get that 100 pack preorder money somehow!
---
So stupid too, targeting Boom, but nerfed a shit ton of other classes' barely playable cards into garbage.  RIP getting a backup shudderwok off of one mana discover a battlecry minion.
---
This shows dwarves also admire technology from the opposite faction....
---
Yes clearly. If you preorder the 80$ bundle for the next set, descent of dragons coming December 10th, you get the death wing hero card for warrior, among other things
---
 Konse#2626 EU You know the story: trading 80g quest. I can show you that I have the quest but you go first.

Bruh moment..

I was just saying we could use more variety
---
There's a mini rotation happening next month where 23 impactful cards leave and 140 enter standard.

Wait with crafting (and disenchanting)

What are you talking about? How did you count? . Let‚Äôs break it down and list every character and count Humans, Orcs and Elves, one by one excluding the extra 1k wins versions. Shall we?
---
1. Elise ‚Äì Night elf (counted);
---
2. Lunara ‚Äì Dryad (not counted);
---
3. Malfurion ‚Äì Night elf (counted);
---
4. Alleria ‚Äì High elf (counted);
---
5. Rexxar ‚Äì Ogre /orc (let‚Äôs say not counted);
---
6. Jaina ‚Äì Human (counted);
---
7. Khadgar ‚Äì Human (counted);
---
8. Medivh ‚Äì Human (counted);
---
9. Liadrin ‚Äì Blood elf (counted);
---
10. Arthas ‚Äì Human (counted);
---
11. Sir Annoy-O ‚Äì Unknown, let‚Äôs say a Mech (not counted);
---
12. Uther ‚Äì Human (counted);
---
13. Anduin ‚Äì Human (counted);
---
14. Madame Lazul ‚Äì Facless One / Troll ? (not counted);
---
15. Tyrande ‚Äì Night elf (counted);

6 Humans

3 Orcs
---
So out of 26 heroes we have 16 Humans, Orcs and Elves in total, Sir.
---
What is more, all mages are Humans only.
---
I'll go with DataStonks here, just play Whizbang decks until the rotation and wait for the meta to stabilize, you sould craft the goods cards after that.
---
They usually do a few weeks featuring the expansion's pack after it releases.
---
Is it really that difficult to search for them separately?
---
&gt;There is literally no valid argument against using the Keyword when a minion literally has the exact effect that the keyword is for.
---
There absolutely is. Keywords are about more than just shortening text. They're about highlighting themes and opening up design space. Inspire is neither a theme of this set nor does keywording it open up any design space. Keywording something that isn't going to show up often at all defeats the purpose of a keyword because it adds another layer of information on top of a mechanic rather than creating a shorthand that makes that kind of layered design easier to recognize. This is standard practice in Magic the Gathering where literal decades of experience have shown this is the best way to handle non-evergreen keywords.
---
Why did he need Dalaran to do it? And why the detour into BlackRock, then Uldum?
---
There are reports that it clears with playing/winning a Tavern Brawl. Please check
---
Every expansion focuses on three classes who get extra bonuses. It doesn't mean they are more powerful though
---
and what about people who built their own decks that ran Wild Growth? Some off meta deck that they wanted to make that had a ramp package in it. "any cards commonly associated with it." usually means what the majority of players would have crafted to make the most meta deck that ran the card. So are we saying screw the other people for building their own deck? After the Wild Growth nerf, druid dropped to the bottom for like 2 weeks before Miracle Mecha'thun Druid and eventually Malygos druid became a lot more popular. Those decks still ran a lot of the same cards. because every druid deck then ran like 21 of the same cards
---
Weasel. This is my favorite card by a longshot -- weasel priest, mage, whatever -- it's so f\*\*\*ing funny to fill your opponent's deck with garbage. Also a really cool win condition-- gradually slow your opponent's card draw down so you can take control of the late game.
---
Sorry, what's the card on the far right of the hand?
---
r/SapphoAndHerFriend
---
Wholesome üôèüèº
---
How doesn't it work? 1 kid trick or treats for uniceff, generates 6 dollars. One guy uninstalls hearthstone, doesn't spend 100 dollars. 
---
Does that only not work because it makes you a knobbhead?
---
Definitely stronger than shimmerfly or springpaw.
---
I'll start from the bottom: since Rastakhan's Rumble, we've always receive a balance patch in the first month of the new expansion (Wild Growth Patch, Raiding Party Patch and Luna's Patch). If that's beyond stupid, that I'd like to keep being beyond stupid if that's necessary to have a better game experience.
---
Secondly, Shaman was strong even before the patch, with Mogu + Mutate being a very polarizing play (don't you remember all the post on Reddit showing random Tirions, Fountains or Al'Akirs?). If you look at Vicious Syndicate meta reports, you'll be able to notice that even Murloc builds started running that package because it was so good and so consistent that it was worth the deviation from the deck's theme.
---
To be honest, bringing Mogu to 8 would be enough to mitigate the situation, given that the 9 mana pool is much worse and it would allow Shaman to play it less frequently in the early game. Saying that Shaman doesn't need a change means that you're either blind or, indeed, part of that 35% (or more) of the meta.
---

Greetings
---
So Firebat‚Äôs data on the deck when he was playing it showed a much higher that 60% winrate. So it seems that the deck has some reasonable amount of untapped potential from most people if the data is showing a 58% winrate. Reminds me a little of quest rogue, which was even harder to pilot well and yet still got nerfed more than once despite that the overall data probably still wasn‚Äôt as good as evolve shaman is right now.
---
too bad its like the worst 1000 win portrait
---
Check playrates at your rank, not winrates. That gives you a better indication of what decks you'll face.
---
I wouldn't call the armor guy unfun. It's honestly very good design for an otk deck. You can outright see the progress your opponent is making and directly influence his progress by hitting him. Sure it would suck to lose to some super heavy warrior control/armor gain deck (To be fair control warrior isn't fun to play against, but it would probably feel better losing to this then just getting fatigued), but it's far more interactive then getting killed by some solitaire playing mecathun Druid. 
---
Also for the deathrattle guy. You could just change the text to. Deathrattle: Activate [CardName]'s deathrattle.
---
Also Also the card draw guy should probably be discover not reveal. Makes it a little more consistent and gives it a use for fishing for a specific card.
---
Had the same problem with Sn1p-Sn4p... I was like, but wait didn't we all get that card, no way i dusted it. Was pissed for a good 30 min or so trying to craft a deck.
---
It can easily be fixed by making both tooktip say ‚ÄúCards with Overload limit your mana by X next turn‚Äù
---
In old Warcraft lore the Old Gods were more powerful than the Titans, but that has changed. But in WoW it doesn't matter how powerful a villain is, if it's an end-boss, it's going to be beaten. Archimonde is a great example, unstoppable 1 man army in the lore, he is literally unbeatably by mortals, but got his ass kicked in WoW by Khadgar and leftover soldiers.
---
It's not like Garrosh beats a full-powered Old God into submission with his Gorehowl, but he is able to withstand the corruptive force of the Heart / Sha and use it into his advantage, which is pretty rare, because most characters get corrupted ill or even died by the corruptive power of the Sha.
---
Azshara seems to able to withstand N'Zoth's corruption too. She had the guts to betray him, even tho she is physically mutated into a monster.
---
Armored titan, I see.
---
Well done.
---
It‚Äôs sad that while this would be fairly reasonable for most games, hearthstone is so stingy with rewards that it seems horribly unreasonable
---
Me too, the game freeze frame but I still could play with the mouse, relaunching the game takes longer than before and It wont reconnect not even the reconnect dialogue will pop, relaunching again gives the you lost because of a disconnect, 2 runs lost because of this
---
Sniplock is more common in legend up until then it‚Äôs a somewhat diverse meta.
---
Maybe that'll be the next new dungeon run or whatever, all the E.V.I.L guys going against Rafaam and his dragon.
---
Thats disgusting
---
LIMITED POWER
---
&gt; Just make it so sn1p-sn4p says cant cost less than one
---
i like your other ideas but this is so clunky
---
Yeah, they created the mega bundle. However the goodies like the hero skin and card back will come later, and eventually even later, the actual cards.
---
To be fair, Incels deserve to be insulted.
---
https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/cards
---
I should've said a single meaning?
---
It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúZalgo text,‚Äù if you Google it there are a few text converters that will do it for you. Not sure if that‚Äôs how most folks do it, but it‚Äôs how I do.
---
Largely the same with changes at the top, whichever floats my fancy that day. I run all  face spells since I need quantity to support Vereesa. Rapid Fire, Arcane, Bomb Toss and Kill Command. Spell hunter is low-tier viable in both Highlander and Secret shells, w/ or w/o Malygos. So no fix deck list. 
---
I definitely do not run CotW and Lock &amp; Load, I run Emperor and Vereesa. 
---
For CotW, don't see enough non-Nzoth control, plus you auto-lose to proper control decks anyway as they render both ping damage and secrets ineffective. That's when you switch out for Malygos variants. I play rather secret-midrange style. Only vs Khartuts then do I hold back for burst. 
---
I ping a lot in all variants, which is why I'm very interested in the hunter cards for the next expansion. Hopefully the lack of weapon-hate and the lack of straight-up heals is a deliberate decision for faster games and to create a risk/reward for the heavy power cards (looking at you Oasis and Khartut) 
---
Typical Vereesa on curve games tend to end early. T10-T12 with a 10-15 point burst in the end. Not much, but I'm not holding back early to mid-game as well.
---
I know, I just want the person arguing to say ‚Äúoh I didn‚Äôt see that‚Äù instead of fighting it haha. 
---
But that‚Äôs not how things work.
---
wow breaking news (you're like 2 days late)
---
&gt; Amazing you point to something that actually hurts your argument.
---
I'm not the person you were previously replying to (and I haven't posted any other comments in this thread, either), so I'm not really sure what "argument" you think I'm hurting. The sole purpose of my comment was to criticize the way you went about making your argument.
---
More specifically: when someone criticizes a pro-China corporation, it's disingenuous to criticize them by saying "but you're not boycotting *all* the pro-China corporations, are you?" as though those are the only two options. There is a spectrum of choices. When you act as though there is just an either-or choice, and treat anyone who does not commit to the most extreme end of the spectrum as phony or hypocritical, you're not attacking their arguments themselves‚Äîyou're just making a bad-faith attempt to undermine their legitimacy by holding them to an unreasonably high standard.
---
Of course, if I *was* to make an argument of my own...
---
&gt; Personally I think it's crazy to boycott everything China, because it hurts the wrong people which are the workers over there. They will get fired and forced to find other jobs that don't exist. The rich will move on to do something else or hide their production better so you will continue to buy.
---
...I would actually agree with you, at least in broad terms. I certainly don't think boycotting pro-China corporations is likely to have the desired result in terms of encouraging them not to do business with China.
---
However, I don't think boycotts are completely without merit‚Äîthey're a means of drawing public attention to something, which can lead to the involvement of senators and other government representatives. If the influence that the Chinese regime currently has on US businesses *is* going to be meaningfully reduced, it'll most likely happen at a governmental and legislative level. So I'm not gonna criticize anyone who chooses to boycott a corporation for their pro-China stance‚ÄîI'll just tell them to call or write to their local representative as well.
---
&gt; My goal is to show you that there are other targets that can be boycotted and protested against that are far worse than blizzard. The trouble is that people prefer to protest against entities that they don't use. 
---
This is really just a matter of pragmatism. If your phone or your car is manufactured by a pro-China corporation, it's hard to give up because you may rely on it for your job or other aspects of your day-to-day life. The benefit of a boycott, as we've established, is fairly low, and the cost is high. Hearthstone, on the other hand, is just a game‚Äîunless you have some kind of addiction, you could just give it up tomorrow, and there would be no negative impact on your life whatsoever. The benefit is still low, but this time the cost is low as well.
---
It's no different to (for example) people looking to cut down on their carbon emissions. Ideally, they would like to cease all emissions completely, but in practice they can't, because they depend on those emissions to go to work, to feed themselves, etc. So they act pragmatically, cutting back on extravagances like flying overseas on holiday, while continuing with their essential emissions.
---
(Of course, in both cases, a conscientious person would also search for some kind of long-term alternative to the "necessary evils" that they can't immediately boycott/give up. However, in the short term, I see nothing wrong with pragmatically cutting back on whatever is harmless to cut back on, without shooting yourself in the foot by also cutting back on the things essential for your day-to-day life.)
---
&gt; Everyone is saying that blizzard punished blitzchung because they support China, but they could have also did this because they don't want political speech at their tournaments.
---
On this point, I think you're misinterpreting the reason for the continued outcry. While I'm sure there are a few players who really do believe that any and all political speech should be permitted at tournaments, I think the majority of them do not. If a player had used their post-game interview to yell "Impeach Trump!" and been suspended for it, I doubt we would even be having this conversation.
---
The issue is that Blizzard are an American company with ostensibly American values. From the perspective of an American audience, expressing support for the Hong Kong protestors is *not* political speech. This much is evident from the open letter to Bobby Kotick, which was signed by several different American politicians, irrespective of ideology or party affiliation.
---
Now, to play devil's advocate, you could argue that Blizzard are simply taking an international perspective‚Äîdespite being an American company with ostensibly American values, they do business all over the world, and will ban anything that might be considered political speech in any country where they operate.
---
However, I don't think this is borne out by Blizzard's actions. For example, their products are sold in several countries where topics like homosexuality and gender equality are still controversial‚Äîso a player using their post-game interview to talk about the gender discrimination they've overcome in the past, or how proud they are to be representing the LGBT+ community, ought to be considered political speech. The fact that it isn't lends credence to the idea that Blizzard punished blitzchung and the casters interviewing him specifically for expressing a position critical of China, not because it broke their rules about "political speech".
---
I don't think this is an either-or fallacy because we're talking about an official rule enforced by a central governing body. The thing about rules and laws is, in order to be considered just and fair, they must be enforced evenly on all the people they apply to. I think it's only natural, when such a rule is being enforced selectively, to consider it unjust, and to call into question the true motives of the person enforcing it.
---
lol, go buy some deodorant, take a shower, and go outside you fucking loser
---
Impressive. Are you reposting all the stuff yourself? Or are you using bots? Or account sharing like Gallowfuck?
---
TFT is completely free to play. Those who want little-legend skins or arena skins can buy them. Great model IMO. I've spent hundreds of dollars on Hearthstone over the years but recently quit. I'm not going to buy packs or grind quests, so unless I want to play by with a disadvantage, I won't be playing.
---
There's a reason why N'Zoth hasn't shown up in the meta radar and I think it has little to do with Evolve.
---
By turn 10, your deck should either have won if its aggressive or have a power spike similar to what N'Zoth on turn 10 does. For example: Zuljin, OTK Paladin, or anything Quest Druid does.
---
I don't think N'Zoth is underpowered but I don't think its miles ahead of anyone else either.
---
I'll up vote it
---
&gt;For any aggressive deck, this addition would just make lackeys worse. Maybe for more value styled decks, it seems like a decent addition however, but most slow decks don‚Äôt want to include lackeys anyway.
---
It's bad in existing lackey decks. But why shouldn't control decks use lackeys? Two discover lackeys, taunt, removal... they are not bad in control decks. I tried out a lackey package in control shaman and it worked pretty well.
---
I just want an Elf Warrior, Warlock, and Mage so that way there can be an Elf for every class except Shaman
---
Ok but the key difference is Khartut/N'zoth decks are REALLY easy to stomp down with anything dmg or tempo based. I know because I use it a lot and have seen the weakness. Fast decks beat it, Maly decks beat it, and really just about any decks that doesn't rely on pure late game control value.
---
Hey you're probably right but you gotta go with what your brain gives you and hope for the best sometimes
---
I believe he's making a joke out the "7!" (7 factorial), not commenting on the rarity of the situation.
---
Does the Invoke keyword trigger Galakrond's hero power only *after* you've played him, or do they trigger it even *before* you've played him? I'd assumed the former, but I've seen people assuming the latter, so now I'm wondering if I missed something.
---
this guy gets it
---
What's so different about "Less Mana next turn" and "Limits your Mana next turn," exactly?
---
They're not contradictory.
---
Wait there‚Äôs a new warrior hero?
---
I‚Äôm more excited for this more than I‚Äôve been for the game in a long time. I just hope there are incentives for playing it. Like unlocking new heroes, Bob variations, cosmetics, boards, or whatnot. It doesn‚Äôt need rewards for main Hearthstone but having self-contained reward system or quests would be AMAZING.
---
You don't sound very fun.
---
If you are playing on mobile you can‚Äôt use this deck since the movements are too slow to get enough damage as you could on pc
---
oh yea, this big brain time
---
Whenever.
---
Who uses hakaar?
---
Dude...
---
Each Galakrond?  3 Forms, just like the Spellstones.
---
Made me chuckle.
---
Hehe
---
Dude....
---
Did you miss the whole ‚Äúlet‚Äôs take over Dalaran‚Äù shit?
---
Yeah. I just found out. Deathwing will be the new alternative hero skin for Warrior which is obtainable by pre-ordering the mega bundle. Also, there will be 100 packs in mega bundle instead of 80.
---
Thanks!
---
There's no fucking argument to be made because the biological differences between male and female don't amount to a performance difference in eSports precisely. You not understanding that right away in addition to suggesting that there could be different leagues for males and females only demonstrates that you don't understand the actual sound and legitimate argument to not have trans women compete with men in traditional sports.
---
So even if the argument that trans women shouldn't be allowed to participate in female leagues in traditional sports is sound, you making that argument in this context is fucking retarded and not rooted in logic but, apparently, in an irrational distaste of trans people in general.
---
Sort your shit out, bye.

Drop tentacle and second imp gang, lethal.

Mama Bear is ridiculous so I doubt they would print it unless it cost 10 Mana.
---
The important question here is what is her stance on Hong Kong?
---
I just dont like long card texts, plus echo is always been a problem at 0 cost, like say sorcerers into infinte evolve, sure it wont happen often but its still not a cool way to lose the game
---
Played great games! It was fun to watch this year!
---
You can't really innovate a card game like this much more. This is why they're coming out with Battlegrounds. A new game mode. That's innovation for you.
---
I think the innkeeper did the same, cuz theres no way real Illidan would go down so easily.
---
&gt;Reno will throw off the shackles of the human body and soar into the sky
---
Still a possibility, if Blizzard was trying to tell us something with Jolene Knottley‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpoil The Ending‚Äù Hero power. It wouldn‚Äôt be something so obvious as ‚ÄúReno is crossed out so he dies‚Äù, and that‚Äôs about all I could come up with. Maybe Reno isn‚Äôt aware of his draconic blood and telling him would only make him a more powerful foe? Not sure if unaware dragons are possible in warcraft lore, though.
---
I don't care that much about the gender situation I'm just glad that she did her best and she won!
---
Seriously? 3.3 gold for a 20 or more minutes game? This is crazy.
---
let me say it again, once you know what inspire does, you wont need to read the tooltip again, so the keyword can be used again in the future.

silence baby
---
yikes!
---
Hong Kong is fighting so that they do not have to suffer the same injustices that the people of mainland china do, individual chinese people are victims of the same regime the protesters in Hong Kong oppose.
---
Unless theres reason to believe she has personally advocated for China and the overreach their government is performing,  shes definitely not the enemy here.
---
I think a lot of people feel the same way you do, but also realize the new expansion (and no more Evolve or Nzoth) is right around the corner.
---
The last month of every meta is usually pretty shit (Rise of Shadows being one of the rare one's that wasn't). So, I think we've just grown accustomed to it and quietly accept it.

Did Blizzcon look empty to you?

You figure Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4 wont sell MILLIONS of copies?

You wanna buy a bridge in New York?
---
The videos fine, but the title is a bit bait-y even if you won first place every game you played, we don't know if thats an optimal play yet, there just hasn't been enough of it played yet, sorta like how early streamer decks dominate but by the end suck of have like 8 cards changed out usually, its just impossible to know rn
---
I think this is because girls dont like play Games?

This is such a broad topic, though I mean, what do you want the reality to be? **For there to be completely zero toxicity towards women in gaming? ** You know you can't have that for the simplest of reason that every single human being has their own opinion, can and will voice it, so **there‚Äôs always going to be people for and against something.**
---
It you are for toxicity towards women, then you are a huge pack of decayed rot. And no one wants that around.

Ah damn that's far. At least we got a bunch already.
---
A Cirlejerk inside a Cirlejerk god damn this is crazy
---
Yep, I'm aware, but I'm trying not to attack people for their opinions anymore regardless of what those opinions are. Bigots and transphobic people exist because they don't know any better and shaming them for the way they think tends to only perpetuate those thoughts.

Good way of putting it. Used to have a lot of faith in Iskar too. Now I think he's barricaded himself in so deep and hiding behind win/loss stats that he is refusing to hear anything else. The shit just isn't fun to play against when there is no counterplay if they have two specific cards in hand.
---
He outright betrays Tekhan by saying "I got what I needed from Uldum, I'm leaving, fuck all y'all," not that he looted the whole place dry and wants more, he clearly had an objective that he completed there. Presumably, the same can be said for Dalaran. Blackrock Mountain was for the fun of it, or something.

Reddit: ask a question, start a war

Ok, boomer

Lol. Out of all the different ways people mishear this card, this is exactly what I hear too.
---
It‚Äôs The Rock. /s
---
Suddently China not so bad eh?
---
It's a slow card and should add some fun to Quest Druid.  It's not bad in Quest Shaman if it were 8 Mana and they could double the battlecry.

Whooosh
