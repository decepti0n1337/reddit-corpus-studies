It's an interesting deck, and i've given it a shot.  It's fun for the surprise factor, though it feels like a deck from a previous year in a sense.  Just a bit slower than fast decks, and not quite as much value as current decks.  Though that may in part be due to my bone drakes giving me little dragons quite often.  Hard to say since I haven't played nearly as many games.  It's fun, it just doesn't feel like it does anything that unfair enough to be a t1/2 kind of deck.

---
---
I addressed this in your other comment, but I think this is a non-issue or even an *advantage* for Hearthstone over Magic.
---
Thanks for linking these two, I hadn't read them before (but I'd seen the original). Now I'm trying to find an article about One with Nothing I remember reading a while back...
---
A 30/1 rager would be an auto include in any aggro deck. At some point, an X/1 for 3 would be playable. The question is just when

You shouldn‚Äôt disenchant anything, since you never know if you might need it again later.

At least Hearthstone doesn't have this useless pile of shit

It's not assuming that at all, that's the entire point of "flip a coin and maybe win." If anything you seem to be assuming that your opponent is 100% guaranteed to have an answer which is obviously not always going to be true. Your opponent doesn't automatically win board control on turn 2 or draw a ping on turn 3.

If you only care about arena, you wouldn't have spent your gold on a pack anyway, and would be playing arena whether you average 2 or 10 wins. At that point going infinite is just about how sustainable playing your preferred game mode is and how much it needs to be supported by grinding out games in constructed. 
---

---
Perhaps you and the other guy are arena only players, and so we're coming at this from different perspectives. I enjoy both game modes, and see them as supporting each other. You can play arena regardless of what your collection looks likes, it gives you a break from the same decks you see on the ladder, and rewards you in part with packs and dust to expand your collection. You can then take that expanded collection and build the decks you want in constructed, where it can be easier to grind out gold from quests and every 3 wins, which you use to buy arena runs.
---
I don‚Äôt have any elixer tho, I have like 4
---
What if you are playing a control deck?
---
Sure if they like gambling on the chance there opponent won‚Äôt play any minions to trade it out, basically a 1/1 making it useless
---
Wait
---
Plus now each game lasts considerably longer than vanilla Hearthstone if you've got a good opponent.
---
Just FYI I‚Äôm u/octobroo
---
I know I have slowed my spending considerably over the years as it looks more futile now to try and keep up. They would actually get more money from me if they made it easier to keep up a collection. Losing adventures was huge.
---
So this kind of feedback isn‚Äôt useless to them. 
---
Now, when players get mad at Blizzard for being ‚Äúgreedy‚Äù, I can‚Äôt take that seriously because they are a for-profit company.
---
you can expand it beyond CCG's, it's the same with any startup.  They need to get a quick grab at users, and will run at a loss and burn through investor money in order to do so.  Moviepass has become my quintessential example for this (technically not a startup as it was around for awhile, but a new option to get users in).  Did everything everyone wanted, and completely crashed and burned cause they couldn't make money and ran out of investors dollars.
---
I would love to play hearthstone again, just too pricey, cant even make fun decks anymore. Havent opened it in over a year 
---
I think it does. What the game really needs is a new mill archetype, especially with Togwaggle rotating out. A solid mill deck would discourage the use of OTK combos and encourage more value play, which is where I think Hearthstone is at its best.
---
For what it's worth, I reconsidered my original comment; I think the key to a good control deck is establishing inevitability, in whatever form that takes. Control-combo decks or others with a big finish fill that role pretty well in the current meta. That may change if we see a new mill archetype, as it would become the new standard for control.
---
The very infrequent arena player in me wants them to make it 5 gold per win. 50% increase and I'm not stuck with an unusable 5 gold until I feel like playing arena again.
---
This is kinda exactly what I mean. It takes a very specific hypothetical new card to enable, yet hard to come up with actual specifics like card text, and in the end still like a three or four card combo to do something like Inkmaster Solia, which wasn't an incredibly strong card itself. I'd be pretty surprised if Duskfallen is ever playable.

Divine Favor has seen play and it‚Äôs a dead card verse aggro. You are ‚Äúgambling‚Äù on your opponent being control. 
---
Keleseth sees play even though you are ‚Äúgambling‚Äù on drawing it early.
---
Not all decks are minion heavy. And even the ones that are might not be able to answer this card. Even worse if you‚Äôre playing Paladin and have righteous protector(s) up.
---
Well are we hypothetically speaking or not? It wouldn‚Äôt be a 30/1 realistically and they wouldnt have an answer 100% of the time but what about a top deck on this thing? When your opponent has a board? The thing is trash! One health minions are trash unless they are one drops or have rush/charge
---
&gt;Im just wondering is casual just filled with bots?
---
I've been hearing a lot about bots in Casual lately, but I don't know if any of that has been verified. In general, I find there isn't much reason to play Casual after all the changes they've made to Ranked over the last year.
---
&gt;how many decks do you have that you think are good enough. i assume people who have been playing for a long time have multiple good decks. but how long will it take someone who started playing in late December to get a decent 2nd deck for ranked when i get bored of mechathun
---
This depends on a number of factors like how often you play, whether or not you stay on top of your quests, how you manage your resources, what you craft, etc.
---
For example, if you're content playing more aggressive decks, you can easily have multiple competitive yet budget friendly decks like Midrange Hunter and Zoolock for very little investment. As far as meta decks are concerned, there are always more affordable decks available. You might want to stick to a budget deck for now, though, since the next set is bound to release around April and Standard will rotate taking the three oldest sets with it.
---
The problem is that topsy+ inner fire breaks this pretty hard. A priest could play this + topsy on 3 and be able to threaten lethal the next turn pretty consistently. At 15 it would still be a threat because of divine spirit.
---
Before that I would have been fine with 15/1 since if you cannot deal with that on turn 3-4 your deck is just too greedy/slow and deserves to be punished, but with topsy existing this side of design might just be too dangerous.
---
A general outline of what I'd like to see.
---
**Standard games:**
---
- 5 gold/win
---
- 10 gold for first win of the week.
---
- 15 gold for first win of the week with a given class. (stacks with above.)
---
- 20 gold for playing 20 games in the week (win or loss)
---
**Arena:**
---
- Current rate.
---
- a "cumulative winning streak" bonus, where each consecutive win increases the pot by 2*the current win rate. For example:
---
 - 1 win - 2 gold.
---
 - 2 wins - 2+4=6 gold.
---
 - 3 wins - 2+4+6=12 gold.
---
 - 4 wins - 2+4+6+8=20 gold.
---
 - etc. to a limit of 200 gold in a given arena run. (limit might be generous)
---
**Monthly prize chests:**
---
- Rank 45-40:
---
 - Current prize
---
 - 1 common deck
---
- Rank 40-35:
---
 - 1 (prior to latest expansion) deck
---
- Rank 35-30:
---
 - 1 (latest expansion) deck
---
- Rank 30-20:
---
- Rank 20-10: 
---
- Rank 10+: 
---
I understand that this won't actually happen, but I'd like to see something like that. A flat gold/win rate that is slightly more generous than the current helps to encourage more game-play. The first win w/class is to try to encourage players to, ya know, play other classes. Pumping up the monthly prizes helps encourage people to compete. And arena offers more opportunity for a meaningful win-streak mechanic.
---
Consistently inconsistent when writing the buffs
---
I get that they give you a lot to start with, but that's a completely separate issue from what we were talking about.
---
[[Ultimate infestation]], [[The Caverns Below]] omegalul
---
Right, but draft formats in magic have exponentially better rewards, plus you get to keep what you draft.
---
Imagine in HS if you could pay 750 gold for arena run and if you did great you would earn several packs instead, AND on top of that kept your drafted cards lol. That would be bonkers for HS, it's normal in magic.
---
You actually have a choice to draft things to keep rather than having to pick certain cards whether you wanted to play them or not just in hopes of being competitive enough to not get hosed for the time spent.
---
Go ahead, see if anyone replies
---
Ridiculous that there's even a limit these days. They're hoping games like Eternal which just shower you with packs remain unknown to HS's loyal whales
---
Hearthstone in general is outdated and needs to adjust to the new world. 
---
I'm a whale and I can't even play all the top decks. 
---
It‚Äòs worse if you take a closer look on your point. If we just go ahead and say we get ~50 Gold every day from the quest, then you still need 50 Gold to buy a pack.. so you need 15 Wins or if we agree on a ~50% WR, 30 Games a day to get the other 50 Gold from Wins. That means you can buy 30 Packs every month, provided you play   3-4+ Hours a day.  
---
If you got bad packluck and rely on the 40 Pack for a Legendary-Trigger, you get 3 Legendaries in 120 Days or 4 Months... you see where I‚Äòm going here?  
---
Ofc we can talk better luck in pack opening. I dont want to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but from my experiences after playing HS for 3+ years, you have better chances getting good stuff from paid packs than earned for free ones.  
---
Yes, Hearthstone is free to play and Blizzard needs to somehow make money off the game, but imo they are milking us. I spent ~150‚Ç¨ since the new expansion and I can only play 2-3 Classes competitively.
---
Bring out your dead.
---
One of my favorite cards. It easily trades for 2-3 minions if your opponent is too squeamish to remove it with a spell, and they never want to leave it up because *gottausespells*.
---
Yup, as I've said in other threads, Niantic, although not perfect, they know how to keep their player base by giving a lot of incentives if you play daily. And it makes me think. 
---
"Huh, they've given me a lot of nice stuff, I could support them by buying some coins" although I haven't done that because I'm a cheap bastard.
---
But yeah, they could implement new things
---
Nobody is going to feel bad for you if you're using deathstalker rexxar.
---
I still play both but I pretty much only log on to HS for quests and events. Mtga has a much more fulfilling daily reward system (plus being a better game but that's subjective).You get a reward for each win up to fifteen per day. Some gold, some cards. Plus a daily quest system similar to HS. It's not that the total gold rewards per day is any greater than Hearthstone's, in fact they are probably pretty close. It's that the first fifteen wins each day give a reward which is a better incentive to play "just one more" to get that next reward.
---
I never actually realized that. Good catch TC. Though I don't see the flavor text being changed any time soon..
---
[[Zilliax]] Good strong neutral card that isn't op. Usable in both standard and arena. Gives healing to classes that need it, and generally not an "oh I'm dead now" card for your opponent when you play it.
---
Thats not all he was saying clearly, 
---

---
5/3/2 Mech | Magnetic Divine Shield, Taunt, Lifesteal, Rush  
---
Yeah, that's why rush is a good mechanic, charge on that thing would have been broken...
---
My problem is that I feel like I can only refine one deck per expansion unless I netdeck.  If I make my own deck, maybe there's a couple epics I want to try out and see if they work.  800 dust.  Maybe there's a legendary that some people run and some people don't.  1600 dust.  
---
The process of refining a deck can cost as much as a whole new deck, and if I can only make ~3 decks per expansion, that means I can either make 3 different decks that are good, or 1-2 decks that are my own, and are of dubious quality.
---
Specialization into a limited number of classes per year helps.  I started the year with a few Hunter decks because I played Spell Hunter in KNC, then I crafted the Druid core for Taunt Druid.  But when I tried to get into Paladin in Boomsday, it wiped out most of my dust stores.  Tried to get into Rogue in RKR, again, that took most of my dust.  Meanwhile I made one new Hunter deck in RKR that took zero dust, because I happened to open the one new Legendary I needed for it (Oondasta).  But I wanted to branch out, and it cost me.
---
Yeah you‚Äôd think, but that‚Äôs not how it works. Stat changes and death rattles are the only buffs, if I‚Äôm not mistaken.
---
&gt; **You don't pay for power in hearthstone. You pay for variety.** 
---
This is false. I spent tons of dust crafting these cards in Even Shaman deck: Al' Akir, Hagatha, Kalimos, Greymane, Lich King, 2x Corpsetaker, 1x Sea Giant
---
I even crafted Aya to play wild.
---
Then Flametongue nerf make the deck highly unusable.
---
There's a difference between referring to decks as legend-viable in terms of an individual and in terms of the meta. Players like Dekkster come up with cool stuff and do really well with them because they're really good players. I see Kibler doing well with off-meta stuff too, but I wouldn't call those decks "legend-viable" because it ignores the context of how they're played. There are budget versions of meta decks that a beginner can build in their first week that are legend-viable if that's how you're applying the term.
---
If those are the kinds of decks you want to build, that's cool, but it doesn't seem reasonable to expect to be able to build those decks for free or cheap.
---
&gt;Someone had to come up with Cubelock, it wasn't meta on day 1 of Kobolds.
---
Vicious Syndicate has "Cube Control Warlock" in their first full Kobolds &amp; Catacombs meta report. I'm sure hundreds, if not thousands, of players were testing out what would become Cubelock on day one.
---
&gt;Also, did I mention that deckbuilding is a fundamental part of card games?
---
Obviously. That doesn't mean it has to be the focus or the most fun part. My point was that in a digital card game where a kitchen table environment isn't really possible, deck building loses a lot of its broad appeal because of the way metas naturally form so quickly and that it's unreasonable to expect such a game to cater toward that.
---
October 2016, the murloc patch.
---
10 gold for 3 wins *is* outdated
---
when they came up with the formula there were no free packs from quests, no tavern brawl and no 80 from battling friends
---
just from playing the game casually and doing daily quests you get plenty of gold, while it's true that you can't make every single deck for free, you can certainly make a lot of decks.
---
Lmao pause at 0:43 and look at that anyfin deck.
---
lol I remember dom release weekend everybody thought this hideous card was good.
---
Go to sleep then come back and read your comments. Geez, man...
---
Right. A card like that naturally wants other valuable cards to take advantage of its effect. But if you're nowhere close to having the cards that would make it work, holding onto Boomship won't give you any value until you do have those cards. When you consider how long it would take or how much dust you'd have to invest to acquire those cards, it's not likely worth it.
---
I would prioritize crafting practical decks, especially those that have staple cards that either work in a wide variety of decks or that are bound to be useful for a long time.
---
I‚Äôm really really done with the reskinned dungeon run being the new single player, it was really cool once but I miss Karazan :(
---
Still, there's no reason should have to choose just one class, especially if you pay.
---
Agreed. Between quests and ladder, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to earn 2 packs every three days. That‚Äôs very easy to do. And for somewhat ambitious players, it‚Äôs not a stretch to average a pack a day. Let‚Äôs not forget Arena.
---
You must not have been around when even Paladin was dominating the meta, pre-call to arms nerf. It shut out every single deck except pre-nerf cubelock, which was also oppressive. 
---
What, dusting system is specifically to help an issue magic does not have. It's meant to trick people into thinking exactly like you do lol. 
---
At least I can grow my collection by destroying my collection at an obscene exchange rate...
---
You can certainly recognize the irony in that can't you? 
---
I spent an embarrassingly long time trying to figure out how you managed to buff Hireek when the answer is literally still on board.
---
I‚Äôm probably going to make a post about the actual priest deck in the near future. This is Kibler‚Äôs  quest priest with princess Talanji and it has been some of the most fun hearthstone I have ever played. Additionally, I have hit the turn limit multiple times this week (due to priest mirror and seance) which is always hilarious 
---
I love wild because I like to use all my hard earned cards!
---
Thanks again boss
---
So you believe yourself when you say tripling the amount of gold earned wouldn't make people buy less packs?
---
Being a neutral would be huge for [[steward of darkshire]] though, it'd at very least be considered in wild at 2 mana.
---

3/3/3 | Whenever you summon a 1-Health minion, give it Divine Shield.  
---
Again, you dismiss serious draw backs of playing suboptimal replacements. You lower your win rate by having it, affecting your win rates in many scenarios. With lands, you give up way more with your free options, as it adds a layer of clunkiness to every turn you play with them.
---
"The fact remains that for almost every key card in magic there is a sub optimal replacement" it's just a complete lie, especially when you consider just standard sets. There's no viable replacement for a tefery or any planeswalker, a nexus of fate or their generally unique effect mythic cards. When you get to specific cards in either game, there will be replaceable cards and there won't be. 
---
Obviously it's worse to miss 6 priest cards vs 6 MTG cards, you're comparing 1/5th of a deck vs 1/10th. Your absolute lack of thought into your arguments is obvious. "There is no way to even come close to arguing my statement. " Which explains close minded statements like this one, it's easy to dismiss any argument if you refuse to attend any mental capacity to consider it. 
---
Rag is literally right there
---
They're saying, on average (at least within expansions), if you played a 3 drop, and I played a 4 drop, the 4 drop will be stronger. That's just the nature of cards with mana costs. 
---
So yes, when you say the 4 cost mech rager is better than the 3 cost magma rager, on average, that will be true. 
---
A 31/1 is the highest you'd need to define the meta (the one extra attack to play around druid hp), everyone would play mage with 2 of them. I guess paladin could also be a possibility, since you couldn't ping the dude and play the rager, but it'd still only take one misstep for them to drop it into an empty board and possibly win. Rogue is interesting with the 4/4 that gives stealth, but there's that pesky problem of probably being dead to the mages.

Never play marine fox vs a priest unless u see him play his 2 inner fire cards

From the discolouration of the Shrine's armour pieces, I suspect it's actually Gonk's used armour pieces the team uses.

Very creative!

Every eternal format in every game is equally as "unhealthy" as Hearthstone's Wild format. Have you ever looked into them?
---
&gt;Count his subs, that‚Äôs $2 a month each.
---
FYI, bigger channels have room to leverage, and usually make more than the usual advertised cut. I forgot the exact amount but I think it's around a 70-80% cut.
---
Saying that other games are just as bad is not a valid reason to not fix problems with your game.
---
I think the issue here is that Blizzard doesn't like explaining things. I think if they explained what an enchantment IS then it would probably come out that divine shields don't count as enchantments, they're a separate object that goes "in front of" the minion.
---
There are LOTS of inconsistencies in behavior between cards that are worded exactly alike. It's kind of annoying but no one really cares because experienced players get an advantage from it and so they like it.
---
Off topic, I guess, but I have seen some YouTube videos that show the Mana cost of the opponent's cards. Is that some kind of add-on? Is that "legal"?
---
deckbuilding in mtg is also a LOT more varied. a pool of 300 cards can make 8 decks, all significantly unique. the same is not really true of hearthstone - most classes only have 3-4 unique decks at any given time
---
Hearthstone should really just change their purchase system. 
---
Spending $50 to open a bunch of packs is actually pretty unsatisfying. 
---
They should change it so you pay $50 to get a season pass that doesn't include any packs but your gold payout is significantly improved and your quests have better returns. The scaling should be that if a person plays 1 hour a day, by the end of 4 months they have almost all the legendarys. 
---
This structure will promote better playing because won't just open all their cards at once and be done with an expansion. But you can slowly unlock decks pieces by pieces on a more casual scale and build up. 
---
The biggest thing hearthstone needs to do is give people a reason to play. Currently everything gets stale quick and we should be giving more in game rewards.
---
Do you really think you would be happier with an extra 100g/day?
---
If arena gave me better options dont you think i d had taken them?

Get over your sense of entitlement. I am a pure f2p player, been playing for 2.5 years and I‚Äôve hit legend twice, hit rank 5+ every month for two years, own several meta decks and have enough resources to craft five more if I feel like it. This game is more than generous. 
---
You reminded me of drafting Amonkhet and taking a masterpiece Consecrated Sphinx as my first pick even though I wouldn't use it in the event. I sold it for $120 a week later. The draft cost me $20.

Noob quesion but what cards were in Midrange Shaman?
---
Magic Arena is only more generous because to be in order to compete with Hearthstone. If it wasn't, no one would play it over Hearthstone or paper Magic, and if it ever supplants Hearthstone as THE digital CCG, expect Hearthstone to suddenly get cheaper and Magic arena to steadily get more expensive.
---
Im amazed people still play that game. I like to play it but the grind is too much. It sucks the fun out for me. So i just watch kripp or trump and enjoy not spending time or money one the game.
---
You're only being downvoted because it's the HS sub. The dwindling player numbers/streamers in HS and insane popularity of Magic Arena makes it blatantly obvious to anyone who isn't heavily invested into hs. 
---
None would see play, as long as Mage and/or Hero Powers exist.
---
What are these legendaries and epics in magic yoy speak of?
---
It really is a shame, several months ago I stopped playing on mobile and then uninstalled. The unending several giga worth of updates few times a week were too much for me.
---
What are wildcards for 500
---
You‚Äôre probably thinking of the addons that show the turn the card was drawn. Some of them have the turn number shown in mana crystals, which could be where the confusion comes from. There are currently no ways to view such specific information about your opponents draws.

---
Yeah, that's a huge investment. I'm ptw and had the dust to do it yet I still didn't craft Kalimos for the deck and just played without it.
---
I cannot compute what the chances of that are.... 
---
Sorry but not, stay with your f2p account. Blizzard (like any other company) wants money, they are not gonna give you a easier/cheaper way to collect all cards.
---
Troll gladiator is cool looking.
---
The monthly rewards are a joke too. No gold and 5 dust if you get to level 5?! What the hell is 5 dust other than an insult. Yes you get a golden epic and two golden commons which i always dust but still for a month of playing thats 505 dust for reaching level 5 which is super cheap. Oh but what if you grinded your way to level 4, 3, or 2? Well Just add 5 more dust per level! Lol. At legend have an extra golden common which is a net gain of 25 dust! Its just ridiculous
---
That's for the week. You get a pack at 5, 10, and 15 wins and this resets ok Sunday (pretty sure it's Sunday but you get the idea). Daily wins give gold starting at 250 (which is 1/4 a pack for others new to MTGA) and wins afterwards give decreasing amount of gold (100-50-25). You also get random cards which is pretty nice.
---
Wild cannot be "fixed" in the way you seem to want it to be without it being completely neutered in the process.
---
Standard is where someone should have the relative expectation for "fair and interactive" gameplay, which is normally is. Wild just has too many legal cards for "uninteractive" decks to simply not exist.
---
That's *weekly* and it caps at 15 wins.
---
Daily wins gives gold with diminishing returns and individual cards.
---
Jesus Christ this was a waste of time and effort.
---
It's 2019 and there still are people criticizing this game's economy.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Helloooo, wake uuup?! Blizzard doesn't give a shit and won't ever do as long as there are people throwing their money at their faces.
---
This game (actually not this game but the entire Activision/Blizzard) needs the exact same reaction that people have shown to EA's Battlefront 2.
---
I think \[\[Shadowflame\]\] and \[\[Charge\]\] might be more relevant
---
It's probably just habit on your part but as a 10 year mtg player, seeing someone call rares and mythic rares "epics" and "legendaries" makes my eye twitch. 
---
Honestly, I can see your grievances with the system in mtga. It's not perfect and obviously designed to entice players to spend at least SOME money, but what free to play card games aren't?
---
For me at least, the fact that wild cards exist and are not as much of a pain in the ass to acquire as dust seals the deal for me. Yeah I can win 30 HS games (assuming no dailies) for a pack, but most packs give a mediocre rare and absolutely garbage commons which net you fuck-all dust to begin with, and you don't want to disenchant epics or legendaries for a quarter of their value to craft other shit. I'd rather win 5 games in mtga, get a fair bit of gold and a pack, and probably a wild card as well as some useable commons and maybe a good uncommon, rare or mythic. It just feels better for me.

 Loefster#1288 NA 80g quest trade 
---
I think they should keep the gold/win as an incentive to play constructed formats. If they decided to reward 5/win instead of 10/3 wins it can encourage players to play more constructed while keeping the overall gold acquisition very similar to the current system.
---
Moreover, an achievement system which rewards players with gold, cards or packs would encourage more players to try out different things. As people have mentioned several times some cards are unplayable and there is no incentive to actually play but if there were achievements which can be easily acquired using said cards, it would make weaker meta cards a lot more useful rather then feeling like dead weight in the collection. An example for the above mentioned scenario would be to win 30 games with a deck that has 20+ deathrattle minions and/or cards with deathrattle in their text box (This would make cards like Play Dead usable and allow these decks to have a basis rather then look like an Arena deck in a constructed environment).
---
Hopefully, we get some feedback if there are any plans for the gold generation model which currently is rather lacking. Obviously as long as Hearthstone racks millions every month, these changes won't be even considered especially when there are other QOL issues that should be tackled.
---
shhhhhh
---
Fake, ask you to do a survey and download "an official app" which is most likely a virus.

Well, this must be a more recent manifestation of the scam, because I took the screenshot this morning. We need to imperatively and systematically shut down this kind of fraudulent activity which exists as a kind of moral stain on the community‚Äôs breast plate.

&gt; This isn't a rebuttle to anything I said?
---
Just because it was a deck definer in Quest Rogue doesn't mean it wasn't ridiculously good in other decks.
---
&gt; You kinda have to provide a reason for this.
---
The reason is self-explanatory. The more a card sees play, the better it is. There's a pretty clear correlation. Not a perfect one, obviously, but a pretty clear one.
---
&gt; Plenty of cards show up in just as many decks as Zilliax does and you're not complaining about them.
---
No, they really don't. Zilliax is one of the most ubiquitous cards in the meta, as it stands.
---
&gt; So are Stonehill and Firefly?
---
No, they're not. As I already explained.
---
&gt; This is comletely 100% irrelevant. Zilliax is the same.
---
No, it is the exact opposite. Zilliax sees play for the exact same reasons between every single deck.
---
Evidently you're not even listening at this point. 
---
Why don't *you* give me a reason to read more of what you have to say if it's just going to be ignorant.
---
This deck is boring as hell, but I‚Äôm more upset that the meta is so slow that it‚Äôs actually viable. I NEVER thought I‚Äôd be happy to see a zoolock, but I‚Äôm actually thankful when I see a smorc deck now, means I won‚Äôt sit through a half hour of bullshit until priest gets a minion to stick.

\&gt;Failing to answer the question \[...\] Just because it technically counts as censorship doesn't explain why this censorship -KingLordNonk

Failed, like when you got caught lying and contradicting yourself and pretend the image wasn't censored or doesn't count. When people presented screenshot proof, or dictionary definitions that debunk your mental gymnastics you threw a tantrum. You didn't want to hear the answer or facts.
---
Maybe the fail when you tried to prove the others you didn't bully others, cuss, or break the rules. By bullying others, cussing, and breaking the rules. Way to be delusional and contradict yourself.

---
Delusional. The lack self awareness and mental gymnastics is astonishing.The irony is maybe you should take your own advice and read what you said or rules. If you hate people answering and debunking your point, then stop asking for it. You are instigating trouble. You said weren't interested in facts, proof, or definitions and went as far as to attack people's gender. Going broken record, insults,  contradicting yourself or throwing a string of random off topic question isn't going to save you face. 
---
Now you desperately stalk others and demand to discuss people's history outside this post as well. This isn't remotely related on OP proving the naysayers Jaina Proudmoore did get nerfed with proof of a screenshot. Good luck with that. 
---
But the wildcard turnaround on packs is WAY greater than the dust-&gt;epic/legend of your choice. You also get more packs per week, possible wild cards out of the packs, and as of recently the gem/vault fixes. Yes you can run 2-4x as many cards, but its usually not required, and many of the rares/mythics you dont want TOO many of unless its the core premise of your deck.
---
Shadowverse supposedly (and from the limited time I played) has a significantly better F2P reward turnaround as well. Gwent was also better. Hearthstone has gotten away with one of the worst reward systems, but only because they have been the big dog in the digital card game market.
---
They are losing quite a few streamers to games like auto chess and MTG:A, and while streamers don't really care about F2P as whales, it just shows a decline in popularity due largely in part to stale meta, lack of interesting game modes, and other problems. They need to do something to turn the game around soon.
---
I think you don't understand the time scale make more pages probably won't take that long us they have done it before
---
You are making a really really bad point by bringing up Duskfallen Aviana.
---
She is exactly the card they should do more of. Weird and powerful effect that might make some amazing deck, or not.
---
The whole point of these cards is to give powerful effects for the deck makers to play around with. If blizzard just makes every powerful card with the intention of it being used in a very specific planned out deck, then all the many possibilities goes away. 
---
Aviana could easily have been a stable in a OTK deck under the right circumstances. Imagine the OTK deck requires 2-4 card setup because of 10 cost card having to be heavily cost reduced to be played together with the other OTK combo cards(like mecha'thun). With Aviana that could go down to just 2 cards.
---
If the meta  had 2 or3 tier 1 decks with little to no hard removal and very low curve, Aviana would be a game changer. Drop Aviana, they play a free 5 mana minion and some other 5 mana minion(if they have perfect hand) but that still leaves Aviana on board.
---
You play your 10 mana minion for free and win the game on turn 6 rather than turn 13-18 like these OTK usually do. 
---
Imagine the power of a card giving your win condition 10 turns ahead. 
---
Everyone knows that lol
---
It would go right after you all ready unlock decks by betting the heroes so I don't think it would be that confusing
---
Gimme Gimme 
---
What bothers me even more is that the general community seems to want the rewards without putting  the work behind it. People who play meta decks and aspire to improve their winrate should be rewards a lot more then people who don't care about the ranking system and instead want to play gimmick decks on ladder.
---
Instead the general community wants to rack all the rewards without much effort and blame it on the fact that it requires 100s of dollars to obtain all the cards in the set.
---
While I agree that players should be encouraged to play different styles and explore the meta game through-out, at the end you'll need to pay whether it's with time or money. Unless Hearthstone players or even collectible card game players in general don't understand this philosophy they will always remain dissapointed because whether they accept it or not this is the comfort model that CCGs tend to lean on (Look at Magic Arena).
---
Because it was pretentious and didn‚Äôt really elaborate. My point was that they had incredible attention to detail, depth, and game-feel. You‚Äôd almost always be able to tell you were playing a Blizzard game due to how it felt to play. Polish upon polish upon polish. 
---
Warcraft (both Warcraft and WoW), Starcraft and Diablo were all genre-defining. Overwatch made quite the splash, too. At the height of WoW‚Äôs popularity, there literally couldn‚Äôt exist a western MMO because of how ruthlessly WoW outdid them. 
---
The problem that many fans have with ‚Äòmodern‚Äô Blizzard is that it feels like they‚Äôve completely dropped the ball on what made them so appealing. Recent WoW expansions have felt shallow and rushed. We haven‚Äôt had a Warcraft since WC3, StarCraft is dead. Blizzard *owned* the RTS market and just let it go. 
---
The most concrete example I can think of is Diablo versus Path of Exile. D3 had such a strong start. But monumentally stupid decisions let it get outcompeted gradually and *hard*. There‚Äôs no reason, except corporate risk aversion, that they couldn‚Äôt have changed monetization and competed, instead of just rolling over and let a company that actually gives a fuck about their product crush them. 
---
It surprised me how people have taken this long to actually finish Dungeon Run. What classes held you back and what strategies did you try to overcome the challenges?
---
&gt; Just because it was a deck definer in Quest Rogue doesn't mean it wasn't ridiculously good in other decks.
---
I never claimed this. Which is why I told you what you said wasn't a rebuttle to anything I said. 
---
&gt; The reason is self-explanatory. The more a card sees play, the better it is. There's a pretty clear correlation. Not a perfect one, obviously, but a pretty clear one.
---
I've already told you what exactly Zilliax needs to be considered oppressive, and showing up in a lot of decks isn't it. Please provide proper evidence, thanks. 
---
&gt; No, they really don't. Zilliax is one of the most ubiquitous cards in the meta, as it stands. It is ranked #1 of most popular Neutral cards, with just under a 10% lead over Fire Fly.
---
In the current meta, sure. Zilliax has been out for half a year already. Plenty of cards have shown just as much prominence at other times, even before it was released. 
---
&gt; No, they're not. As I already explained.
---
You didn't explain anything about that, straight up. You're just making lots of statements, without any evidence. 
---
&gt; No, it is the exact opposite. Zilliax sees play for the exact same reasons between every single deck.
---
Aaaaaaand that's a bad thing because....? 
---
&gt; Evidently you're not even listening at this point.
---
That's kinda my line here dude. You want to know why? 
---
&gt; Why don't you give me a reason to read more of what you have to say if it's just going to be ignorant.
---
Because I already did this. In the post you just responded to and downvoted. You haven't yet. You've provided one, *single* reason for why you believe Zilliax is an oppressive card. I've told you that reason is incorrect, provided evidence to support my statement, and told you what Zilliax would need to be to be considered oppressive. 
---
Convince me, or swallow your pride and admit you were wrong. No shame in that. 
---
But if we have more deck slots we try new stuff and cards there for makeing us want new cards there for more people buy packs. You hear that blizz money come and get it
---
How is Hakkar a combo enabler? The negative downside is active for both players, and if you play smart, you can even disable it.
---
Also they need to change the cost of epic cards. There are very fun epic cards but we cant try them at all due to their costs. This makes the game very monotonic.
---
&gt; You've provided one, single reason for why you believe Zilliax is an oppressive card. 
---
I literally said in my first comment:
---
&gt; I like Zilliax, **I'm not going to say it's oppressive,** but Neutral cards that are just good to find themselves in a variety of decks is what made people hate Piloted Shredder and Dr. Boom, or pre-nerf Giggling Inventor.
---
So aye. You don't listen.

I don't need to convince you to have a valid point. How egotistical rofl.

The recent one was a mechacthun druid that didn't have anything to for the second naturalise to target.

I was playing odd warrior of that time instead of the other usual deck so didn't have access to geist and this was before the October/December nerf.  we both had nearly the same shit ton amount of armor, because initially i thought he was playing malygos/towaggle deck since there was still a fair amount of it at the time(they tried to kill you first with malygos then if that fail switch to azalina/towaggle combo). He got to greedy clearing my minion while i was making space for my hand.

---
Sure, but:
---
1. New players. 
---
2. Wild.
---
3. Card nerfs and meta shifts.
---
And my biggest gripe about Hearthstone's monetization isn't the f2p experience. It's that the "$75-$100 every set" price to enjoy the game *almost* fully is, in my opinion, not justified ("almost" because you still miss on some wacky "fun" decks, and because wild will be inaccessible for a new player).
---
When I started playing I thought the same. Thought it would be good to have some artifacts or somesuch in the collection manager you could 'equip' to increase the chance of packing cards from a specific class... 
---
But now I'm glad that wasn't a thing because I've ended up playing classes I originally thought I wouldn't...
---
I wasn't using one cheap deck to say the games f2p viable, I was just countering the argument that you need to make 60 cards to have a good deck in magic. Most of the time you need between 36 and 28 depending on the land base. 
---
There's other cheap decks that are viable too, I just used that one as an example because it's literally a tier 1 championship winning deck that is also among the cheapest to craft in the game.
---
I'm almost f2p player playing since open beta. I've spent on this game $10 on 2 welcome bundles. This month hit legend for the first time, but some months not playing at all. My current top tier or almost top tier decks:

I'd like to thank Blizzard for all the drama recently making it far easier to hate on them for all the mistakes they've made over the last few years. It's interesting watching them fall from grace. Keep up the good work!
---
I joined the game right after MSoG and I still miss the times with all the crazy control and midrange decks üòç
---
No, not at all. Scroll casts the spell which draws nothing and then you drew card which was the mercenary.
---
Venture Co was drawn as part of the scroll of wonders, not raiding party. 
---
Thanks, that makes sense
---
It took me a second to realize what happend there too.
---
It feels less though because the average pack does give 40 dust. And every once in a while a pack gives a few hundred dust to offset them. 
---
Most of the games features are dated and need reworked. It‚Äôs why I quit. You can‚Äôt jump in and not expect to spend money, it‚Äôs really just bullshit. 
---
That guy is a living corpse
---
I'm a big fan of Warpath. It's undeniably Warrior in flavour, uses the Echo mechanic really well and it's an interesting enabler for both control and Whirlwind synergy decks, like Wild Patron Warrior. 
---
Because it would be very problematic to suddenly ban cards which where originally meant to be playable for the rotation circle.
---
Why? 
---
I think a part of me is just sad venture co. isn't a pirate.
---
Because you already paid for it without anywhere being mentioned that cards may be rotated out/banned earlier.
---
The text on Frost Lich Jaina reads: "**Battlecry:** Summon a 3/6 Water Elemental. Your Elementals have **Lifesteal** this game."
---
Because it says "This game," you can take it as the equivalent to Raza's "For the rest of the game." Just a bit more concise because there's a fair bit of text on Frost Lich Jaina.
---
It's easily overlooked because you don't often play two different Hero Cards in one game (except Hunter now, ahaha), and permanent effects are not that common in Hearthstone. But yeah, it's a Permanent effect.
---
Same can be said for Dr. Boom's Mechs having Rush, though he does read "For the rest of the game"!
---
There aren't many permanent effects in Hearthstone. Those two, Crystal Core, maybe one or two that don't come to mind right now. Nether Portal is a "Permanent" as well, which is basically the same thing.
---
Whispers of the Old Gods
---
Then you would just get your dust, same way like with nerfes. 
---
Only if you hand over that sweet credit card info so I can buy kids for my children
---
ditto
---
It felt so good paying 20‚Ç¨ and then playing through the adventure every week and getting guaranteed cards.
---
Nowadays if you spend 20‚Ç¨ on Hearthstone you open a few packs that are filled with disappointment and regret and never feel like repeating that mistake again. I don't get people that have bought packs in the past and still like to buy them.
---
It's a bit more complicated when you start to ban cards. And it's a short view on things tbh. Because after genn/Baku you might have other cards. Then you ban these. Than players figure out something else which is banned etc.
---
It wouldn't be healthy for a game to simply ban everything considered "OP" by the community.
---
Yeah I was trying to estimate the average game time and with longer games probably at 10 and the shortest at a minute or less, 5 definitely feels about right. 
---

&gt; What do you think I said I didn't do?
---
&gt; Where?
---
Here. You were rude from the start, and denied it. But you were. 
---
&gt; No, I'm not admitting it. That's why I said "Assuming you're correct."
---
&gt; Because it's an assumption.
---
&gt; Sorry, but that's a real "duh" thing to even have to clarify.
---
.
---
&gt; That's from just one comment.
---
&gt; And before you "But it is completely irrelevant," "But it doesn't matter," "But you didn't answer those questions":
---
&gt; No shit, Sherlock. I didn't bother contesting these points because you were clearly too stubborn to be worthwhile.
---
How many times are you going to miss the point here? What I was asserting was that you were acting dismissive and rude *before* the post you so kindly linked to. You claimed you weren't, but you were. And here you are. All semblence of me trying to be polite went out the window at that point because you were being rude from the start. 
---
&gt; In that same comment you kept hinging on the word "oppressive," the word I expressly was not using.
---
We've already covered this. You didn't use the word oppressive. Just heavily implied it all the time. 
---
&gt; And instead of asking me what my point was about Zilliax, you instead put words in my mouth by supposing all that I've said is contradictory to the statement "Zilliax is not oppressive."
---
&gt; It ain't. And you'd know that if you just asked instead of decided to be pigheaded and know-it-all about it.
---
I repeatedly asked you what your reason for listing Zilliax in response to the OPs question was. Other than just being in a lot of decks of course, because I've already provided plenty of evidence as to why that isn't a valid answer. You never provided any other reasons. 
---
&gt; Ironic.
---
That's my line. You haven't fully understood a post I've made in a couple of hours. 
---
&gt; False dichotomy, in case you're still studying philosophy 101.
---
No. There's only two outcoms there. It's only a false dichotomy if you don't understand what is being said. Which we have already established is the case. 
---
&gt; That's not a fact. That's an opinion.
---
It is a fact. Zilliax is not oppressive in the way Boom and Inventor were. 
---
&gt; Do you know the difference between objectivity and subjectivity, Mr. Debate?
---
Yes. You on the other hand, could probably benefit from a bit of research in that regard. 
---
This is pretty funny to see, thinking about years ago when all you got was 5g for 5 wins. Yeah it was a bit ridiculous.

Ironbeak Owl used to cost 2 mana and was widely used as the best neutral silence. In 2016, Blizzard nerfed several cards with the aim of weakening silence's effect on the game overall. And thus the really bad Owl we know today was born.
---
Right, exactly :)
---
Yeah I have totally messed up with that figure. You get 48 packs from Elite AI and quite a lot of gold from the Single Player story content (I'd estimate another 40 packs worth?) I think the added confusion came from me adding in the 2000 gold from Private Matches, the gold from Achievements &amp; packs/gold from the massive amount of free Take 2 Tickets you receive. 
---
I've edited my original post to add the additional sources of income and changed to a more conservative value of 200 packs. 
---
oh..I hope that come faster 
---
I always figured its because they got some twats on the team, as you do in any company. So the twats get to create some cards and the other normal employees can't mess with their bad card designs. Then seeing as most cards are bad, the twats are either the majority (unlikely I think) or the people at the top (likely I think).

I'm saying I like deckbuilding in general in card games when it's accessible to me. I'm sure most people feel the same way, but that doesn't mean I expect card games to make fundamental shifts to their economy to make deckbuilding the focus. I enjoy playing the game enough to the point I don't feel like I'm missing out by not being able to experiment more than I do. If that's what I valued more, I'd play a different game.

Well... it all depends on the match up and the enemies ability to board clear. Odd Paladin, hunter and odd rogue are all great talanji targets, but odd warrior is pretty hard to do much against. The thing is, this whole deck is built around getting minions for talanji while also getting good value anyways (I.e stone hill defender, pi√±ata, etc.), thus she works really well. Talanji has allowed me to win tons of games due to the crazy swing, probably my favorite card of the expansion.
---
I got this deck from one of Kibler‚Äôs live-streams. My guess would be that he cut Zola for Talanji, but seance is essentially a better Zola in quest priest anyways so whatever.

If a kid is playing games online against others, they will be exposed to high amounts of insults, swear words and such. Only solution is to ban them playing online if that's the goal to avoid stuff.

You were probably playing big priest in casual ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è serves you right.

*cries in Brann*
---
Yes
---
The Trial of the Grand Crusader in WoW is an arena were you face off against a bunch of champions and then the ground crumbles and you face off against Anub'arak. This would not be out of character or out of place for Blizzard.
---
I like your deck. I think I will TAKE IT.
---
If there are only 3 minions in the game, then getting the same two is a 1/3 chance...

Buy heroes, buy dust, buy adventures.

I see a request to ban Barnes, I'm in. Oh and genn and Baku sure, don't really care so much. But get rid of Barnes please. 
---
I am a programmer and this is a very obvious bug. When there is a disconnection the client simply tries to reconnect. After the last update this doesn't happen, you can reconnect if in the first 20 seconds it happens you restart your client. This obviously could be avoided if the client tried to reconnect by itself.

---
I read all of this, I agree that the amount of board clears is very high. However I do not feel that is a problem. You always have some idea of when you are about to die to a priest. They did some setup before it, it didn't just happen.
---
I do not like big priest and it is my least favorite deck to see on ladder, but that's about it. I would not say priest needs a nerf overall, but I'd like to see big priest deleted.
---
I suppose your minions don‚Äôt make any sounds as well? Blizzard made a light app for mobile devices because they care about your [u]personal[/u] space, it‚Äôs optional to download golden animations and card sounds.

You should be glad that they‚Äôre frustrated it means you overwhelm them a lot lol

Everyday someone posts this bug with like the exact same title.
---
I really have to disagree; if Zillions weren‚Äôt a legendary I‚Äôd wholly be on board.
---
If anything, I think the ubiquity of Zillions denotes a poverty of comparable utility/tech cards in the neutral space. We should have more balanced, versatile cards to choose from rather than removing the few we have. Zil doesn‚Äôt define any deck, it rarely straight-out wins games (caveat: fuck you rez priest).
---
But most importantly, I think tools like Ziliax allow for the surprisingly diverse meta we currently have by giving decks that might otherwise be just shy of ladder-competitive a tool to let an otherwise slightly-too-inconsistent deck make a go of it.
---
It‚Äôs not a fun-killing card; all of the numbers involved are swingish but not meme-tier well-fuck-you-then flips of game state. And it‚Äôs *on the fucking board*, which in the current solitaire mode of HS is a breath of fresh air.
---
tl;dr we need more of Ziliax-style design, not less; ubiquity alone isn‚Äôt a criterion for hate
---
Thanks!
---
If you bought the old adventures, you can still play them and earn the cards they'd give you for beating them if you haven't already.
---
The new Solo content will still be available with their rewards still achievable.
---
Because you can‚Äôt trade or buy specific cards. Adding garbage to the pool to screw up your pity timer is a subtle but effective way to make you want to open more packs or spend more money. 
---
The rest are just cheap excuses (meme, casual playstyle, trolling, etc). You can troll with standard cards, you don‚Äôt need a legendary one to do the same 
---
I think the answer is 14 but I couldn't get through this entire math question.
---
Nothing official, but I think the only thing we are likely to lose are the card rewards for Ice Crown
---
Class balance seems to be one of the big driving factors for legendary card quality. When duskfallen aviana was released Druid had been dominating the ladder and didn‚Äôt need and extra tool in its arsenal. Shaman, who‚Äôd been hurting got shudderwock and hagartha
---
Actually, releasing more neutral cards causes more decks to run the same cards, making the game feel even more stale than if classes were well-differentiated. The staleness as a result of not being able to play certain decks for casual players is separate from the staleness of seeing the same cards in a deck at all levels.
---
They probably dont make them purposely bad from the start. But maybe the original version was too strong and there isnt a good way to reduce the power level without making the card bad. They also add chances to low-roll on random legendaries from cards like stormbringer, weaponized pinata, sindragosa, etc. which is kind of important for balancing those cards. And dont forget that just because a card is bad in constructed doesnt mean it is unpickable in arena. Griftah is pretty good in arena, and a lot of people thought it was unplayable. Duskfallen aviana is unplayable for sure, but im hard pressed to think of another that would never see play in any game mode. Playability is relative. When you have hundreds of cards to compare to, a lot of legendaries are bad (standard). When you only have 2 cards with similar pick rates to compare to, bad standard cards become good arena cards, and otherwise bad cards get taken because you need to fill in holes in your curve.
---
Yo what? That sounds like some shit I would play
---
Wait for the new expansion, a lot of decks will vanish after the rotation and they even said that they wanted to change Genn and Baku so I believe no deck is safe to craft if you want to play for more than 6 weeks.
---
Yeah, I'm gonna get like... two weeks? Because I've saved up all my sick leave for months?
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk is gonna have a field day with this one

Would be too hard to code, so likely no.

I really hope so. Would be a hassle to start grinding those adventures now as I don't play HS as much anymore.

I run it whenever I need to rank up a bit.  It is a very fast deck, it's not weak against anything in particular and it's uncommon enough that people have a hard time playing around it.
---
Something something small indie company..

Gotta say, your Idea actually looks like a lot of fun!
---
Not my idea.

The answer is only 14 when are 'rich' enough to go 2 months on 50% income. When you life paycheck to paycheck the answer is 12

It is mostly just druid, but Hakkar does enable a combo deck.
---
It goes like this: entirely or nearly empty deck, play hakkar (and hope it doesn't get silenced), later play togwaggle once your deck is only corrupted bloods, double naturalize.
---
It admittedly is not as safe as Mecha'thun or as versatile as Togg-Azalina, and it is in druid so it is also a bit unreliable in the first place. However, [people do still play it,](https://hsreplay.net/decks/rXuL16GGg90jZiWFjmL9jc/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD) presumably for fun factor in suddenly burning the opponent for 40+ damage with *Toggwaggle* of all things.

Well, yikes, getting so much shit for trying to give this guy some hope? The "hah" was unnecessary. 
---
It's still a T1 deck in Wild.
---
My life is filled with long shots so I'm pretty good at them, maybe this guy isn't that, but it never hurts to try. Belive me. Would be nice if you learned to be less rude. Thanks. 
---
You nailed my issue with a lot of the cards with overkill. There‚Äôs no way you‚Äôd want to use cards like baited arrow or Akali without triggering overkill. They‚Äôre borderline useless unless activated. 
---
You did this yourself.
---
Maybe don't disenchant your cards if you want them?
---
Just quit trying to lie, man.
---
It might be that the best agressive decks at the moment run either Baku, Keleseth or Master's Call, which all restrict the use of Shieldbreaker. In wild, however, pirate warrior has adopted it. 
---
As an infinite arena player since release who only plays in mobile, this has been the most frustrating bug. I've had to stop playing arena because of it

Tbf, I enjoy Ascension: Chronicles of the Godslayer myself, the expansions are far inbetween, the game is also fine without them, and once you get them, it has a high replay value (I played for like a year and never got bored, recently got it again on a new phone and it will probably last me a couple years more).

There are too many people in the US that abuse the system at every possible chance. Thats why we cant have the fancy nice things the europeans get.

---
I haven't seen it even once on ladder, so I'm thinking 'no'.
---
The idea of the deck is flawed... If you use the cards on turn 10 (where losing the crystals don't matter) you don't get enough benefit from it, the game is almost at an end.
---
If you use it early on, sure you get a lot of benefit from it... But the only decks that benefit that much from their minions having +2+2 are aggro and midrange, and aggro/midrange can't afford to 'roll back" three turns (Having 1 mana on turn 4, etc...)
---
Another way to put it: Turn 3 surrender to madness.
---
Turn 4, you play a 1 mana minion with +2+2. Say dire mole. It will be a 3-5 with the buff. ...Or you could just play Chillwind yeti on 4, a 4-5.
---
Turn 5, you play a 2 mana minion with +2+2. It will be something like a 5-4 with the buff. ...Or you could just play Pit Fighter on 5, a 5-6.
---
Turn 6, you will play a 3 mana minion with +2+2. It will be something like a 5-6 with the buff. ...Or you could just play Boulderfist Ogre on 6, a 6-7.
---
The fact that you roll back 3 mana makes your minions, even buffed minions, worse than minions you could've played naturally on the respective turns. Not just that, but worse than *trash minions no one plays*. 
---
Of course if you play more minions it's better, because you get multiple buffs... Say, instead of playing a 3-2 on 5 that is buffed to a 5-4, you play two 1-3 so you get two 3-5... But two 3-5 on 5 isn't even anything special. Saronite chain gang is two 2-3 on 4, and it sees next to no play since the nerf. And it doesn't cost you an additional card/losing 3 mana.
---
Short answer: No, it's just a meme deck. You can probably find a way to use the spell 3-4 times and then you play dire moles bigger than giants, and it's hilarious... But other than that, it's useless.
---
you *still* didn't answer the question 
---
r/fuckhunter
---
Yep, and it doesnt really matter what the average is outside of expansion days when you are opening over 40 packs with a guaranteed legendary when the average experience is awful. What's the point of the statistics if the game doesn't feel fun and you have to drag yourself through games to try and get a pack a day, but you know that 80% of the time its going to 40 dust. The aVeRAgE pACk giVeS yOu 100 dUsT becomes more annoying when it is common for you to open up 5 packs to get 200 dust total and it takes you near a month in order to finally get a legendary to balance you closer to that 100 dust average but then you gotta deal with the fact that you opened Hir'eek, and got 32 more packs to go until you can get yourself a shiny new griftah. 
---
Statics are cool and all but they have no real meaning outside of the long term. 
---
I don't mean to be rude, just realistic. I work in the IT and I have a good idea on how the things move at this level. I'm really sorry for the OP, but the best way is still to have Blizzard intervene on the issue, or at least giving informations (even an IP address that could help your "long shot" suggestion on filing a police complaint). 
---
"Doing nothing" in the economic sense of "not providing value to others in exchange for money". The kid isn't paying anyone to take care of him, so said care is subsidized by the employer/taxes.
---
True. 
---
You know what they're not? Owned and built by Activision/Blizzard. :)
---
Oh shoot I guess I had a midrange Shaman deck all along. I always feel like an asshole whenever I coin out faceless turn 3.
---
I just thought the comparison was ridiculous, hearthstone is essentially a service. A customer who has likely spent a lot of money lost his digital cards, which are completely trivial to restore. Helping them costs nothing, and keeps a good customer around. Ethics aside, from a purely business standpoint, it's dumb to not help him. 
---
It's really too late now but the two factor authentication is free from blizzard if you use a mobile phone.  It would have stopped anyone from accessing your account instantly.  They gave you the tools to help with this issue and you didn't use them.
---
Yes... But the rotation/expansion will come in about 2 months or so. If you're trying to be dust-efficient, you should not buy any new pack until it happens. You should buy the next ones that will last a full 2 years.
---
If you buy them now, they'll only last 1 year (well, 1 year and 2 months, the rotation after this one), and you'll need packs from the new set anyway.
---
Don‚Äôt want to burst your circlejerk, but they only fired people who didnt work on the game. They said in their earnings report that they will use more resources on game development. HS did not lose people working on the game, they gained. 
---
If it's a new format, why does it have to be class based? Pick your hero, use any cards from your 10 packs. 
---
Sure, it might devolve into everyone only picking Warlock, but the pleasure of deck-building on the fly would be more than make up for it.
---
Don't know the language so used google translate and Ëá™Ëµ∞Ê£ã means self-playing chess, so auto chess confirmed coming to HS.
---
Wasn't accusing him of anything, just pointing out a negative externality of subsidizing time off for one thing and it being used for another thing due to the impracticalities of enforcing the purpose. Same thing with 'food stamps' being used for 'necessities'; it's very difficult to police, so there are ways to get around it and use the benefit in undesired ways.
---
A "kid" trying to help someone, but ok. I guess internet doesn't belive in hope or being less than rude. 
---
This is really important to avoid these unfortunate situations.
---
....so 85% of women in the same age bracket *do* have children? 85 is still greater than 15, right, or did I miss a balance patch?
---
And anyway, paternal leave applies to both parents.
---
Finally, if I've read your link correctly, it's suggesting that 15% is actually indicative of a *decline* in childless women in 2012, down from 20% in previous years. This feels super cherrypicked my dude
---
Completely agree. His story doesn't add up.
---
If you're hacked, Blizzard historically will revert your account back to a previous state. The customer service has never been awful on Blizzard's side, even if they make mistakes from time to time. They tend to be very forgiving.
---
And like you pointed out, his claim is that he was playing the game, got DC'd because someone logged in, and when he recovered his login the collection is gone. Unless there's some hidden button that disenchants all your collection, there was simply no time to do damage to his account. And that rogue login was done through SMS authentication, which he validated.
---
So the story here is that someone logged in while OP was also logged in, while also using OP's phone number to validate the login, and in a matter of 5 minutes (at best, because OP claims to have logged back in immediatly) the third person is said to disenchant $1200 worth of cards. 
---
They also pointed out that much of his collection is still available and that he has 47k dust. 
---
So either OP's outlandish story is true and someone managed to bypass double authentication and disenchant more cards than is possible within the timeframe, or - more believably - OP or someone on OP's account disenchanted the collection and now OP is trying to get it back without admitting to wrongdoing or account sharing. 
---
Delete all decks first....
---
Wow ok news to me.
---
That's really great actually. OP chances increased.
---
This *probably* means you have a full version installed, it would be easier to determine if you answered my question about card sounds. Otherwise I can only guess. Also Blizzard can disable animations for mobile devices via hotfixes, they did it before, they never stated a reason why the did it, but this didn‚Äôt mean there was none
---
OP did have two-factor authentication already, according to the conversation in the screenshots. Something doesn't add up.

The peak was witchwood for me. I got #1 in the arena leaderboard and Caverns of time came out for a month where arena received unique cards that wasn't seen anywhere else. The bucket system also came around that time as well. Basically witchwood probably had the largest attention given to arena and that was a great time for arena players like me.

&gt; Hello, I had An account that was deleted, along with my irl friends account.My entire collection si deleted.All i have is the lich king and a few commons +1.1k dust.I used to have Quest Warrior, Grommash Hellscream,Scourgelord garrosh, and a couple epics and i think one or two more legendaries.I really miss my account and so DID my friend.
---
He contacted support within a week and got his account reversed back with the legendaries he got form Boomsday.
---
I did the same but the gamemasters said they can't/won't help,But my friend contacted and he was fine within a couple hours.I really miss my account so bad, and I have lots of nostalgia and sadness thinking abou tit.I've spent a decent amount of money on the game.I dont get allownace or work so I can't do a new account.Is there anything that I can do?
---
all because they got greedy and disenchant their collection again and try to scam blizzard. he tried to play it's his friend who got their collection back, when it's his brother who he share the account with(which break tos).
---
You're right, I missed that on the third screen. So he got the alert that someone was trying to log in on his account, and then approved it? WTF?
---
If this has no value, why does the OP care, not being a physical item, is not the same as having no value.
---
I would love for D4 to go back to what I used to love about the series. D3 missed it entirely. There was talk about a Dark Souls style arpg instead, though...
---
Jumping on the auto chess bandwagon

Blizzard GMs were once known for doing whatever they could to satisfy the customer, but now they are trained how to say "no, can't help you." It's been like that for years now, an ex-GM for WoW actually wrote up a really detailed and informative sort of behind-the-scenes comment explaining the degrading customer service [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/a7rrmy/a_letter_to_blizzard_entertainment/ec62dvi/)
---
Blizzard always do their announcements at 10am PST which has now passed so it is very unlikely.
---
Hearthstone should have something like wow (if you set up the authenticator you get an additional row in your inventory) maybe give a classic pack or something. Easy way to make people use it
---
Rush mechanic. 
---
Can you share your decklist?
---
I play exclusively on mobile.  I certainly don‚Äôt experience it anywhere near 1 in 7 - maybe more like 1 in 100.  Also, you can tell if you pay attention to the client and notice things such as the emotes (hmmm for example) and obviously the lack of rope.  I also agree that if they were to compensate this is massively abusable and thus not a realistic request. 
---
Sometimes it's 10:30 but I wouldnt expect it 
---
exactly, there was no ransom request, nothing was gained. I understand there are bad people doing dumb things for no reason but I sincerely don't understand the logic.
---
Really? I've never seen an announcement at 10:30 only ever at 10. 
---
Oooooh, how did none of us think of this sooner?! If you save the dust, you can use it later instead of using money!
---
Uh hey reddit users I know this is basically me speaking Chinese to you, but if you're going to comment on a post you should actually read the post.   
---
To all the people saying "So you didn't have 2FA?" - It literally says in the screenshots that he did. OP has omitted this information intentionally. There is more to the story we don't know so its difficult to make heads or tails of this.   
---
Even if OP was logged into multiple devices for tournament play, they would have to specifically check mark the box to add the device to a trusted list. I know OP wants sympathy, but I am very skeptical.   
---
Really strange. Also the time window shouldn't be long enough to delete $1200 in cards, unless I'm missing some secret way to disenchant cards in bulk. 
---
Read the last sentence my other comment. Then read the GMs response about him turning on 2FA on EVERY login attempt. 
---
Aggro. Ive faced a guy playing zoo. He was pretty cool i find out he was a father. I guess being a parent forces u to play aggro. Tight schedules
---
in the past, stories like these eventually turn out that OP disenchanted everything to make a new deck and then decided they didn't like it.
---
blizz usually does rollbacks when accounts are genuinely hacked.
---
On top of that why specifically Hearthstone, of all the Blizzard games, why did they choose Hearthstone to login to. Makes me thinks it was someone who knew you played Hearthstone.
---
1200 is a lot for a card game. Unlucky. I Hope Bli$$ard sort you out (But judging the way Bli$$ard have been recently I doubt it!)
---
&gt; Priests had already been dominating the meta before the recent update 
---
Gotta disagree a bit, Priest has been in the thrash can since KnC, the reason priest got strong this expansion isn't because of the set itself, but because of others "God Tier" classes like druid got nerfed, because of that nerf hunter got stronger, and priest is just good against them.
---
I agree with you with the wall priest deck, and i think divine spirit should be moved to HoF, its a boring card that can only work to set an otk.
---
Heh, rat trap did it again! "You didn't even play rat trap"
---
Well, yeah, so It just might be at Thursday as one week later after the "New format" was announced.
---
Best expansion 
---
The difference is that your situation happened 2 years ago, when Blizzard still gave a shit.
---
Today is a different story.
---
&gt;They don't help because they can't.
---
... the certainly can rollback. 
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not saying the hero powers are always OP, just that in the decks that DO use them, they are the singularly powerful part of those decks.
---
And those decks are very powerful. 
---
Pushing the ratio of decks is only possibly by either adding stronger cards. The ways you outlined don‚Äôt sound too different from power creep. More variety doesn‚Äôt fix things if that variety isn‚Äôt strong enough to compete with what‚Äôs already powerful.
---
If I‚Äôm playing odd warrior, any new card that competes with the upgraded hero power is going to have to be able to compete with 4 armor per turn for the whole game. 
---
The only way I‚Äôm going to loose the upgraded hero power is for a SUPER strong card:
---
Otherwise known as powercreep.
---
I saw people saying it the day Krag'Wa was released. Pretty sure its an obvious combo that a lot of people came up with independently. 
---
If he had all golden legendaries, it would take about 3 minutes to dust enough to get to 140k. Seems sketch
---
It was a horrible example, but what matters is that he could have put an actual good example there instead.
---
Do you lock your car doors?  There are a lot of people who just check cars to see if the door is unlocked and if so they grab whatever they can find from inside the car, otherwise they move on to the next car.

This is a pretty teched list for aggro, if you ant any cards explained just ask.
---
I stopped about 6 months or so ago.  Not sure on the exact time but there are two new expansions out since I stopped.  Started again about a week ago just for shits and giggles.
---
Now this admittedly in Wild, but literally *nothing* has changed.  I'm playing with the exact same decks against the exact same decks as when I left.
---
Dragon Soul? Really? Are we gonna complain about Gruul and The Beast next?
---
My company offers up to 4 months paternity leave. Almost nobody takes that much.
---
I took 2 weeks for each of my kids.
---
Exactly. And with the prevalence of voidlord and obsidian statue, it's 100% worth it. 
---
Honestly, you could literally sell uses of Sorry (10 uses for 100 gold) and people would buy that shit.  My boyfriend would sink money into that.
---
Nothing quite like getting BMed while knowing your opponent spent extra money just to BM you even harder.
---
I think your objection is why blizzard has refused to do this.  Differing card art will confuse people.
---
I personally find this objection to things absurd.  People can read.  It's a TCG, you should be expected to read cards you don't recognize.  Secondly it's for mostly legendaries.  You should be able to realize zilax wearing a silly outfit is still zilax.  
---
No, normal dust value. You can choose to keep them to play in wild. 
---
Thank you!
---
There's no way this is real. 
---
No problem. If in doubt, just ask in this thread. And generally only get rid of cards if you have a full deck that you want to craft and you need x amount of dust. There's no benefit to dusting a card if you're not going to use that dust immediately. Also with the standard rotation coming up soon, some of the former 'unplayable' cards might actually see play soon.
---
&gt;The voice of someone who has never looked after an infant all day.
---
Wrong.
---
Dude...
---
&gt; I do not believe that blizzard CS can't do anything about OP's problem. They just don't want too.
---
Or, more likely, we aren't getting the full story from OP.
---
I don't know, but my point is simply that, from Blizzard's perspective, they did a marketing test which came back with a thoroughly negative result. It may well be that it's a test that should be repeated with different parameters, but it's going to hard to sell the marketing management on the idea given how adverse the reaction was last time.  
---
In order to Blizzard to consider an idea like this, they need to be convinced that there is sufficient demand to warrant the risk of another backlash. I'm not sure how we can make that case to them. 
---
We need more people like you.
---
Wow, dude. Unfortunate to hear that. I really hope things like mandatory mat/pat leave for a rational amount of time pass for you guys some day. It really doesnt help the family situation with the stress of a new baby, the cost of the new babys bills(i know that you guys dont have babiees for free in the hospital like we do), on top of worrying about your job. Jesus, that sounds like a terrible scenario.
---
My wife had postpartum depression, and if she only had 8 weeks off, she wouldn't have come back from that...
---
Paid or unpaid? Makes a big difference. Probably the 4 months is for if your kid has something that requires more attention or you're a single parent. 
---
All everyone would ever do is reroll quests then, especially if the quest rewards are larger proportionally (Winning three games gets us fifty gold, so winning fifteen gets two-fifty). 
---
If you only get one quest a day, and it can either be worth fifty or two to three hundred gold but the player gets to choose, which one do you think most people will actually choose?
---
I also doubt people would do more than screw around in casual to complete quests that require specific sorts of decks like you mentioned. Smart players won't risk rank on ladder trying to play decks made to just complete quests. People already do that right now for stuff like Divine Shield minions and Murlocs.
---
"Fine" is subjective. The game is balanced. The game is also stale. The decks are about equal in power but are almost all old decks. 
---
All the DK heroes, Carnivorous Cube, Vilecleaver, Spellstones, Togwaggle, Oakheart
---
All paid.
---
The technology isn't there yet
---
Ben Brode is too busy working on a rap
---
but the casual experience
---
not all cards can be good enough to see play
---
We want to keep the game fun and interactive
---
rngstone
---
Pick 2 of the above, your idea (while good) won't see the light of day for those 2 reasons.
---
Also true for a huge chunk of the minion voice lines. They can skip that step with creatures and objects and the sort, but plenty of minions have spoken dialog.
---
Plus, the storage impact of sounds in all the extra languages is an issue that needs dealing with regardless. I believe the mobile client already has languages separated into their own downloads. The desktop client will inevitably get the same treatment as the game grows.
---
&gt;You seem to be believe that investment in families is a bad subsidy
---
I'm not even debating right now whether it's a good or bad subsidy; I'm simply questioning whether a subsidy is/can be a "human right".

Old gods. Fuck I miss old gods

Spellbreaker isn't a beast.
---
Seriously, opening the collection when I log in takes forever and when I try and disenchant a card the game usually freezes for about a minute before it goes through. Maybe Blizzard is protecting us from hackers by having the game run like a potato.  
---
&gt;so few ways to get rid of an opponent's weapon
---
There are currently like at least 7 neutral cards that destroy weapons... 
---
Not possible...
---
Play midrange hunter or odd paladin, they play themselves
---
Have you ever encountered a bot on ladder?its clear they‚Äôre bots because they don‚Äôt hover cards, they just snap play them. They do so by basically sending the ‚Äúplay this card command‚Äù
---
The hearthstone client is a GUI- graphical user interface. Any time you click a button, you‚Äôre sending that button‚Äôs command to the server- click ‚Äúdisenchant Wisp‚Äù and you‚Äôre sending the ‚Äúdisenchant wisp‚Äù command (although Wisp would probably look like a more complicated ID), and the client is popping up a ‚Äúare you sure‚Äù box in return. 
---
If you‚Äôre not using a client- that is, you‚Äôve created a text interface- you can skip all the annoying pop ups, and just send ‚Äúdisenchant card1‚Äù ‚Äúdisenchant card 2‚Äù etc for all cards. And that‚Äôs pretty easy to automate, so in a short matter of time you could disenchant everything starting with legendaries, then epics, for maximum destruction value. 
---
Don‚Äôt bother, this deck is crap
---
I feel like Crystallizer should get more love than it does already, tbh. 
---
Okay, for now make sure your devices are up to date, and then try the restoration. Also, while over WiFi, see about turning off the network devices for a full minute before reconnecting and then retesting.
---
If you find that the issue persists, I would recommend that you report the device models, your iOS version, and then the description of the issue [here](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/hearthstone/10881288/) in our Mac tech forums. Ty!
---
Apreciate your response and the guide
---
Alex and Shudderwock seems like a strange combination to me
---
What we can tell
---
1)There are a lot of Priests
---
2)There are a lot of Midrange Hunters
---
3)There are a lot of Mages (probably odd ones)
---
You only get full dust value based on the limit of copies you can include at the same time, based on the "highest rarity" in your collection;
---
keeping the Malygos as an example, you can only include 1 copy of it, so if you have a regular Malygos, you'll get 1600 dust.
---
If you have 2 regular Malygos, you'll get 1600 dust.
---
If you have a Golden Malygos, you'll get 3200 dust.
---
If you have both a Regular AND Golden Malygos, you'll get 3200 off the Golden one.
---
Good riddance to Rexxar and Jaina

Jaina and Rexxar.
---
Your healing deals 1 damage
---
Prove yer' worth, *CUR*
---
Master Oakheart. Fuck that card, its never been fun to play against. 
---
Or just delete him
---
Probably simply a difference of one-of versus two-of.
---
want to*
---
YES. So glad for you, and thank you for the reminder to set up my authenticator! I just set it up so hopefully I won't have to go through the headaches you did. 
---
Thank you for your help. It actually seems like I am not the only person with that problem. Multiple reports on the same issue are already filed in the Mac tech forum. I did not even know it existed. Thanks for your efford!
---
Kiwi n bacon and control also played some varients
---
The link worked for me. 
---
the image says "in % of decks" though
---
that would be the good result for them, I just anticipate no one will bother to play this way.
---
Are there clientless bots for HS though?
---
OREZAZ#2365,  Trading 80g quest. you go first. 
---
How on Earth does Hunter ever run out of steam with a 3 Mana Draw 3 and Deathstalker Rexxar?
---
sure, no problem!
---
Psychic Scream in particular should die. DK Jaina and Rexxar have outstayed their welcome, too.
---
There is not something inherently wrong with sets with high power levels. My second favourite format of yugioh was DUEA which HAT to DUEA was like playing 2 different games with the difference in power level. 
---
Pre-nerf control cube lock is also my favourite hearthstone deck of all time and while I understand why it was nerfed, I wish it wasn't
---
Is Blue Portal considered old? Because Blue Portal.
---
Firefly, to me, is the best designed card of all time.  You also have to consider the set it came out in.  It not only had synergy with everything you just mentioned, but the Hunter and Rogue quests as well.
---
Midrange Hunter, (Heal)Zoo Warlock. They have nut draws that are just unbeatable in the early game.
---
Haha, not even the only two runs I did yesterday. I have been going hard this month :$
---
Haha!
---
I'm curious though, did they managed to find out if op really got hacked or it's because of outside pressure and they just want to get it over with.
---
In the past, the customer support managed to believe this 1 person  story when it was all a lie. He claimed his account got hacked when it was actually done by his own brother because they shared account(breaking tos?)
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/9agkuv/is_my_account_completely_screwed/

Good thing that person was dumb and greedy enough to try it again and fail to get the collection back.
---
Seems legit, I'm in.

Northshire cleric wow ... that's a lot of priest popularity.

UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who reported this. I upgraded all files and made sure everything is clean. There are no redirect links detected on the site. Clear your cache, and check the site again.

Now I'm trying to figure out if Starving Buzzard is the most brutal nerf of all time or if there is another card we might be forgetting.
---
Hah! Thx i guess?

I just want to be able to buy a WowHobbs voice over pack.  I'd play shaman over and over again just to play bloodlust.

This could be a server error, a flaw in their security, inadequate controls to prevent loss of property, or otherwise their fault.

Try initiating a lawsuit. Somebody will unfuck this for you right away.

i wish i had the Naxxramas one but i started few times after. My prefered is Highmaul simple but i love it
---
Thank you very much.

That's a really helpful info. Maybe I'll wait to April before crafting any card.
---
I've been looking this info for days, maybe weeks.

Thank you again :D I also found this.

I love this notion that people have that big companies are incapable of making bad business decisions. History is filled of big corporations that failed to adapt and ended it up failing.
---
iwata actually took 2 paycuts, during the initial failed launch of 3DS and during wiiu. his normal salary was around 700k iirc
---
To be fair Blizzard has a history of canceling games rather than release something they feel is not up to par.
---
* Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans (it's been about 20 years and I'm still bitter)
---
* Starcraft: Ghost
---
* Titan
---
Tack!

How I made the game less frustrating:  I don't grind 150 wins in a week.  It just isn't that important.  I also don't care about the rank 5 thing.
---
Play when you enjoy it.  Ideally get your quests done each day.  Less important, hit rank 5.  But those are in order, if you're willing to dust bad cards you can add new decks.  Slowly, but the vast majority of your dust/gold income is just from the daily quest.
---
I think it's interesting that only one of the wild cards is actually from a wild set
---
I used to play it in buff paladin when good 1 drops did not exist for the deck
---
I mean, OP‚Äôs collection did get restored/rolled back, so I have to assume they got their shit together eventually. 
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be detected by default, and I doubt any employee would care enough to dig into how rapidly the cards were deleted, they only care if the account was actually hacked or not 
---
Alt art a are just one of the many ways you can introduce cosmetics. You can have more heroes, emotes, boards, cardbacks.
---
I love the Diablo card back that was given out during a brawl event like 2(?) years ago. It's my default since I got it. 
---
The decklists!
---
First time since the last time. 
---
I never really set out to grind 150 in a week, that's just how much faster it went when I started throwing away the unfavorable and longer matchups I wasn't enjoying.  
---
A 10+ minute match that could net me a win though more likely a loss ended up being a few seconds loss to move onto the more likely win.  
---
Fair point, hopefully they continue that trend and do not follow Bethesda in decline of quality.  
---
Stevenwoo#1131 NA. Looking to trade 80g. You go first and I‚Äôll show. I'll play suicidelock for quick completion. Thanks! 
---
Thank you, always good to have some context. 
---
If he is overpayed by "13 million" that seems to make the largest part of the difference. 
---
Anything that lets you go infinite, even if not OP.  Dead Man's Hand
---
Even Archbishop Benedictus.  Technically not infinite, but adds so many cards that the possibility of beating them with fatigue goes out the window unless you also have a "go infinite" play.
---
Blizzard and activision merged over 10 years ago, blizzard and activision are both greedy fucks lets not pretend only one company is at fault here.
---
There is such a thing as a free-to-play game giving away so much value there's no incentive for players to ever start buying content. As such, if ninety percent of players are earning four to five times as much gold and as a result four to five times as many packs as they would otherwise, that could actually be where problems start to reasonably arise on the business side of things.
---
If players would have to play on ladder to complete those sorts of quests, then low ranks in Wild would start being even more of a cakewalk for people playing decent deck than it already is.
---
Those that's suck.
---
TIME TO PLAY CAMEL HUNTER!
---
Is Jaina nerfed 
---
Rank 5 is an easiest thing to do. Usually get it as soon as new month begins. But yea after that point the game just becomes "do quest/brawl close the game"
---
I have only ever gotten to rank 7 once so rank 5 seems practically impossible. I have been sitting at 20-15 for the past year and have just given up trying to climb since it‚Äôs not fun. I want to play a deck I enjoy, but those usually have lower win rates and therefore cause me to drop ranks. Any advice on pushing through the grind to rank 5 with boring tier 1 decks?
---
Yep, Shaman and warrior have both seen play in meta decks, but they aren't that ridiculous level of power.  They feel more like the recent hero cards.  Malfurion kind of feels like that as well, in that it's powerful, but it doesn't do a ridiculous amount.  Just, druid getting it out early made it very strong.
---
I can't believe some streamers thought that card would be bad..i came back recently after years and when I saw that card I couldn't believe it existed lol
---
Just through both you and your opponents (amazing) names, I have already failed to expect the unexpected 
---
There might be more of them running around if they weren't insanely priced at $10 each.
---
Doing things that make sense goes against Blizzard's game design.
---
Lich king?  Was it that annoying to face off against?
---
Ouch!
---
You misunderstand. "Blizzard" is just a name now. The people that were Blizzard are gone and Blizzard no longer exists beyond being a brand name.
---
Patches juuuust barely didn't make it into this picture at #6 on the Wild list. lol
---
filled with cats
---
Yup. Recently started playing path of exile and dedicated players SHELL OUT for cosmetic items.
---
This is the Chinese interface of the store. The second one means arcane dust, which is the same as card packs (buy dust and get packs for free). The third one is Autochess, which is photoshoped.
---
For reference, Sweden gives 480 days (16 months at seven days a week, or 22 months at five) of which each parent has to take at least three months or those three months are lost. Also the first 400 days pay significantly better than the last 80. It's not uncommon for the mother to take a full year off, and then the father takes another six months - that comes out to almost exactly 400 days.
---
I think that's the best outcome, right? What are the other high bodied 2 drops that you would want to be summoned (not played) 
---
You should be spending more time with your son
---
Congrats!
---
Honestly, Hearthstone is never going to improve even if people stop paying. They've been successful for so long that when payers stop paying, they'll just shut it down or relaunch "Hearthstone 2" or some shit. 
---
I am privileged for having that opportunity.  I feel sorry for your kids because you found no value in it, not because you couldn't do it.  You are here mocking people for wanting the time off to benefit their kids.  You should probably tell all the psychologists and pediatricians that kids who are twelve don't remember time spent with parents when they are 18 mo and younger - I bet that never occurred to them when they declared those 18 months the most important for child bonding.
---
Simple.
---
Preparation, Channel, Counterfeit Coin, Disintegrate. Guaranteed T1 kill!

Interesting that only one of the cards in the Wild section is wild only 
---
Yes. Now I can finally feed him.

Try bonemare. 9/9 worth of stats +taunt, but you need a minion on board and don't get DK cards
