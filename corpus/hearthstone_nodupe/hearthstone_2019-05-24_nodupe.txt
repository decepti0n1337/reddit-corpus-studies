Squashling is TERRIBLE in the streets of Dalaran wing, which is the wing Priest was released in.  Seems a little odd to me.
---
honestly i thought he was stealth nerfed and even was like "yup thats fair"
---
Yea it hard carried me. I just wanna have some fun. At first I filled my deck with "DIE INSECT"s and the gaming is boring as the board is quickly filled, so I decide to do some Hagatha shenanigans.
---
That would be cool to be honest. Have a one boss that is pulling the best deck from legend every week/month and boost it a little bit (for example starting with 3 mana). Powerlevel of Dalaran is already high so it could be beatable.
---
Thank you Khadgar, very cool!
---
If you would spend dust crafting Zayle then yes, otherwise no, but bear in mind that Zayle won't be unlocked (for people who didn't spend $) until a couple weeks from now.
---

---
Also Zayle is pretty trashy and you should just craft Whizbang instead.  In summary, no not worth it unless you like the PvE.
---
That interaction is kind of wierd. Your starting Hagathas will cost 3 but other Hagathas you draw and the Horror you assembled cost 2.
---
So I realized this after I started reading people’s. I don’t know how many bosses there are and it seems like each boss has a bunch of different reactions to each class and multiple different cards. Maybe at some point we can split them up to each different boss. I’m sure it’ll be online at some point though.
---
You have a lot of heal.  Have you thought about squeezing a Lucentbark in there?
---
Like a non-vegan Kripp
---
Nice 107 health!
---
What horrible ones?  This week is great, I can't remember what last week was.
---
The meta is still settling it may still end up with 2
---
Agree. Did someone think this is fun and would be a good idea? Why don’t they at least do something on death rattle? This single play doesn’t feel very thematic and it feels like the same dungeon run again. The main problem is that this wing is just not fun.
---
I thought you were matchmade against people with similar amounts of wins at least, I believe there is some kind of soft MMR system.
---
lock n load and unleash the hounds were my last cards after opponent played azari. clutched zuljin from lock n load and AI didn't kill my minions.
---
The same thing happened with hunter secrets. All other decks have only 1 secret card total. Very hard to unlock. If I beat heroic with all other decks and hero powers and I still am less than half way to unlocking one based on specific cards then this is not good game design.
---
What ever is wrong in your life that leads you to try and hurt people, I hope it gets better.
---
The only single player mode which feel thematic was escaping a collapsing mine in LOE.
---
Maybe if they patch them they will :) this week's wing is really lame, I haven't even played Rogue yet because I don't feel like revisiting last week's wings and I did my first run to get packs on Priest.
---

No surprise with control warrior and Conjurer Mage being up there lol
---
YOU FACE JARAXXUS
---
I mean, team 5 are the ones who chose to have 5 wings that they sell separately.  If they can't design enough bosses to make the wings feel different from each other, that's their problem.
---
You already played 2 cards for your ability to cut the cost in half
---
I ended up crafting it the other day. 9 lives does trigger it. Seems like a pretty under rated card in mech hunter. So many 7/7 dragons and spider bomb board clears.
---
Darkschoko#2139 europe, you go first for the trade
---
Sometimes content has to be introduced progressively and not like overwhelming the players. I think it can have many negatives, but yes overall probably would add some coolness to the game. But consider adding this many skins just this time would be odd, and adding so many 3 times a year would be more odd.
---
In terms of dust value, arena. In terms of fun value, dalaran.  In terms of instant and short lived gratification, packs.
---
Stiiiiill need the snake shaman for that
---
I did similar, but with Expedite, on \[\[Shadow Ascendant\]\]. It was awesome.

---
Rogue isn’t mage or priest. Their high cost spells, aside from vanish, don’t have much impact overall on the game, and they kill tempo for a tempo oriented class, hence why prep was needed as an activator, so they can do something else with their turn. A mage can afford to spend six or seven mana on a spell, because board clears are extremely powerful, but if a rogue plays sprint at seven mana, they’ve killed their tempo for the turn, which will ultimately hurt them more than the benefit they gain by drawing 4.

I feel ripped off (again) ... it's just the same bosses over and over again. Could have just continued to play Wing 1 and the experience would not have been much different.
---
In Dungeon Run (an old solo-player adventure) there was a boss called "Tad" who would pull minions from his deck and if you withstood that and didn't do any damage to you he'd give you a special item for your deck. "Tad's pole" was a really good weapon that pulled minions from the enemies deck and basically made the rest of the run much easier.

There are sometimes secrets in these solo-player adventures, whether they be just voicelines, really rare encounters, or loot.

I’ve been focusing on working my hunter Mechrattle deck. I’d like to get a few more cards so I can have another deck, so I may go the packs route.. thanks!!

I dusted my golden Deathwing and I definitely regret it considering I have a complete classic set now.
---
Yea I’ve been basically focusing on upgrading my hunter Mechrattle, so Id like to get more cards for another deck.  Thanks for the advice!

I haven't watched the youtube channel yet, but I watch lots of Asmo's streams, and just "More of the same" on the channel would be perfect, to be honest!
---
Maybe some interesting games/cool matchups, hitting important ranks, etc. 
---
I like 'lengthy segments' more than quick highlights that pass from 1 "clip" to the other every 30 seconds. It's fine to have them once in a while when there's a really funny/interesting moment to highlight, but a full video of just that, it's not as fun.

You're on crack man. Run the numbers. 20 games winning 10 in a row, and 20 games winning every other game. Same win % but 2+ levels difference depending on the level bracket. That couldn't be more unrepresentative of how often you win. Hearthstones ladder isn't really a ladder at all between 20-5. Its not like Overwatch, (or even legend) where winning basically displaces another player's rank who just lost...  Its just a group of buckets where players of pretty equal skill duke it out to get to the next floor where the players might be incrementally better.

I used it on a zero cost Knuckles that also had the +4/+4 thinking hey, this will be fun. It gave me normal knuckles but my minions had rush so I actually was able to use this to my advantage for a completion. :) So I’ve had luck.
---
Opened golden Yogg. Am blessed by RNG gods. Can confirm.

You sound like a very nice, sensible and literate person.

I feel like you should get a Golden Millhouse after doing this .

I hope you guys are for real this time! Subbed to asmo like 2 years ago and was so sad there was no content after a while, since it is hard for me to regularly tune in to the stream due to work etc.
---
Pumped to hear that! Will check out the content once I am home. :)
---
Fair enough, but I get it, I play solo, because I have no friends that play or haven't reached out in-game too much or added anyone in OW at least.
---
you could even flex ysera if you run into decks that go face - sometimes you have so much card draw with acolytes (because with whip you get automatic 2 card value draw per drop) ysera takes too long to get value for cost (x1.5 for 2nd card from dream)
---
and more so if she is sitting in your hand next to deathwing himself

so could swap ysera for another fun legendary, tech, the above mentioned - or i have been testing **gorehowl?**

The zayle decks feel better then whizbang in my oppinion. The roge deck is basiclly tempo rogue so very good, silence priest and rush warrior is good enough in most cases. The warlock and the shaman look pretty weak. But a smaller pool in decks mean you have to learn a smaller amount of decks (what for a new player can be better). Also there are some REALLY bad Whizbang decks.
---
He and the rogue (cat pirate) has a special interaction

Well they already reprinted Ursa-tron into hearthstone.

---
if value for dust was no consideration you might have some trace of a point. whizbang updates with new cards every expansion. as far as we know the only update zayle's decks are ever going to receive is the replacing of cards that rotate out of standard next year.
---
looks awesome, but, how does he use that mace? although i gotta admit that weapon does look quite fierce
---
I feel your enthusiasm!
---
I am currenly laddering with a wild token druid list, am having a blast and reached a higher rank (R9/3) than since ages (was R7 once with dude pally in standard; in wild I never got beyond R13 thus far). I am even considering to push for R5...
---
If we’re complaining about bosses, I can’t stand Carousel Gryphon.
---
Doubt it. One of the thread had 5 Millhouses at 5 Attack. While we don't see the health of the boss, we see the HP of the player, which is 50. So the boss has at least 60 HP.
---
Kalecgos? Yeah, he's alright. Works in most slow mage lists.
---
Scargill? Don't know about that, most murloc lists don't even run him.
---
Muerte? Not very good right now. Works in big priest in wild, but worth it only if you have the rest of the deck ready.
---
Gilneans with dual forms can turn back to their human form because of the Scythe. I’m not entirely sure that other races can catch the ‘Curse’, though. The original ‘worgen’ are druids who abandoned their elven form and became feral, for that they were banished to the Dream. It could be possible for other races to turn into worgen, but it’s unlikely. (Also, Forsaken cannot turn because the curse and the plague of undeath exclude one another)
---
Is that fur...? Coming out of your ears?
---
18/18 league member here..
---
 *🎵* *Just gonna stand there and end your turn* *🎵*
---
Yeah, there's a reason I don't play wild. One is the Big Priest, one is that I don't have many Wild cards and the other is that I dislike the power level.
---
No
---
So by the looks of it, you made a worse big shaman?  Seems literally just like more big minions slapped it, ruining barnes pull pool. And cards like faceless mean you can't play cards like ancestors call or eureka without playing the faceless from hand, unless you want to get bad value.
---
Adding to this, Worgen are immune to Curse of Undeath, meaning they can't be returned as undead after they die. I think it's safe to assume undead are also immune to Worgen Curse.
---
Generally speaking, the minion +1/+1 anomaly with evolve hero power...
---
I completely agree. Board flood was already one of the hardest strategies to pull off. Big minions has always been one of the easier ones. Having the fruit carts there just isn't fun.
---
From WoW character creation screen it has to be goblin.
---
I've done a LOT of research into this. The best answer I have is; no. Humans and Night Elves are the only two races that can catch the Worgen affliction. This is due to the experiments of Arugal.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Worgen originated as a druidic form gone bad, which then became a spreadable plague. When Arugal discovered the Worgen sleeping in the Emerald Dream (put there by Malfurion as punishment, complacency was torture to the ravenous hunters), he wanted to use them as a way to fight the Undead Scourge. Originally, Genn Greymane wouldn't allow it. Arugal did a ton of testing on them, and this is where he made it so that humans could contract the plague. Then, when the undead were threatening to break down the door to Gilneas, Genn finally gave the green light to release them. They did their job, but also turned on the Gilneans helping them. The guilt drove Arugal insane, and then from there he becomes the villain we know him as.
---
I could be completely wrong, but I believe that this explains why it's only two known races. Technically if a worgen bit a Night Elf, they'd turn. If I'm wrong, I'd love to be corrected on this.
---
TL;DR: No, because it started with night elves, but Arugal did some fancy experiments that allowed it to spread to Humans.

I agree he is one of the easier final bosses but he can tempo out if he pulls out some good deathrattles early. Also got hit by a 1/1 ragnaros turn 1 and that was probably one of the worse turns he had.

12-1
---
Kinda. Arugul pulled the original night elven worgen out of the emerald dream, but they escaped and went ham on everything.
---
Wow, congrats
---
There is a plugin for Deck Tracker that does exactly that.
---
Adding multiple copies of a buffed version from Bob adds the basic card not the buffed versions. Likely you only drew the buffed version on the first game, and regulars after.
---
If you add a minion to your deck with +1/+1, it doesn't affect other copies of it. You can have a buffed ragnaros and an unbuffed one for example.
---
They need to add a new column to the Player table in the database, like "IsAutoSquelched" and make it 0 or 1, then they need to add a button in options for you to switch it from 0 to 1 or vice versa. At the start of every game, the game checks the database for that column, squelches the opponent if that IsAutoSquelched for you is 1. Thats it.
---
Locked for gold. Sorry bud
---
I know, but I prefer this way personally. In fact I never noticed that note until I looked up the sheet music.
---
Since you have Hagatha the Witch you could make a pretty good murloc deck since they're cheap (dustwise) and you get extra value from Hagatha passive. I've seen Kibler play a murloc deck with Hagatha and it seems pretty strong imo.
---
There's a bombs in DawN's deck, and there's corrupted bloods in both decks.
---
There were multiple turns in a row where both could have just died to a bad draw.
---
&gt; Gonking
---
Sounds like a euphemism.
---
After Tyler didn't draw a Corrupted Blood on this turn, he's now praying that DawN will draw one, and DawN is praying for the opposite.
---
I use them only to find absolute pitch height for the first few notes, so I doubt if you can find other versions that are similar to mine.
---
Context: There is a couple of Hakkar's blood in their decks. Since there is no way knowing who's gonna draw the blood first, they are literally praying.
---
Druid is easy. Auctioneer, Jade idol, ramp, and a bunch of 1-2 cost minions. All the minions will be destroyed, ramp until you can throw down a bunch of Jade's.
---
Yup, I did. I looked at the hearthstone forums, and apparently tonnes of other people have this problem too :(, kinda sucks.
---
I played against him and he did nothing but resurrect his bag of coins, a total of 12 times without every playing anything with offensive capabilities. Easiest boss I have ever faced playing heroic
---
I'll find a time to give it a try. If you feel that you've waited too long you can notify me here as well.
---
You're talking about the banker dude that has a hero power that returns his minions to hand and buffs them.  /u/KrevanSerKay is talking about a different one (who i think can only show up later than encounter 6) with a hero power that reveals a card from deck, gives it +4/+4, and puts it on top.
---
I think it's a passive after rounds 1 and 5, an active treasure after rounds 3 and 7. If the pattern holds, it's another passive after 9, another active after 11. Friendly encounters are after 3 and 5, so no idea how that extrapolates with 4 more bosses.

---
&gt; They have turned into a card that will never change.  
---
  
---
Until it transforms in to a different card.
---
I'm not the right guy to ask, but I have seen a lot of people on here say to craft Whizbang if you're f2p and new. It's always that answer, or budget mid-range Hunter from what I've seen. So my guess is yes, it's possible by rank 25 due to quests and maybe even dusting. Also, I did see someone post on here that they made a f2p account and reached legend in a month or something with token druid.
---
Beat each chapter with every class, every hero power, every deck, and every combination thereof.
---
In theory you should be able ti play around him by playing low costo minions on the left so that those switch ti him at the end of the turn. 
---
Otherwise yeah he can be pretty obnoxious
---
I mean, the game literally tells you to "cheat". The whole idea is built around building a broken set of combos.
---
i think the rotation direction changes, but the number of minions on each side doesn't. So in theory you should just swarm the board and try not to give him deathrattles/passive effects.
---
Of all posts I could have made this mistake on...
---
Try reinstalling the app if this continues.
---
No, it doesn't. Rocket Boots gives all minions rush, so it's drawing a rush minion by definition.

Because this isn't a post about constructed, and OP was just making a joke about big priest. You whooshed and made a serious comment on a silly post.

that’s not at all what he said. his example was completely right and you’re ignoring it.
---
Imho orginal rumble runs were to frustrating, like are you telling me you were able to 1-2 shot them before rebalance? Because attempting the same run more than 5 times if you are good player, hoping that this time you will be able to prevail turn 8 (most of the times) tempo swing of final boss is not my idea of fun or skill.

That's what he gets for playing Mecha'thun.
---
Definitely Sneed’s, but I don’t think he has any of the others. Nearly decked him out when I was fooling around and most of the cards were just mechs.
---
Explanation: got the 3 Mana reduction on unstable evolution and the 3 Dr boom bots spawning relic. Evolved the bots and one turned into that 6 Mana rock that summons minions equal cost to the spells u use
---
Btw had to ensure that lethal with the 41/41 gIvE Me a qUeST
---
played first the card giving me an extra turn, then the guy casted it again and i completed my quest and played it. after my 3 Turns my opponent had 1 turn, then again me and then he got his two turns. yeah had lethal with Antonidas but wanted to see how this goes on and killed him after he made his two turns :)
---
still wish lord marrowgar was a legendary
---
 Fucking awesome art! Please keep posting here!

Here's my card idea:
---
No, I’m pretty sure this is a popular opinion. I wanted to make this post last week but was not looking forward to all the 12-14 year olds backlash.
---
That bitch deserved it.
---
It was the same run boss 1 and 2
---
I just finished a run where i shuffled fuegan multiple times and shuffled that 3 cost heal 3 nuetral and just kept drawing them for the rest of the game very sad and disappointing run

---
Imo, a lot of people were imaging a completely different use than what it ended up being, I’m pretty sure the majority of waggle pick play was around bouncing charge minions for lethal, a lot of people were obsessed with some kind of controlly value based rogue at that moment.
---
Nobody cares bro
---
I think I reached peak Pogo.  
---
1) My left-most card is always discounted by 2 (Emerald Goggles).  
---
2) I always start with Brann in my hand (bar encounter benefit).  
---
3) The rest of my deck is Pogo Hoppers (via  Duplatransmogrifier).  
---
4) I draw 2 extra cards every turn, and cannot die from fatigue (Elixir of Vim).

Yeah, it might go into "other functionality" in the EULA but the plugin has been around for years and I havent heard anyone getting banned for it to date at least.

Would be nice to have a comment from blizzard about it.
---
Feel free to edit them
---
&gt; FWIW - WoTC is on record as saying that they would employ true randomness if MTG was a purely digital game. They've done this with a digital only set once a long time ago, too.
---
There are benefits to both approaches. Mark Rosewater (lead designer of MtG) has also said that players [hate the appearance of randomness](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/kind-acts-randomness-2009-05-04) much more than they hate randomness itself. He explains further:
---
&gt;My point in this section is that according to our market research players consistently have rejected game elements that they feel are random.
---
The entire article is an interesting read on how Magic has started to approach randomness since the first few Un-sets, but the important take-aways are:
---
#1) Make randomness lead to upside.  
---
#2) Give players the chance to respond to randomness.  
---
#3) Allow players to manipulate the source of the randomness.  
---
#4) Avoid icons of randomness.  
---
That's not to say that they might not use "totally random" things, but when doing so I would expect them to adhere to these principles while doing so. I think that they have (largely) done this in the past, and Magic is a great game because of it.
---
NOOOOOOOOO!
---
I don’t know if it’s less interesting, but it’s certainly not uninteresting. Magnetic, echo, deathrattle, mech, legendary. There’s a lot there that could be used for different purposes in different decks.
---
Kylael#2476 lf 80g quest trade on EU, I'll show my quest then we do yours first.
---
Technically speaking this is draw RNG, which is in every CCG.
---
Yes we do. Just ones that actually deserve it.
---
That logic is straight up flawed. They should let people learn mechanics in their collection, not force people into games with cards that have no explanation. Many new sets introduce keywords. They're being lazy.
---
Mecha thun priest was tier 3 across multiple sites..
---
I don't think there are many people who play test hearthstone. Maybe 10-20. Sure, they should look at broken interactions first, but if the card was added last week, they didn't have much time to think about it. I'm pretty sure that is why they released it to the public almost 2 weeks before adding it to the game, so that the public could come up with broken interactions for the card. Let us all just be happy that they added a new card in between set releases, and be happy they displayed it in time for someone to catch a game breaking interaction before the release of the card.
---
So is Heroic.
---
I'm not concerned with it. Wild's power level is absurd, and getting a copy of mechwarper to get the 3 cost reduction is kinda slow.
---
For example, we can already Glinda Mechwarper Mechwarper Mechwarper Mechwarper Mechwarper Warbot Warbot warbot warbot warbot... on 9 mana with 3 cards. Replacing Glinda with Zola for example requires you to hold BOTH mechwarpers and Snip, meaning you go from a 2 card (+any 1 magnetic) to a 4 specific card combo for 3 less mana.
---
The problem there being Mechs are pretty good at aggro, aggro can float 2 dead cards, floating 4 isn't cool, and you still have to stick a mech, because even if you play a 300000/300000 it dies because people tech vs big priest.
---
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Tuesday evening I created an F2P account for the fun of it. The next morning I had a full-on Bomb Hunter.
---
Just 1 legendary should be easy.
---
It makes no difference (other than normal mode is easier so you will get the cardback sooner that way) but I personally am beating everything on normal mode first.
---
There is a way to make it 0 mana in Wild on every class that people found, and it's a reasonable one. They simply didn't find the absurd one.
---
But if we assume this card was revealed to the play testers a week before they went public, they didn't really have a lot of time to come up with broken interactions. It's probably why they went public with it 2 weeks before release, to get the public's input.
---
The amount of people that are angry that this interaction slipped through the cracks boggles my mind. The fact that the devs took the time to read community feedback and fix a problem that hadn't even reached the playbase is absolutely amazing and should be praised. This is so far from industry standards that I'm shocked it happened at all!
---
People get bored or literally everything.
---
Once a deck is played by anyone except themselves it becomes a "shitty netdeck" and is a boring and uninteresting metadeck. Even if the deck is garbage and also hasn't existed for a day.
---
People were complaining about Bomb Warrior literally 3 hours after Dalaran came out.
---
Play testers? How about card designers?
---
You clearly care enough to make this post.
---
Quite. The more 'indie' card games like Shadowverse and Eternal will offer you more free progression, some others like MTG and Artifact less. For a game on the scale of Hearthstone it's very reasonable. 
---
An experienced player could take a fresh account to Legend in days.
---
With those decks I focus more on fun/meme potential than making a deck that's actually good, so the greed doesn't bother me. Filling a Jade Druid/Exodia Mage/Reno deck with unplayable Weasels is so satisfying.
---
I tried out a version of the deck with the Hostage Priest package with Spirit of the Dead, but it just didn't work and went back to Benedictus. I've been experimenting with Barista Lynchen, but I've had a much higher WR with Greater Healing Potion instead. 
---
And if you didn't know already, Shadowy Figure doesn't count towards the quest so keep that in mind. I almost always save the Shadowy Figures for Cube unless I desperately need another Dead Ringer/Loot Hoarder to complete the quest.

NOBODY CARES
---
Well, tier 3 isn't what most people would check first. I knew of the Mecha'thun Priest, and what the combo pieces was, but I still didn't think of the interaction between the new legendary and Reckless Experimenter until someone on reddit said that it was possible.
---
&gt; These guys have been working on this game for years, nevermind the vast level of experience they have with other card games
---
You seem to hold video game workers to unreasonably high standards. A lot of them are like you and me, working in the fields for a couple years, doing a good enough job to keep their job, but not good enough to warrant extraordinary mentions.
---
And my point was more that people expect unreasonable amount of efficiency coming from a testing team. I drew a parallel where 1 million people working for 20 minutes is as much time as 450 people working nonstop for 30 years. If you account for breaks and whatnot, it's a lot closer to 120 years. And HS' QA team definitely isn't 450-people strong, it's probably closer to 25, so we're now shooting for 2000 years. That's why when people say "OMFG, how could they not find the interaction in a *whole month* when a new LoL/DotA/HS/PoE/etc. patch land, I'm always bemused.
---
Damn this theoretical future sure is disappointing, darn.
---
Having it land on a random one drop also feels pretty bad. Isn't that buff called "Take a Chance"?
---
I am a big OTK player, miracle mecha'Thun druid is my favorite deck of all time, but a 2 card combo that kills someone if you have any mech on board on turn 5+ is broken, especially because you can tutor the legendary
---
&gt; People get bored or literally everything.
---
Yup.
---
Which is why I specifically said that people got bored of Shudderwock really really quickly. Because them getting bored isn't anything special.
---
Them getting bored of an uninteractive combo that took sometimes literally minutes to complete *really quickly* is something to note, however.
---
&gt; Once a deck is played by anyone except themselves it becomes a "shitty netdeck"
---
Maybe. But that's not what I said at all. People in general get tired of combo decks that gain a lot of traction in a short amount of time.
---
For the notable reason that they end up getting combo'd. And what does a combo entail in a card game?
---
Uninteractivity.
---
Which isn't particularly fun, generally speaking.
---
&gt; Even if the deck is garbage and also hasn't existed for a day.
---
A deck doesn't have to be effective or powerful to be boring. If it is  being played *enough,* it can be annoying or boring regardless.
---
Look man, I shouldn't have to defend the general /r/hearthstone hivemind. I'm usually against it. But what I said was a very common sense statement that even I can't deny.
---
Why are you trying to go against the grain so hard here?
---
&gt; People were complaining about Bomb Warrior literally 3 hours after Dalaran came out.
---
And?
---
Looks like they had a point, considering Elysiana got nerfed for what Kibler speculates to be purely logistical reasons.
---
It’s still sad that players had to point out this combo. The game designers forgot about a card they only made a year ago. And it’s in the same set they are buffing.
---
A card designers' job is to make a card with a cool/interesting effect. It's the play tester's job to tell the designers that it would break the game.
---
Yw
---
Yes, once during a heist and (now) 3 times in reddit ;)
---
You wouldn't play devilsaur egg or voodoo doll for 1?
---
Blizzard devs becoming better!!! Excited
---
Upset people making impulsive decisions to buy packs to change their decks when they get tilted with emotes. That's why emotes exist and get forced into you.
---
Indeed, I pointed that out in my next comment, saying it took literally minutes for the Shudderwock Combo to finish.
---
That said, it should go without saying that dying to Lifedrinker and duplications of Shudderwock over and over gets boring, regardless of animations.
---
Not really no, the reckless experimenter would ever bring it's cost down to 0 unless you manage to bring in so much mana cheating you would've won anyways.
---
I believe it was hotfixed and the nerfs have happened so a patch isn’t required. The next patch is due June 3rd for the mech event.
---
Obviously the fucking issue is being handled. Show me where it states that if you pay to rent a license on a video game, that you're entitled to have the company give you whatever details you demand if said product has any flaws just like every other game out there. They don't have to do shit. You're the fucking knuckle dragger. They can shutdown their entire network of servers and pull the plug on hearth and there's not a damn thing you or anyone can do about it. That's what you fucking agreed to and if you don't like it, don't fucking play their game
---
&gt; I would be too many sets behind and need to craft a good amount of cards for a tier 1 deck. 
---
Crafting a deck in wild is the same as crafting a deck in standard, still 30 cards. :P
---
The benefit of wild is that your cards have permanence.
---
IMO, a F2P shouldn't jump straight into wild, they should play standard, and the second their collection rotates, stay in wild. Over the long run, wild is far far far more efficient, and the sooner you get in, the sooner you can benefit from that efficiency, because standard will always have Infinite Upkeep, and Wild will always have Finite Catchup.
---
That's hardly a mistake unless you only have unidentified... it's just bad luck lol.
---
Please tell me what deck had a winning condition involving Reckless Experiment and a 3 or less mana deathrattle? Because other than that, I don't see how this "nerf" killed the decks running Reckless Experiment
---
Those nerfs and buffs illustrate something well: 1 mana cost increase/decrease is not insignificant. There's a huge difference between 0 mana and 1 mana, in fact, bigger than between 8 and 9, percentage-wise. Being unable to play everything you need on turn 5 for 0 mana is a big deal.
---
Makes the games fun and not repetitive. The mechanic will never go away
---
And why doesnt it say draw a card
---
If you’re against a lot of shaman, it sounds like a great tech!
---
? how does priest do the mecha'thun combo involving reckless experimenter after this nerf? isn't it 1 mana too much now?
---
Hey Chaotic_Gold, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "PSA". Titles should be phrased with an informative, declarative statement that can stand on its own without the use of "PSA".

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/hearthstone) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
I'm gonna say it.
---
It ruins my wild deathrattle otk priest, but that deck is the worst semi-serious deck I've ever played so no big loss there.
---
Yeah, token Druid is tough.  You can sometimes win with a hyena, and if you do manage to get a rusher dire frenzy’s and then draw a masters call, you usually win.
---
They know what the cards do. But the number of combinations of cards is staggering, and they don’t have infinite time.
---
Did you spot the interaction yourself? Because if not, you’re acting on being told the interaction would be OP and go ”yeah, ofc it is” pretending it’s the first thing that came to everyone’s mind.
---
It being ”their job” does not magically make them have more man-hours of interaction checking. With the vast amount of people here, it’s a certainty that we will spot broken combos a lot more often than the developers.
---
Also, what on earth does it matter? Get over it.
---
Gonna be at least three more weeks due to the last two chapters releasing over the next two weeks.
---
I was wondering for the last week why they changed the picture. Now I realise they changed the name too!
---
HappyBro#2392 EU 80g Trade Quest
---
How about change all cards like these to cant be reduced under 1 and only keep specific 0 mana cards?
---
That’s probably pretty good.  Hunting Party is really primarily a tech against control hunter.  It’s issueless against everything else.  Well, it’s goof against control shaman and OTK Paladin, too.
---
Did you even read the pinned post?
---
&gt;We’re also aware of some interactions that SN1P-SN4P creates in Wild when played alongside multiple copies of Mechwarper. We’ll be keeping a close eye on how that plays out over the following weeks.
---
Tried it, four losses in a row. Buzzard instadied every time. Rank 12-&gt;13 was the result. Not even a slight winning chance. But the game is infested with warriors and druids these days. Ain't got a snowball chance in hell against lucky druid or lucky warrior.
---
haha, That's fine. I get that a lot now since I only ever play Wild, I try to avoid talking about standard balance now since I often say shit like "Why don't you just play Quartermaster?" because I forget those core class cards aren't in the core set.
---
What card is out of rotation?
---
It sure will be after the balance changes.
---
The voice actress really does a spectacular job of selling it.
---
Whereas I got 240 gold and a crappy golden rare for my 12 win run, feelsbadman.
---
I think it will actually. I believe there's a mechathun deck that works by pulling the mechathun from hand with a different minions deathrattle and killing it with ticking abominations or whatever that cards called
---
You wanna elaborate on that?
---
Or were any of the 8 dk hero powers game winning with the exception of shaman?

If it doesn't say "created by", he drafted it.
