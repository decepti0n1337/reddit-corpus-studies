&gt;You don't get arrested for dressing like old Jaina.

---
That isn't what he said.
---
In light of the nerf to wild growth, nourish, and innervate, I think the changes to lore and keeper could be examined again. Those were made specifically with the idea of keeping ramp intact 
---
41, damn star inflation is real
---
It was given to random players and then they spread it
---
...you...you really dont remember all the anger about odd and even Paladin recently? I'll give you it's not as bad as hunter but pally has been oppressing for awhile.
---
And even that aside, all the bitching has been about hunter which they just nerfed, so they are obviously looking.
---
No, most of those sources are what gamergate didnt like, so the sources are biased against it.

---
You make online games.
---
How can you NOT BE aware of the Streisand effect?
---
You DO realize that Jaina's boobs have received more attention in the last couple of days than the 5 years the game has been out, right?
---
Anyway, thank you for giving me some time of my day back.
---
There‚Äôs a difference between Jaina missing an Undershirt and a game like Force of Will. One of these games has female characters who, yes, have breasts, big deal. The other game has such a focus on the hypersexualization of women that, since I don‚Äôt know the names of any of the cards, refer to the cards as ‚Äúhentai chick,‚Äù or ‚Äúmiss
---
Lifts her legs up too high,‚Äù or my favorite ‚Äúhigh queen big tits.‚Äù
---
I don‚Äôt care if Jaina wears an undershirt, but it‚Äôs crazy to think that her original state was some attempt to make her deliberately sexy.
---
Oh so you‚Äôre just a straight up bad person, glad we got that settled.
---

---
The nerf to hunter did fuck all so they aren‚Äôt listening.
---
It‚Äôs like moaning about a cars performance to a company and then coming back with changing the colour!
---
Finally I meet someone with worse Legend pulls then me. Thank you for making this player, who had to dust DK Garrosh, Clutchmother, Lady in White and Cho to make Whizbang, feel better.
---
I've since pulled Zillax, Kangor and Endless Army but for a month or two there I was certain my RNG had decided to give up on me and go to the pub instead.
---
(I was also awarded Gonk as my free Rumble Legend, but I pulled Rhino too, so maybe my luck is starting to turn a little - I'm 3 packs away from the 70 pack pity timers on Witch, Boom and Rumble so let's see what I get next)
---
Few random players started with it, and went to spread the infection.
---
How much did Blizzard pay you?
---
He's a good ladder grinder but a bad tournament player. He's on the same team as ShtanUdachi though. 
---
Paladin was like the second most played class after hunter and the class with possibly the most archetypes.
---
$10 says he just crafted those for the karma.
---
Hah good one.
---
In fact, I pay th√©m to play!
---
Hearthstone Deck Tracker can also show you a timer in a windows.  
---
you can have it in the foreground of any other game or internet page 
---
That is precisely correct. 
---
Funny how you didn't comment this on any of the positive comments. ü§î
---
Yes, I do have 1000's of dust I am not using. The point is there is nothing I want to use it on at the moment! What I am trying to say is unless you want to spend the dust then there is no point in liquidating your cards into currency (dust) as by keeping them in stocks (card form) you have a chance to earn more and no chance to lose! Except in the extremely unlikely circumstance that Blizzard makes dust refunds more stingey.  
---
So for example if I have 4x biology project I already have that extra dust from the spare 2. If I keep it in card form then those 2 cards could potentially be worth full refund value if it is ever nerfed but if I do need the dust now to craft a new legendary or whatever then you can just do it when you need to craft it. No point having liquid dust in your collection. Am I starting to make sense yet?
---
The last time I tried it, the leader was corrupted in-game. So it didn‚Äôt work. The subreddit wasn‚Äôt too helpful. The last update on this was a year ago. 
---
It's so we all get Valentine's gifts this year.
---
A witch!!
---
or just because the set contains cards that support the classic set archetype instead of driving the archetype in either a new direction or just coming up with a new wincon. like how spellstone made the jank that was secret hunter with cloaked huntress and putricide into an actual deck. look at counterfeit coin as a card. it was used in the MSoG miracle but the wincon was again leeroy coldblood/ malygos/leeroy faceless aka not anything new. the set philosophy should also be changed if trying out a new archetype make sure they have something relevant at the end of the year so that we play with that instead of the same old thing we are playing with 
---
Thank you for not denying it and also "them" doesn't have an accent over the letter e.
---
Because it's not piecemeal but by groups. Cards would be internally labelled by  theme. 
---
There are 15 classic cards for each class currently. By focusing on indentity and theme, you know Mage has 5 Fire cards, 5 Ice Cards, and 5 Secret cards in Classic and you can add 5 Classic Elementals by swapping out 5 Ice cards. Then in 2 years, you can add the Ice cards back in.
---
freetoplay btw
---
How does a little bit of cleavage even amount to this comment lmao, it‚Äôs not like every second card has giant tits. Lmao this is sad.
---
False equivalence 
---
It's poking fun at Blizzard playing the public decency police, cracking down on any perceived immorality by changing artworks no one would have really cared about.
---
They are probably doing it to keep the game running in China or something.
---
I couldn't even tell the first time the comparison pics came out what changed
---
Whenever a card gets nerfed, no matter how tiny it is, people abandon the class until some streamer makes a new meta deck. 
---
Second most played here‚Äôs a pie let‚Äôs cut it up into potions give hunter 60% of that, paladin 20% of that and then divide the rest of among the rest, 2nd most played yeh, that‚Äôs a great way to look at it...
---
You sound smug and uncreative, friend.
---
Neither did anyone when they tried to ‚Äúfix‚Äù Tess too. That‚Äôs the problem. 
---
Wee sorry my post shows that to be wrong, hunter has increased and even spell hunter doesn‚Äôt seemed bothered by nerfs.
---
It‚Äôs done fuck all to them and just drove more to playing the class.
---
You also sound upset, friendo. 
---
i didnt read the title sorry 
---
I don't know much about erotic fiction (if you asked me, I'd have said that those book covers were of male homoerotica but sure) so I went and checked those authors to see if it's a pattern. And yeah, it's not. Those book covers seem to have been cherry-picked to make a point, and I'd rather have something more conclusive than that. 
---
...okay. I'll bite. What should they, with their mountains of data and desire to keep a customer base that pays them, have nerfed instead?
---
Good ol equality, average sized boobs are not ok, but muscles so large that even if you downed 30 bottles of steroids a day and worked out every day you would never attain like malf garrosh thrall are totally fine. Not to mention being that big would kill you by 40.
---
I don't think the people who complain about this kind of stuff know what equality means.
---
I made an edit on that concept lmao
---
Finally the technology became available
---
Very good question, I would assume not since the minion wouldn‚Äôt inherently always have charge thus may not be classified as a charge minion, but it‚Äôs not like you slapped charge on it directly from a different card as is the warsong case. it would be cool if it did get buffed while you‚Äôre armed, time to play test it (can someone do it for me I‚Äôm f2p hscirclejerk and can‚Äôt afford warsong)
---
Never been to legend rank, but honestly, I don't see the point of going farther once you hit rank 5. 
---
The end of the season rewards beyond rank 5 aren't any better, and the legendary card back is really ugly in my opinion.
---
Yeah, he is actually a half orc/half ogre (which is called mok'nathal). [Here](https://i.imgur.com/T6trrBS.png) he is without the mask.
---
The phrase "If you don't do it, someone else will" is ridiculous. What is that supposed to mean? That we should? One would assume that whether or not we do it (in this case idolize) should have absolutely no impact on whether other people are going to do it. So no, just because "if you don't do it, someone else will" doesn't mean you should. 
---
As an extreme example, if I had a button hooked up to a nuke and sat in a public place and said if you don't press it someone else will, would you press it? No! You'd call the police!!

---
I'm with you on that. I want more new arenas. I want it to be the weekend maybe or on Sundays only. Or maybe you can choose a Wild or Standard arena.

---
Anything not rotating out soon? 
---
Starts in your hand honestly sounds good, lines up with how quests were balanced but you can take advantage of hp immediately instead of staking out for a massive quest reward. I‚Äôve always loved hero power upgrades /manipulation so it would be cool to see more so long as nothing limits design space. 
---
I played without Alex for a while, and then after playing her I realized how big the difference is. The best replacement would be Velen if you have him, and Mind Control IMO if you don‚Äôt.

Hey now, Shadowform can make a solid Shadow Priest meme deck.

I'm surprised that the comments on this thread are all so negative. I think this is an extremely helpful analogy for imagining part of what being a woman is like in many modern games. Cheers to you OP.

&gt;a powerful basic/ classic set instead makes the archetypes fixed.
---
Token Druid, Big Druid, Taunt Druid, and Maly/Waggle Druid were four distinct archetypes that mostly shared the 15+ card Druid Core (which was mostly expansion cards anyway).  The frustrating part of it was that, since all four archetypes shared so many cards, you often didn't know which of them you were playing against until turn 6+.  So you would often make bad decisions based on not knowing if you were playing against a midrange deck or a combo deck.

For players that started in Witchwood, bringing back cards from the Ungoro version of the Classic set would feel fresh.
---
Nerfs also drive up the cost of the game.  That isn't an argument for or against nerfing or a rotating set, it's something team5 will have to deal with either way.

---
Good
---
Use the tier list, druid is top rn IIRC. 
---
They could undo nerfs if they felt it appropriate. That alone undoes most of the need for a rotating set. Even if it is sort of like a rotation. 
---
It also sounds like you have a greater hope for rotation than would happen. Do you really think half the classic set would rotate? That‚Äôs an unreasonable expectation. Rotate into what other cards?
---
How do people obtain those cards? What happens to all the players who collections you just gimped?
---
‚ÄúOh, just wait it out a year or two and maybe they‚Äôll be playable again‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to cut it for a f2p game. 
---
Adding old cards back isn‚Äôt the same as adding new cards in. 
---
There‚Äôs a lot more to say here, but I‚Äôll stick to this:
---
What‚Äôs the guarantee this makes the game better for the long term? The assumption here seems to be that everything works out for the best and I have a lot of doubts they get this right. 
---
‚ÄúWorld 1: malygos is here forever and causes design restrictions (current world). We can agree that this world is bad.‚Äù
---
See? We already don‚Äôt agree that removing malygos is for the best. Now multiply that times 100 and roll it out to tens of millions of players each yeah. 
---
I‚Äôm not buying that this is a fool proof plan 
---
I fully agree with using her updated model for a new portrait instead of this... but the coverup is in no way off model, it's the shirt she was wearing underneath extended above the tittywindow.
---
could be a shop, if so good for you. 
---
It annoys me as a semi free to play person. I wish there was a "dust all non gold cards" button. 
---
I don't want to spend time dusting certain cards and not dusting others. If I do that then they win. 
---
You have probably already made your Choice as many suggested Druid. If not, I would actually go for Warrior. If you have, this is for next time.
---
If I'm not mistaken, it's one of the (currently) top classes in arena with hunter (maybe it's rogue) and warlock. With a good number of clears and cards that can generate multiple minions, it's not a bad choice. I have done man runs of Warrior that end in ~7+ wins. I like to draft a minimum of 2 war paths, executes, add 2 dragons, 4 damage to damaged minions. Brawl rarely shows up, but I always take it. It's a good card. Very few weapons. Mechs and Dragon synergy is good but not everything. If you get the add 2 then that should be enough if you have 1-2 other dragons.
---
6 wins isn't bad. As an average that's great, but if it's your once in a blue moon max run then you just need to try more. Learn the value of cards, force opponents to make "bad" trades, know when to defend, and when be aggressive or go face.
---

Patience! I consider my lack of patience a virtue for myself.
---
I like dusting to create new cards so I can play new decks. I need to have new decks constantly and play new things. C'est la vie, whatever will be will be, to each his own, etcetera. (refuse to google how that is spelled, don't have the patience.)
---
I mean, as a company, granted. But for a simple search like "Winnie the Pooh China", is there any danger?
---
Did explosive trap trigger and kill your minion first? If so, secrets trigger in the order that they are played. So if along the line the minion died before the final secret could have been triggered then it wouldn‚Äôt trigger because there was no minion to bounce back. 
---
This is why I still hold onto my golden Preparations. 
---
Well this is consistent with their other wording inconsistencies. 
---
The breasts size is the same. 
---
1/3's without text see play in Rogue and Paladin.  They never saw play in aggro Mage, and still don't unless it's Odd Mage.
---
&gt;This is why it‚Äôs hard to assume rotations are always good because everyone will agree on what should stay and go
---
1) Rotations aren't a silver bullet, it's not like they are automatically good.  Team5 needs to be a competent design team for it to be so.  But if they aren't a competent design team, then there's no hope for the game anyway.
---
2) As much as people might not agree on what should stay or go, I think most people could agree that not everything should go, which appears to be the current strategy: nerf everything, take it all out.
---
Barnes is why everyone hates Priest in Wild. It should have gotten nerfed a long time ago. 
---
&gt; no reason at all?
---
Maybe it was put into play by another source and not played.
---
The best players in any card game, Hearthstone including, will tend to be those very much willing to take smart risks. Diamond Spellstone, Zerek's Cloning Gallery, and Eternal Servitude are sources of a lot of smart risks.
---
Decks in other card games like Modern Black/Red Hollow One from MtG is another great example.
---
Undoing nerfs and redoing nerfs all the time gets confusing. Might as well rotate.
---
Rotating a fourth or maybe even a third would be fine without replacement. Or you can rotate half and add some old cards.
---
I mean, wouldn‚Äôt that be cool if dirty rat came back every now and then? or old dr. Boom in a new meta? or only 2 death knights were rotated in, but not the rest? You can use your old cards. If you‚Äôre new you can open them from core packs, or buy the old packs on the site.
---
True, it kinda sucks for people who only have classic cards, but what about people who have a lot of expansion cards? Their collection gets ‚Äúgimped‚Äù after a normal rotation. Those people might actually get help if for example dk valeera is added to the core set next year instead of rotating. And if anyone refuses to get new cards, they can just play wild or arena.
---
Meta wise, adding back old cards IS the same as adding new cards. It‚Äôs not as exciting, and they still print new cards too. Like when stormwind champion was ‚Äúadded‚Äù  to the meta that felt fresh for a time.
---
What makes rotating better long term? Well either
---
1: the classic set is powerful forever decks are the same and boring. Druid just plays wild growth and nourish and ramps until the end of time.
---
2: the classic set is nerfed to the ground. people only play expansion cards and the evergreen set might as well be deleted.
---
3: the core set rotates and things constantly change. keeps things interesting. Sure they can still screw this up, but at least things will change again.
---
Okay so you think malygos should stay in the game until the end of time? Well I think that would get old after a while. You can always play malygos when it‚Äôs in rotation or in wild. I don‚Äôt think forcing people who hate malygos to have to deal with it forever is the right move.
---
But since malygos hasn‚Äôt been touched, let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs perfect and let‚Äôs talk about something that has been changed. Wild growth.
---
Before every non Aggro deck always ran wild growth and nourish forever. Boring right? That‚Äôs why they nerfed it. But now you can‚Äôt really run ramp anymore. At least not the version that once existed. Not even in wild. Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to preserve the ramp deck archetype but not have it be around always and forever?
---
Now I‚Äôm not saying they should never nerf classic cards. Like Leeroy at 4 was obviously broken. It‚Äôs not foolproof, but a rotating core set can be used as another tool to keep things interesting in addition to nerfs and expansion releases. 
---
Come join us in Wild before you go. 
---
I'll go against the grain and say loatheb is worse than dirty rat. Loatheb is just too good for an aggro deck and had almost no down side.
---
Dirty tech is indeed dirty against OTK but it backfires a fair amount of time against other decks. 
---
I don't think there's any logic to it. Jaraxxus is just coded to die to Sacrificial Pact because the devs thought it would be funny when the first made the game. 
---
&gt; It also sounds like you have a greater hope for rotation than would happen. Do you really think half the classic set would rotate? That‚Äôs an unreasonable expectation. Rotate into what other cards? How do people obtain those cards? What happens to all the players who collections you just gimped?
---
My impression is that the people talking about a rotating core set are, indeed, meaning a rotation of that order of magnitude.  (My personal expectation was more along the lines of a third, but I could certainly see a half.)  So when you make an argument based on a (relative) handful of cards being rotated, you're really not addressing the situation that is being advocated for (as I understand it).
---
I think such a rotation certainly has issues, especially with respect to players' collections as you mention, and I'd like to see a discussion of that specific point.  To address your other possibly-rhetorical questions, my instinctive answers are: Rotation into other wild cards (possibly newly-wild, triggered by the rotation), augmented with some completely new cards.  Cards entering rotation are obtained from new classic packs, crafted, or already possessed if the user had the other versions.
---
&gt;Jerry
---
I am definitely referring to Jaraxxus as "Jerry" from now on. 
---
I said worth defending, not speaking out against. Blizzard made a decision (a good one imo) about their game and you &amp; others on this sub are acting like it‚Äôs some kind of crime orchestrated by SJWs. Over unnecessary cleavage. Like, grow up.

It has anti synergy with a call to arms which could pull it.  You don‚Äôt want to run the 5/4 version cause it‚Äôs too slow.  The 3/2, 2 mana version will get pulled with call to arms.
---
I forgot that card even exist
---
How would you nerf it?
---
I think we generally need to accept that there is no solution that will please everyone, that changes to the classic set seem to last forever despite their impact only bringing benefits for a short time, and that (I think) the game is likely to be made worse than improved by these changes over time. 
---
The dream
---
Calling it now, Blizzard will shut this down for making them look bad.
---
Just like hunter hero power, you can cast it but it won‚Äôt deal damage.
---
Adam Levine inspired
---
Yeah I get the same bug
---
How did he get that one lossy is what I‚Äôm wondering
---
&gt; The point isn't freshness IMO. It's entirely about not permanently removing cards when those cards are only problematic for a limited time with specific sets
---
That's what I think many people have in mind. The idea that rotation will fix the issues because it can remove problems without upsetting anyone. That we get our cake and eat it too. 
---
I also think if Malygos (or just about any card) got rotated out, back in, and then caused *any* problem the development team wouldn't hear the end of it. I bet they wouldn't hear the end of it even in advance of any problems being caused. 
---
That and I don't believe you can tell budget or casual players, "Don't worry, these changes only affect you for at least a year; maybe longer if we decide to not rotate cards back in. Just be patient'
---
&gt;Expectations can be managed
---
It's hard to manage the expectations of 10s of millions players effectively when they all want different things. Better to not create them
---
&gt;That sounds like an argument in favor of avoiding changes to the evergreen set by letting cards be temporarily rotated out but then rotated back in later, as opposed the the alternative of just altering or removing cards permanently.
---
I would stop at "avoiding changes". Unless absolutely necessary. These recent changes weren't absolutely necessary. Most rotation changes would probably be that as well. 
---
Though if they want, they can undo nerfs. They just need to not want to do that. Nerfs are no more permanent than rotations in theory 
---
&gt; Point 1B: Rotated cards would probably never return to Standard
---
Suppose that it's too powerful for Mage to have Mana Wyrm and Fireball.
---
Then one year the rotating core set might have Mana Wyrm but not Fireball. Another year the rotation core set might have Fireball but not Mana Wyrm. So yes, rotated out cards can get rotated back in.
---
This is not just theory. In Magic: the Gathering it seemed like a really efficient spell, Lightning Bolt, would never return to the core set. [And then it did](https://www.cardkingdom.com/images/magic-the-gathering/2010-core-set/lightning-bolt-5502-medium.jpg) - the Magic creators just allocated a lot of their "power budget" for that "class" to Lightning Bolt.
---
&gt; Point 3B: Maintaining a card's text in Wild matters less when it doesn't see play anyway
---
Lots of people aren't hyper-competitive. Lots of people just want to have fun with their goofy decks, even if it's not tier 1. For them, it does suck if their non-top-tier-cards change. (In Magic parlance: not everyone is a Spike. Some people are Johnnies or Timmies.)
---
Also, if I have to decide now whether I want to craft a core set card, then I'll rest easier if I know "I can always play this card, as-is, in wild." It's less comfortable if I have to think "I can play this card in wild, unless two years from now it'll get nerfed, and who knows which cards seem overly strong two years from now."
---
Still got Shudderwock Shaman with Chain Gang in it as well.
---
So 1/3s never saw play in aggro mage, except in the aggro mage they currently see play in? 
---
Then why not censor things only on the chinese version? Thats a thing i ask myself for many other ganes aswell.
---
&gt; if they KNOW a card is going to become problematic with an upcoming expansion, they should be proactive and give it the nerf before hand.
---
They did this with Dreadsteed, it got nerfed with the release of Frozen Throne because it would be broken with Defile.  They don't need to nerf cards in the middle of expansion A because it will be broken in expansion B, they can nerf it with the release of expansion B
---
But then look what the other guy has out on turn 6. This game is nothing but complete bullshit now.
---
U thinking of HoF
---
Because Hearthstone doesn't *want* to be only for men. You just basically summed up the argument. Men are sexualized in media for women, and women are sexualized in media *intended for everyone*.

Best solution I‚Äôve heard is making him summon a 1/1 actor that copies the text of a minion in your deck. It would still provide the high roll opportunity but would only add a normally textless 1/1 token to your revive pool.
---
To be fair, [[Beneath The Grounds]] is an epic card from The Grand Tournament. You don‚Äôt see it very often, and you get the cast when drawn spell in your hand less often then that. Add to it hearthstone consistent inconsistencies and you can see why someone would be confused.

Or it could just be a joke.

&gt; Undoing nerfs and redoing nerfs all the time gets confusing. Might as well rotate.
---
Might as well not change in the first place for the most part, with changes as minimal as possible. I don't feel Classic and Basic are better places in retrospect after seeing what has arisen in the game and how they have played out
---
&gt;I mean, wouldn‚Äôt that be cool if dirty rat came back every now and then?
---
Not for me. I hate that card. and Dr. Boom. And I *really* hated what Deathknights do to the game. See the problem? 
---
&gt;Meta wise, adding back old cards IS the same as adding new cards. 
---
Only if they're good enough to see play, if you're talking strictly about impact. Rotating in cards that don't see play is generally pointless. If you're talking about testing out cards and learning something new (most of what makes new cards interesting), then it's certainly not the same as new cards. Not even close.
---
&gt;the classic set is powerful forever decks are the same and boring. Druid just plays wild growth and nourish and ramps until the end of time
---
Too many assumptions there. It's easy to make rotation seem like a great idea when your imagined alternative is terrible.  
---
 
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt think forcing people who hate malygos to have to deal with it forever is the right move.
---
Everyone hates some cards. There's going to be no escape from that, rotation or not. Forcing people to deal with old cards they hate again isn't great. Talking away people's favorite cards isn't great. 
---
&gt;Before every non Aggro deck always ran wild growth and nourish forever. Boring right? 
---
See, there's that assumption again. Boring? No. I never found it boring. I found it to be a defining part of that class's identity which may have been stripped away once rotation hits and we feel the fuller impact of the decision. *I felt the change was a bad one*. 
---
I don't pretend to know what Hearthstone's aim is, but currently it is very much a male-oriented game and probably always will be.
---
On the one extreme is Blizzard's pretty clear design policy that all woman have giant ass titties and assess, and all men are ripped beyond imaging (With the excretion of OW where they've started mixing up body types which is great). On the other extreme is your imagined scenario where people think women having boobs is vulgar. Both of those viewpoints are pretty idiotic to be honest.
---
I've already dusted him. Twice.
---
WHOOOOOOSH
---
The best answer instantly fixes him as it does nothing to hurt how every deck *other* than big priest uses him.
---
Change his text to: "**Battlecry:** Summon a 1/1 Actor who gains the text box of a random minion in your deck."
---
He can still be used to get a tick off Thaurrisan, +5 spell power from Malygos, double damage from Velen, a big boi beast from Kathrena, a full minion from Y'Shaarj, etc, etc. But you shouldn't be able to get a free 2 mana copy of an 8-10 mana minion from your deck not once, maybe not even twice, but upwards of 4 times. That's what people hate about him.
---
privius#1842 na you go first 80g quest
---
The primary reason why such a change wouldn't be implemented lies with how this change, which has been recommended previously, would both cards more complex. 
---
None of the the card changes made after beta has resulted in the card becoming more complex. At most, they've become less complex.
---
Forgetting Team 5's preference on card changes, that change would probably a much bigger change to the marquee cards from the Witchwood and adversely affect every Odd and Even deck including crap like Even Rogue and Odd Druid rather than just those causing issues.
---
Altering just the hero powers casing issues would be far more productive than dragging every possible Odd and Even deck down out of viability.
---
Alternate between bulking and cutting.  Personally I like to do each phase for about 2 months.  When you are bulking don‚Äôt use it as an excuse to eat whatever you want however.  Also try not to do the same exercise to the point where it gets too easy as you will start to plateau.  Be sure to increase your calorie intake when bulking and also eat protein after a session.
---
*Hm, I wonder why...*
---
I don't really understand the complaint of games playing out similarly. Yes, it centers around the hero power a bit more, but the Genn and Baku decks differ greatly between all the classes. Take Even Warlock, for example. Yes, the hero power is discounted, but playing the deck is far more than just hero tapping each turn. You only have to see high level players with that deck to see that.  
---
It sounds like Kibler's actual complaint is meta staleness which just happens and is hard to shake up unless you nerf big cards all the time. The idea that Genn and Baku are the cause of this is kinda dumb.
---
How'd that happen?
---
Oh I see, thanks

Wow, what an insightful realization, I doubt anyone else has noticed this yet, so thanks for telling us about it.

The change I want to figure out is how does every priest I play against have 6 copies of psychic scream in hand at all times
---
What about Deathlord? It technically can fuck up combo decks but it can also backfire massively if you're playing a midrange deck.
---
It's not the fact that Jaina has boob armor, it's the fact that apparently a large portion of the player base has chosen twenty pixels of boob getting covered up in a card game as the hill they want to die on.
---
Oh my. 
---
LEEEEROOOOYYYY JEEEEENKIIIIINNSSSSS
---
Babbling boob
---
Everyone was wrong. it replaced all my empty slots with dust quests!
---
I completely agree and have commented about it on other Genn and Baku posts.
---
The easiest solution to prevent confusion would likely be change the text on Baku to "Start of Game: if you deck has only Odd-cost cards, gain Baku's Hero Power for your class." It would require some tweaking for formatting, but it would be cleanest option.
---
The inner fire combo is strongly enabled by Shadow Visions and Radiant Elemental. After they both rotate you will naturally see much less of that combo due to its inconsistency.
---
no one understands you, don't worry I'm on your side.
---
I believe you're absolutely wrong about a set of rotation and looking at MTG shows exactly the opposite of what you describe.
---
Hell lightning bolt has rotated back in recently.
---
Having mana wyrm when everybody has ways to deal with it (in this season) would be fine. So you saying it wouldn't and can't work is pretty baseless.

ITT: Aggro player wants to keep his Leeroy Jenkins card forever..
---
Nothing can stop me, nothing! 
---
I would just like to say that I am no longer buying the next expansion due to continuous nerfs to the "core set". I know this doesn't matter much to anyone here, just wanted to voice my opinion. I feel like Blizzard is continuously nerfing cards in classic and basic to the point where classes strengths and weaknesses will be defined 100% by the newest expansions. It seems to push players to purchase more packs from newer expansions, and reduces the importance of packs opened from tavern brawl (CLASSIC!). I was against the druid nerfs, albeit not being a druid player myself.
---
We are now in a era in HS where the "core" set of almost every class being non-playable cards. Priest core is crap, warrior core has been nerfed to crap, on and on. A druid is no longer going to have the core strength of being a ramping class. Mage is only held up by the hero card Jaina....
---
Regardless, I am now done with HS. If you look at the reasons for past nerfs, you'll see the HS team avoiding to nerf "core" strengths and weaknesses (Also, look up the reason for the Leeroy nerf--hilarious in hindsight). This has gone out the window with the NEW HS team, which seems to want to nerf old cards for current standard problem cards (Gaku and Genn), while making wild less and less interesting because of these changes.
---
Suppose I'm just going on a rant, but I am uninstalling HS and will not be playing any expansions. I had played this game since beta and spent around $150 per expansion. This game has become unfun. OTK vs. "kill before OTK" is not a fun game mode. Control decks has not been a thing for awhile, as they lose straight out to OTK, and there is no counter play unless you're a Warlock, and even then, it's a gamble! I'm just disheartened that I was so hyped for the last expansion, and the meta did not accept any new cards--we only saw multiple nerfs to basic/classic.... It's just not worth supporting this anymore. Good luck to you all!
---
From those juicy quest events. 100 dust right there.
---
Just nerfed flametongue totem because of wild, so....
---
Bosses don't get aids, only we the common folk get aids.
---
Very good response, thank you. I'm gonna look in to these deck types! Could you possibly link me to a cheap Zoo Warlock, Midrange Hunter and Odd Paladin deck? Whould really help me since I don't know what to look for if I were to look for it myself :)
---
ok, but my point is that the battlecry keyword wouldn't work; the fix would either be a new keyword or to explicitly describe the effect
---
&gt;Priest is strongly enabled by Shadow Visions and Radiant Elemental. After they both rotate you will naturally see much less of that class due to its inconsistency.

7,000 is still a lot of dust. The main thing about Odd Paladin is that the legendaries (Leeroy and Baku) are neutral and usable in a lot of decks, so they're worth a lot more than something like Zul'Jin that only fits in one type of deck in one class. Not to mention that Leeroy is a classic set legendary, too. The only comparable decks without super specific legendaries would then be Odd Rogue and Zoolock, of which that stat site is still showing the pre-nerf Odd Rogue with cold blood so that leaves just Zoolock...
---
Then a 4% winrate difference between Odd Paladin and Zoolock (I don't have premium so can't see rank specific winrates), I wonder what deck people are gonna prefer playing...

Literally the opposite experience. Odd Mage, Odd Pally and Midrange Hunter abound. Been farming them with Odd Warrior. Pretty boring meta, but it'll diversify once people start playing the nerfed decks again.
---
uh its true, just barnes into yshaarij is something evry class can asnwer,not all options are as good or as concistent but evry class can answer it.
---
Druid has mulch and natrulize and poison seeds
---
Hunter can deadly shot(wont Always work but its something that can,any mech + venomizer and spiderbomb aswell
---
Mage has  ,polymorph,polymorph boar,glyph into meteor,or it can just freeze them multiple times while mage goes face 
---
Palladin can equality + any minions or hero power tokens on field to clear it and before nerf could equality +pryo.
---
Priest has shadowword death
---
Rogue has assinate,walk the plank,coin(or counterfit coin) into vilespine,plague scientist possibly,prep into spellstone can. aslo sap and prep into vanish
---
shaman can double crackle, can volcano,crushing hand + any 2dmg,can freeze yshaarij aswell
---
Warlock has unwilling sacriface,blast crystal potion, cataclysm,bloodbloom into siphon soul/nether/doom
---
Warrior has execute,smolderthorn lancer,shield slam if its odd pally can kill it by then ,crush possibly
---
Neutral Big game hunter if you have coin else wait a turn and can asnwer it,kabal courier for the kabal classes,tinkmaster.
---
So no evry class has atleast 1thing that can asnwer a turn 4 yshaarij. The problem comes forth from the resses.
---
That‚Äôs why I only dust cards that are bad. 
---
they'll not focus on new player's experience a month from the year's rotation, when we get to the new year's first expansion they'll do events that cater to new players again
---
the game isn't dying because you noticed some month-old act of them
---
Bad standard cards too. 
---
&gt; How? The only way to do it, would be to print cards so insanely powerful that losing some even or odd cards wouldn't be viable.
---
No? They just have to outweigh the benefit of the upgraded or cheaper hero power.
---
We'll also have fewer cards in general, so losing access to half of them is a bigger deal automatically.
---
&gt; Just to clear a misconception: If they print weak cards it doesn't make Baku/Genn useless; It makes them stronger. 
---
Yes, the power level overall going down with rotation is the biggest concern I have.
---
Note that we currently have *strong* cards that specifically benefit from Baku or Genn, like Odd Mage's Black Cat and Jan'alai. So some of the Odd/Even decks are being pushed by those cards too even now, and not just by Baku and Genn themselves.
---
&gt; Also worth noting that the weaker the cards are, the stronger OTK decks become.
---
That's obviously not accurate because OTK decks need cards that enable the OTK. The weakest meta we've ever had was vanilla and we didn't have a single viable OTK deck then.
---
same happen to me on PC, i could only connect using VPN
---
Cards are dustable now, so while it may have been a problem then, it's irrelevant now. I agree it would feel bad buying 4 wings for 1 card, but that's an exaggeration considering there were a LOT of good cards in BRM that saw play in competitive decks (Patron, Thaurissan, Blackwing corruptor, Imp Gang Boss ). And it's not like this problem disappears with expansions; you still need to either drop money on packs or dust your existing cards in order to get new cards you want. 
---
You're right that BRM wings were worth less than 600 dust each, but again, I think it was made up for with the card quality and the fact that a decent chunk of the cards were stuff you actually wanted and didn't need to DE. 
---
But both [LoE](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/The_League_of_Explorers) and [Karazhan](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/One_Night_in_Karazhan) were higher than the 1:1 dust to gold ratio (LoE gave 3170 dust for 2800g and Kara gave 2950 for 2800g). And again, there's no pack RNG with adventures. You know what you're getting, and the % of cards you'll keep from the adventure wings is higher than the % of cards you keep from packs. So 100% the adventures were better value than packs are. 
---
&gt; Then why has it not been used in Rogue aggro decks in wild/standard that aren't odd?
---
You sure you ply hearthstone?
---
Nice!
---
I had a golden Spellstone and 8 regular ones.

Supper collider. Smashing your dinner since 1865.

You said you had 150 losses, but losses from opponents having 1 or 2 legendaries is more than 150
---
He enables a lot of decks that wouldn't exist without him, which are hardly as oppressive/consistent as many existing aggressive and OTK decks. I've never been tilted by a Barnes on curve. It's fortunate for them, but it's not as polarising a matchup as you make out (imo).
---
Wow this shows you have no clue what you are talking about.
---
Gtfo. 
---
Damn, I mean it isn't even *that* gratuitous. My eyes would be rolling into the next dimension if my wife was really bothered by something like that. 
---
100,000 players that spend money are more valuable than 5,000,000 who don't!
---
It's the WoW model. 
---
Even Rogue sees fringe play in Wild.
---
You're assuming Hunter doesn't already have a board to deal with the 3/4 and 1/1 to make the 10/10 a guaranteed hit. Spoiler alert; they probably do.
---
Druid isn't *completely* dumpstered in Wild - but even if that were the case, the decks that do exist run Poison seeds and its quantity of play is irrelevant for this discussion.
---
Crushing Hand sees play is *some* (definitely not most) Even Shaman decks, you're right. And about that second point...
---
&gt;And if you ~~use your Crackle as removal~~ (are) against Big Priest you've probably already lost.
---
**TL; DR**: OTK decks are balanced by the fact that they are inherently weak to aggressive plays, unlike control decks, and their place in the meta is countering control decks. 
---
Of course, with combo archetype defining only a core of the deck, that is an actual combo, combo decks can use tempo shell just as well as control one (see Shudderwock Shaman that even included Prince Keleseth and had a decent curve with all the saronites and lifedrinkers), but tempo shell usually conflicts with the fact that combo pieces are dead cards in hand until you have a full combo (this was not the case with Shudderwock because it didn't require holding on to combo pieces unlike most combo decks). Therefore, most of combo decks use control shell (stall/removal) with combo pieces and card draw instead of value generators and threats. This means that, unlike control deck that can capture the board with board clears and start deploying threats as soon as it has stabilized, combo deck's stabilization point is when it plays the combo (and supposedly wins the game). Until that point, combo deck always plays from behind and can be abused by any deck that has a wincondition other than fatiguing enemy to death.
---
While it is obviously easier and more natural to play aggressive as an aggressive deck, it is not impossible to pressure with most of control decks as well. For example, odd mage has a decent amount of pressure in Jan'alai, Astromancers and even Baku himself (7/8 is no joke!), same goes for control priest with early Twilight Drakes, Alextrasza, Mind Blasts etc. As long as your theats line up well, you can pressure combo deck out of the game, especially if combo player is not patient enough with their resources.
---
That being said, combo as an archetype is generally considered a counter to control, just as well as aggro is a counter to combo, and I fail to see a problem in this, especially considering that combo decks are almost never tier 1 and very rarely tier 2. For example, right now the highest rated combo deck is a Combo (Inner Fire) Priest on 12th place by winrate with five control decks being higher than that. 
---
This is why I left Hearthstone
---
I did. It means ordinary person, typically from lower social standard...you think thats what he is, because he doesnt have as much cards as you? hmm...

This is not feasible, if you don't either play a lot, played for a long time already, buy packs or get lucky, admittedly.
---
Nice.

You know this the tavern brawl right? It plays a random spell each time you play a minion and they got power word replicate
---

It's like you never seen a roast before. Google types of humor and then you tell me what type it is.
---
I don't get the last step.
---
So, blingtron plays Twig and casts Flurry, cool 10 mana. But, how do you play DK AND spam hero power 4 times? Your hero power still costs two. That's a 17 mana turn at the end. 
---
Explain your self. 
---
DK costs 1.
---
Aha!

Yep. Just realized after hitting submit.

And neither of those was ever tier one, with best ones being Druid and Paladin decks in tier 2 (because they had a fairly control-ish playstyle), and they are all dumpstered now anyway. The highest winrate combo deck is Inner Fire priest at 12th place, with 5 control decks ahead of it.

It wont, but its nerf will slow the deck down enough that itll have a hard time against aggro and midrange. Standard has a perfectly functional deck that runs without barnes, so I'm sure big priest wont just magically disappear when one card gets nerfed.

Those cards you listed (UTH and Rhino) have been in the game since the inception and it's never been a problem at any time in the past. So, that tells me that Hyena isn't as (independently strong) as you are trying to present. 
---
It's a culmination of Blizzard giving Hunter a ridiculous set of tools (healing, card draw, rush beasts) to make the card strong. 
---
Cards like Frothing and Questing adventurer actually broke metas because they were given strong support cards that made them broken (ie. Patron Warrior and Conceal Miracle Rogue) and had to nerf the decks. I don't see the same thing happening with the Hunter decks that feature it.
---
Sorry, what?
---
The only 2 truly control decks in top 2 tiers current are priest and warrior, with some consideration to even paladin. If it's turn 5 and you're playing one of those decks, your opponent is aggro, you're at or above 20 health, and they have little to no board, you will win 90% of the time. If it's turn 5 and they have a board and you don't have a clear this turn, you lose 90% of the time.
---
That's kind of the point, games are very often decided very early.
---
Just because it's /s doesn't mean it's /whoosh, buddy boy. On this subreddit, I've learned that most things aren't /s. In fact, that's becoming more true for Reddit as a whole. I see too much serious stupid shit on here that when something is /s like this, I assume they actually believe it.

Pretty much.

I didn't treat you like an enemy only up to in my edit. And you did god damn same thing.

Huh, Neat.

I think that a set that blizzard can change at wild without destroying the cards In It would be better for them. They don't have to print heals for warlock to exist and board clears for priest every year. If they need a heal for warlock they can move an old card in and focus on their new vision for warlock without issues.maybe they want a new Murdock warlock so they print a few support cards and move that old Murdock warlock had? Maybe they want aggro priest but avoid adding board clears. Dragon paladin? Let's move equality away for this one. Lots of cheap spells for mage? Can't have mana wyrm this year
---
I find it quite aggravating lol but that's just me
---
The Garlcient One
---
I remember there being only a few decks that did OK against it. Patron Warrior did pretty well, especially due to pre-nerf Warsong, Fiery War Axe and Execute. You had lots of ways to take care of his secrets, and GET DOWN helped create another Patron.
---
But Secret Paladin's perfect curve was insanely hard to beat. The funny thing is that it isn't good at all in Wild anymore. Too many better, stronger decks thanks to Genn/Baku.
---
This is true to some extent, when players skill is equal. However, if one side makes a mistake, other can usually capitalize on that mistake and win an unfavored matchup, that's why unfavored matchups in Hearthstone are usually more like 30% wr than 3% wr (unless you're playing exodia mage vs aggro mage, aggro mage player can drool on their keyboard and throw random green cards and you can have the best draw of your life and you will still lose, rant over). 
---
Also a noteble feature of combo decks is that they often enough lose to themselves: with hand limit being only 10 cards and half of your deck being a card draw, you're bound to sometimes end up in a situation where you have to waste resources to not mill yourself, especially so if you are inexperienced with the deck.
---
My IQ isn't high enough to comprehend this. Maybe a few more ricks.
---
Also I think you don't need 2 vanishes... Maybe 1 or none it's pretty slow, you get your minions back and hemet doesn't destroy it
---
its probably the hardest deck in this meta to play, so unless youre playing apm priest or something youre probably worse.
---
Gentleman Garrosh skin when
---
It's pretty good, I would keep it if you like playing Paladin.
---
Only rich people or fools spend anymo on hearthstone
---
I'd keep him. When the rotation hits, healadin might become viable when all the otk strategies lose many of their combo pieces
---
&gt;the Magic creators just allocated a lot of their "power budget" for that "class" to Lightning Bolt.
---
From a casual player, I don't think I'm okay with this. Take for example both Ultimate Infestation and Spreading Plague in Druid, two cards that have single-handedly shifted the focus of "what Druid is" for the last two years. I'm not familiar with the outlined case in MTG, but having a card so powerful in any "rotating core set" will become:
---
A) An auto-include in any deck if they're not niche cards, which dilutes deck diversity
---
B) A limitation on class potential
---
For clarification on B, if a class gets several powerhouse cards, they can only get so many other worthwhile cards or risk becoming OP. A niche card example would be the Rogue quest, extremely powerful with the right tools and oppressive enough to see nerfs. A non-niche card would be UI or Spreading Plague in Druid, one of which was nerfed and one of which has been begged for nerfs.
---
Could you, in theory, have these cards return as part of a rotating core set to these classes? Of course. But a lot of people would rather see Quest Rogue, UI and Spreading Plague kneecapped because of how it warps the game. And nobody wants a Naga Sea Witch situation in Wild again because Blizzard sees Wild as an "anything goes" format that doesn't need nerfs.
---
Ohh boy, in come the tears from the players who feel these types of tech cards shouldn't exist, because it renders their entire archetype useless.
---
That said, I think that's only part of the solution. What all OTK decks have in common, are their requirement to cycle through their decks as quickly as they possibly can, all but ignoring the board until they need to use a clear.
---
So I think neutral card draw needs to be Hall of Famed. Novice Engineer and Loot Hoarder are the prime offenders, being easy and cheap card draw.

---
How would they even nerf baku and genn? Even if you make them 9-10 costs with 1/1 they would be just as powerful. And if you make them "1-2 damage" or the like they would be completely destroy ed. Only thing i can imagine is "deals 10 damage to face to buff hero power" 
---
Wouldn't it be great if every fucking minion played on both sides just cast Cataclysm every turn. 
---
Not really. It was obnoxious but not OP. It's far more tame than Zul'jin giving them all back to a Hunter. If this card was really OP, it would see play in Wild. 
---
It doesn't.
---
Should have played around it.
---
Keep her. Very fun 10 Mana combo if you have zilliax and mechwarper. Extremely satisfying when you pull it off. Put this combo in a Reno deck. Unfortunately it's only playable in wild.
---
HSReplay and general knowledge of the match-up.
---
Against Deathrattle Hunter, Clone Priest only manages to win against it fifty-four percent of the time, far from a polarized match-up.
---
No way O_o REALLY?!?
---
I have the cardbacks viewing bug. But it‚Äôs not after one page. (About 4-5 pages in then it just freezes up and have to restart the app).
---
F
---
I‚Äôll dispute that. That deck still runs ~20 cards from expansions. That the next best classic/basic cards include the ones you mention shows how hard it would be to find 20 more that aren‚Äôt just bad.
---
I'm upvoting because this is an important discussion to have and you've clearly put a lot of thought into it.  I disagree with almost every conclusion you reach and think that you're ignoring some simple routes to address the problems you raise, but I'm glad the conversation is being had.
---
I've pretty much left Hearthstone at this point for MTG and MTGA, and I don't miss the idea of a core set one bit - even as a mostly F2P player who would benefit from being able to pull guaranteed value from an "evergreen" pool of cards.  
---
I feel very strongly that Hearthstone's evergreen set is directly responsible for some of the game's stagnation and lack of diversity, admittedly largely in combination with other aggravating factors like hero powers and limited class pools.  I don't buy into the idea that solving part of the problem is not worthwhile if you don't solve the whole problem, however.  
---
I think the design space that Team 5 have bought themselves by nerfing or removing evergreen standards like the Druid ramp core is very small but very real, and they would get drastically better returns from doing away with the concept altogether - but whether the dedicated playerbase would stick around through that large a change to the game is very unclear.
---
The art is Kingsbane the Rogue weapon. When it is suppose to be a different art. Just a visual weird bug.
---
!redditsilver
---
Lol i hope you are being sarcastic
---
I played Kingsbane, followed by Deadly Poison. Valeeras hero power is a card which becomes a copy of the last card you played. This is a visual bug which has the correct text and an incorrect image.
---
King's Poisonbane: Give your attack +2 Poison.
---
It had one of the best 1-7 curves, short of Undertaker Priest. It had strong plays every turn.
---
Thats quite a nerf lol. Like a crappier hyena after that. Glad I avoided it lol!
---
It definitely does. It's a pretty straightforward deck, it has a linear gameplan, and if you lose tempo, you more or less lose on the spot. It just so happens that it's pretty damn good at not losing tempo.
---
Woah Undertaker priest was even a thing? Oh god
---
&gt; I don't know. I'm not really convinced by the whole idea that there needs to be control, aggro, and combo. That idea is repeated over and over by the CCG crowd, but I haven't seen any evidence this has to be the case (if it could even be proven).
---
It has been proven over and over. Its the base of the game, to begin with. Just go check some MTG articles about this.
---
&gt; The point was just to show that it's possible not to have aggro and combo.
---
Its impossible. If there is no aggro, decks wont slot early removal, then people will just slot all the lower cost cards and go face early. You can even win right now that way if the opponent is playign some weird deck, wihtout playing a real good aggro, just random 1 drops with the higher attack possible.
---
Just read something about the topic instead of arguing about something debated and studied 25 years ago.
---
Posted another one that shows i have 8 mana crystal(2 are locked) and opponent 0/1
---
Fair point
---
Ya, only change I made was -1 primordial Drake for Mojo. But that was pre-nerf
---
How good has spirit of the rhino felt? ive been messing around with rush warrior but I haven't been playing it sense it isn't a tempo one drop
---
cheat death technically which is hilarious 
---
\[Undertaker\] Undertaker got +1/+1 befor the nerf
---
\[Haunted Creeper**\]**
---
\[Mad Scientist\]
---
\[Webspinner\] 
---
Because, compared to two bankers this is how the board state would be:
---
1 banker 1 brew:
---
Banker&gt;brew the banker&gt; 1 brew on field
---
2 bankers&gt; banker, then banker again. &gt; 2 bankers on field
---
It just leaves u with a stronger board state to trade and survive longer. 
---
I guess you could do 2 bankers and a brew if u need but it seems unnecessary.
---
Got that spell that gives 10 mana crystals and discard hand
---
Otk angry chicken hunter is fun
---
Only aggro priest deck ive ever heard of and even tried myself was Murloc priest lol. Seems as Blizz actually knew what to nerf back in the day though , now we have 2 mana hunter mark nerfs...
---
isn't her name mrs fowl? 
---
My post is not disagreeing with that. I am saying the card was designed to be a stand alone 4 drop. It‚Äôs role changed into an archetype enabler. Spell based hunter decks running barnea and ysharj is an example of the card moving into a niche archetype type enabler.
---
The stats and mana cost not reflect what the card is actually doing.
---
I guess 4 people like Barnes how it is? No clue why I got downvoted.
---
Yeah.. F for real.. f for the quests im missing...
---
its outstanding,
---
you never play it as a tempo play, you usually throw it t4 or t5 mixed with one of your 3 or 4 drop rushers and clear there guy and come out immune.
---
never keep it in an opener unless you have the absolute nuts lol just draw into it
---
it's good late game too and can chunk big minions. Plus it works with ziliax you dont break divine shield so you get that bonus.

Deadly Kingsbane: Your charge minions have +1 attack
---
Pretty much everything you did would screw you up, kill their challenger, it gets rezzed with 1 health, try to attack something, you‚Äôll instead kill a 2/1 and buff up their minion. Ignore it, everything gets buffed.
---
And then if you manage to clear all those secrets they‚Äôll probably just play another Mysterious, sealing the game.
---
&gt; you are doing it wrong.
---
No. If you look at the photo you can see the cards it directly buffed. 
---
Pretty dumb hypothetical then.
---
Oh cant forget zombie chow on 1, the best 1 drop for board control at the time (possibly ever)
---
Thanks, I've already updated the thread with the newest version.
---
The Tavern Brawl never shows the spell that is cast, just the effect of the spell.
---
So if I play a Snowflipper Penguin and it casts Assassinate, it'll show the Penguin killing an enemy minion. 
---
I already did when I switched to play only Adventures and despite my 130+ bosses defeated I have yet to complete one run. All because those fucking bosses have the perfect card draw and board clear. /salt
---
Yay ty team!
---
Just nerf specific hero powers for whatever genn decks are dominating. Other than that idk.
---
OMG, who did this? We got an ingame cleavage police now? Will they come after my Drenai's bust line? I see a lot of transmog sets getting ruined if this hits the world of warcraft.
---
Rude
---
Today's OTK decks have:
---
- Cheap card draw(including the neutrals I just mentioned)
---
- Armor gain/life heal/outright turn stall
---
- AoE/Board clears
---
- Deck thinning
---
They have everything they need to fend off aggro, *and* they are all but a death sentence against slower decks that don't populate the board quickly as part of their game plan.
---
As for the "destroys a lot of decks" - can you think of an aggro, midrange, or control-style deck that uses 2 x Novice Engineers? No, right? Now - Quest Priest uses 2 x Loot Hoarders, so yes that would be hit.
---
But the more controlly decks would use something like Acolyte of Pain, which is not mentioned in my HOF list. 
---
This is why my solution is a far more straight forward one. Remove some of the neutral card draw, which hits the point #1. Points #2, 3, and 4 will be impacted somewhat by the rotation(but we want a solution sooner - 2 months is *still a long time* to wait).
---
I hear you. I hate those dastardly OTK decks too, no matter how many times people here say "but they're not tier 1 decks and are only 30% of the ladder". 
---
i mean you could just store the deck codes with their names in a plain text file. Also who the hell has that many decks?!?
---
&gt; There have been cards 'ruining hearthstone' since beta lol. 
---
Like what, that hasn't been nerfed?
---
&gt; Nerfing/removing the cards and giving a full dust refund is already overkill. 
---
Orly?  Anyone who spent the majority of their dust crafting druid decks before last December would beg to differ.
---
&gt;  A bonus 2k dust is just you wanting free shit. 
---
I couldn't care less about 2k dust.   I spend the money to have all the cards I need.  The 2k dust is a solution for everyone who would feel ripped off after spending the dust to create even/odd decks and then losing them.
---
Looks like the opponent is a rogue, and OP got the kingsbane from a burgle effect.
---
I would say in general it is much less than people might think. Even in odd/even decks which very much put emphasis on using your hero power I still find myself using it 4-7 times per game on average depending on the deck.
---
You only reach 10+ uses if a game goes super long in the right matchups.
---
Yeah so.. the battlecry triggers AFTER the random spell iirc, so this doesnt work (if the hearthpwn article is to be believed)
---
And that, children, is how you take the L like a champ
---
Really solid idea. Sometimes I like just keeping decks without having hundreds of entries on my deck tracker or notes on my phone. 
---
That's true, but at least Kathrena comes out on a much later turn. 5 mana skull comes out quite early. And with skull shenanigans, it's just endless value.
---
If i'm on the rank 5 floor i'll do it just for the slim chance of pulling Barnes. Feels so good.
---
I don't think I've heard of a bug that does that. 
---
The closest I can think of is the old bug where two cards would be on top of each other in your hand, which causes you to "pick up" the wrong card.
---
Arcane is the mobile version
---
Jeef cleef.
---
Armor yes, but eternium rover no, you would gain the armor after being reduced to 0
---
Hard to say without knowing what's coming next, but Genn, Baku, Zilliax and Oondasta are safe crafts.
---
Don't craft cards, craft decks.
---
Yayyy
---
Matter Orders
---
Anyone have a link to this album/thread?
---
Casual players dont want strong cards to appear again?
---
why not just save deck codes in a word document? thats what i do. no need to download tons of unwanted programs.
---
I would drop cold bloods personally
---
Vicious syndicate called them "dead"
---
Keleseth is much better
---
There are a lot of things to replace them with.  The closest "1-for-1" replacements are 1 drops that buff your guys (eg acherus veteran) or cold blood.  But strong 3, 4 or 5 drops also work.  Cobalt and another 3 drop could be reasonable for your deck.
---
So hard to say
---
Used to recommend genn/baku but with blizz nerfing everything in sight I just don't know anymore
---
I would say ziliax is a very safe craft still
---
my opponent also got myras but few minions later he shuffled jade idol in deck so i lost
---
So I guess I‚Äôm the only one turned on ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
As I said, it matters in terms of power but not play experience. You seem to recognize this. The direct parallel in Hearthstone is wild growth on two mana versus three mana, or war axe on two vs three. Or soul fire at zero or one. 
---
You could imagine they rotated those cards and replaced them with worse versions. Like bolt and shock. 
---
When people see those cards hit the board, I don‚Äôt think their experience is one of novelty once you hold power constant. Weakening them does make for different gameplay experience, but not in the freshness sense
---
This was a nice post :)
---
Yeah fair point. Im hearing good things about it .
---
Unfortunately most of the legendaries are needed you can replace it with a big Rush Minion but you lose a lot of value and the deck isn't built on value to begin with so you can replace it it just makes it worse
---
You're so dumb that you think doing something within the rules will get them banned for no reason, so I thought you'd need the placebo definition :) 
---
In as much as fun equals non-oppressive power, I completely agree. Providing a class with powerful tools that do not prevent other classes from using theirs is exactly where I think we should aim
---
I‚Äôm glad you agree with me
---
&gt; It would have been better and would be less painful had they nerfed these cards long ago, but it's hard to catch everything.
---
This is quite true. People are looking at these nerfs and pontificating about how "nerfing the Classic set doesn't solve anything", and missing that it's really the belated realization that certain changes have been needed which have not been apparent until more recently. It's kind of a damned if you do, damned if you don't for Blizzard, but it has to be done *sometime* anyways.
---
Granted, "sometime" could have been chosen better, but it wasn't. I think that's a large part of the current problem.
---
Thought I was on a r/talesfromthecustomer for a second. Lmao
---
And we can welcome the year of "race to OTK".
---
Someone did a well known combo against you? Wow never seen before such originality made my day quality content
---
Fairpoint's fungle is not a bad option
---
I wasn't a fan of fester root but after using it a lot it builds up really quick it's usually up to five or six attack within one turn or two
---
the lack of 3s hasn't been a huge issue as I usually hard Mulligan for a three or four but you can always one drop hero power and that's not a terrible play but I agree with you I'm hoping to get some more Rush cards next set!
---
I think my favorite dirty rat misplay was when my opponent played it turn 2 and it pulled my [[Deathwing, Dragonlord]]. My opponent didn‚Äôt last very long.
---
Stupid sexy Valeera!
---
That was the most fun video &amp; photoshops we‚Äôve made in a while :) Watch to nr 1! 
---
&gt; So you often end up not tapping just because you'd burn cards
---
Yeah of course. I try to play a card whenever I tap too.
---
That will leave you with a tiny sample size.
---
And so what? Just because someone is Legend and has a lot of games doesn't mean a skill intensive deck can't take a hit. 
---
I completely agree , only real counters are like OTK decks like Mecathun were you dont care about their health you just want your combo done. That one card witchwood that destroys enemy secrets and flare for hunter is a good start but even with these secrets are a pain. Odd Secret mage has been destroying lately I heard.
---
Prepare for secret paladin to text you now
---
Lo stesso a me - same here... 
---
totally agree.  
---
I tried a few times to make the healing synergy work, but this will not sustain you. you need to look outside of healing. you want a few circles of protection, apart from that inner fire is great. one can also go full blown bwonsamdi. at least for me that worked. healing alone won't work.  
---
bottom tier: agree on shirvallah's vengeance, would put the warlock damage redirection shrine there as well. also shirvallah's protection has such a terrible early game and board control via tempo, that it usually get's overrun, regardless of how superpowerful the shrine effect is. i think i tried this shrine more often than any other and i am still not done with it. even having 2 walking fortress together with e.g. spells cost less shrine (for ringing the bells): no chance. i never could find suitable earlygame to help me get board control (by having decent 1 &amp; 2 drops) and enemy snowballs out of control.  
---
halazzi is not easy, but i would suggest to place it higher than bottom tier.  
---
Youre right. Yikes . Seems like secret paladin back then  worse than secret hunter right now
---
I played a few dozen matches with it before the nerf.  It was a good deck before the nerf, just not as good as Odd or Even Paladin before.  Now with both of those taking a nerf it's closer, and I could see a meta shaping in a way to make it the top Pally deck.
---
you do need to tag it outside of any MTG sub though. I'm pretty sure he just edited his comment to remove the tag.
---
I think it was more [this](https://kakuchopurei.com/2018/12/11/report-chinas-gaming-ban-list-revealed-fortnite-pubg-on-it/) from a while back. Hearthstone not on the list but I can imagine them figuring it's better to be safe than sorry.
---
Though there's a ton of revealing card art, so it seems a bit odd to just change one
---
I couldn't possibly be any more the opposite. Minion slugfests or control draw go's are absurdly boring. I'd take 100 otk opponents before my next control opponent. Without any question whatsoever.
---
Ya, that Mech in is hand IS a Dragon.
---
Shouldn't the country with the best government be critical of others in an attempt to make them better 
---
&gt;more than a finisher
---
Read again. I'm well aware that you often used it as a finisher, it's just that it also was a great early game card as well, and thinking of it as Odd Rogue just losing a finisher is wrong.
---
Patches The Pirate maybe?
---
His Drakkari Trickster gave him another Drakkari Trickster twice in a row.
---
wow, you outplayed him hard. competitive skill based game.
---
Maybe Finja
---
Ah, thanks
---
Probably not the right forum to ask this but prior to about 6 or so months ago, no one used the word "interactive" when describing what they want out of the game, now it's in every other post.
---
I am genuinely curious, what is so great about interaction? Isn't your intention when queuing to win? Would you rather lose an interactive game than win a non-interactive one?
---
The process of effect resolutions go like this:
---
Opponent actives spell -&gt; Mana Bind Triggers -&gt; Mana Bind resolve -&gt; Spell effect resolves.
---
This is how stacked or chained effects typically works in other games where the last card added to the stack/chain resolve first.
---
You claim that it was originally intended to be played as a Chillwind Yeti.  I think that's the part people disagree with.
---
Actually, World of Warcraft is already censored from the bottoms up in China. Check youtube to see chinese world of warcraft. Not sure about Hearthstone, but following logic... Anyway, all this noise with the companies to try and get the attention of the far-lefties is way too annoying nowadays.
---

You have a reality TV personality for president - it just doesn't get any worse than that. :) 
---
True I was thinking rotation - hence my point on it not being worth a craft at all now. It's too close and you don't get the dust back.
---
Nah more than that
---

Doesn't that sum up OTK minus the OTK?

Maybe you played me :D did I get shrink on all minions after 1 hit with my dino size?

He's being very polite. It's almost impossible you're this dumb. Sure.. China is a 'fascist' country, I won't even bother trying to suss that out so by all means believe that. 
---
Your enthusiasm to 'change this' back to.. what it used to be? I guess-- Who is that going to help? So they put Jaina's tiddy cleavage back in the game, who has been improved by the situation? This is the hill you'll die on? Christ man.. Get a grip. 
---
I bought the 40 packs wild bundle a month ago.  I got a golden justicar trueheart and another legendary I‚Äôm forgetting in the same pack along with two epics. That was the third ten pack. In the fourth ten pack, I AGAIN got two legendaries in the same pack.  If my phone would install the update I‚Äôd be able to remind myself what the other three legendary cards were lol.
---
That's the consensus of a lot of people.
---
I feel you buddy, I had a turn where I played a minion which fireballed my face, then I played a beast which kill commanded my face, and then I played another minion which gave my opponents only minion Blessing of Kings.....that game didn‚Äôt go well at all. 
---
Nah, I‚Äôve hated hunter since classic Smorc. It‚Äôs the one class I‚Äôd have no issue with removing from the game entirely. I‚Äôve never found anything interesting or redeeming about the class, it doesn‚Äôt make any interesting decks, it doesn‚Äôt interact with the board, it‚Äôs pure face damage. It‚Äôs like playing ‚Äúred deck wins‚Äù in MTG, sure it‚Äôs efficient, but it‚Äôs boring to play with and against. 
---
If that‚Äôs your bag, fine. More power to you. But you can‚Äôt sit there and tell me there‚Äôs anything creative or interactive about hunters. 
---
OTK may be a one trick pony, but it‚Äôs creative. Aggro may be, well, aggressive, but at least it synergizes and relies on other minions to get going. And combo is also at least creative. 
---
There‚Äôs never been anything interesting about hunter. It‚Äôs has been and will most likely always be ‚Äúme go face.‚Äù

Now, downvote away.

Its likely awful, the chap in the vid plays a lot of creative combo decks for the fun of it (and the videos for youtube)
---
This ones really fun because of the rng, having every minion cast a random spell makes some hilarious interactions.
---
eh, i'm rather fond of steamed broccoli with butter melted all over.  Those who eat raw broccoli on the other hand...  
---
Right so wild ... nfi about wild but standard right now otk/combo is much easier to get away with a lot more control.  
---
Take control priest with the setup for mindblast.  Almost everything is setup to just keep the board clear and remove pressure for the inevitable mind blast setup.  
---
Luckily for that deck even the minions they have add to the assistance of removal such as dusk breaker, crowd roaster, cabal shadow priest.    
---
This to me isn't a control deck, it's a combo/otk deck (so it's really mislabelled).   
---
&gt;Without the rest of your post, I'd have assumed this was commenting on control. This is exactly what control does, they just shut your game down for 7 turns then play Lich King turn 8 for their first offensive action. How is that any more enjoyable?  
---
Because I have a chance to remove Lich King one way or another.  I don't get a say in "boom you're dead and there is not a single thing you can do to stop it".  
---
Maybe then play the wisp list? If you find space in the list.
---
Well, what's the sample rate? Plenty of 60% wr decks on Hsreplay with just a few hundred games played.
---
yeah, that's true. The idea is that if you don't have any deck that you want to make at the moment it's useless to dust your extra cards, not that you should forego making a deck to get more dust. 
---
Well met... you Dirty Rat
---
Try to get all the quests done.  An hour every 3 days if you can.  The 10g/3 wins is almost inconsequential in comparison.  If you do, you'll get to the point where you run a decent number of decks after a few months.
---
Also, be conservative with your dust but also don't keep bad cards.  25% dust may not seem like a lot, but it does add up faster than you'd think.
---
&gt; Against interactive decks, when I lose I can think "what if I had traded with this minion and not that one" and actually feel like I'm improving as a player.
---
I'm not trying to be a dick when I say this, I'm truly not, but the skill cap for this game is extremely low. Figuring out optimal trades is 90% of the time incredibly obvious. Again, I'm not saying that as some pathetic self brag, but it has been obvious for me since about a week or 2 into playing when to trade and when to face. I can say I'm probably improved some since then mostly by increasing my card pool knowledge to know what outs you could have but it's fairly straight forward.
---
Also, coming from someone who played a lot, won a lot, and lost a lot of poker, you can't ever be results oriented. You can't tell yourself it was wrong to leave yourself with 2 X/2 minions instead of 1 X/5 minion just because he had Primordial Drake. You play in a way that maximizes your outs taking into account his sensible counterplays and if it costs you the match, it isn't a learning moment, you already did the right play.
---
&gt; Surely you can sympathize? I've seen you post that you enjoy combo because you feel like you actually have control over whether you win or lose, it's not so much RNG. If you just enjoy winning, you shouldn't care what archetype you play, right? You just play the best one at the moment.
---
And to a certain extent I do, but it becomes almost immediately tiring because I play optimally but lose because they had that one card. Nothing I could have done to increase my EV% (expected value, to use a poker term), I just got unlucky. It's unbearable to lose to someone who won simply because they choose to play with and drew a card. How did he outplay me? He knew what the card was when he put it in his deck and chose it for this reason, and because I was his opponent and he drew that card he just wins?
---
And I know what you might be saying: that sounds an awful lot like playing against combo. And I can admit for some people that would be just as frustrating. The difference I'd point out is the combo player had to devote his entire deck to making that play. A control warlock can throw in 2 Defiles and still have 28 other cards to play with.
---
To my side for sure. 
---
I didn‚Äôt see one person say it would work. 
---
How, was it all greedy decks? I was getting dumpsters by anything remotely aggro. Tbf I'm missing Shaw and zihi but they don't seem like enough to drastically change how the deck plays

I pseudo-focus until I hit rank 5, then I screw around with fun decks afterwards.  I also auto-concede to anyone below rank 5 because legend is pointless once you've got the cardback.

They get packs or gold? I would not know. I was never level 50.
---
&gt; Because I have a chance to remove Lich King one way or another. I don't get a say in "boom you're dead and there is not a single thing you can do to stop it".
---
But so what if you do? You're now at 2 cards in hand, he has 7. Unless you pull a rabbit out from whence the sun dare not shine, you have lost the game. You remove his Lich King and he just plays some other threat a turn or 2 later. Or doesn't, and just incrementally knocks you down. You're never going to get the upper hand ever again because 15 of 30 cards in his deck are removal, and in virtually all cases cost less in cards or mana than what is being removed. Continuing to play puts you in a continually worse and worse position.
---
Like the bolt posts they place weeks before the events?
---
Not sure why people are downvoting you instead of just correcting you. Sorry sir but all packs are equal.
---
Imo it's fine because the card is pretty bad. If this were a competitive card I'd agree it would be horrible but I'm ok with cards with terrible winrates that let you do stupid things, like Astral Communion.

Or he might not attack yet

They get exactly what I said, when I said.

They need to make them in app, I only play mobile.

Jesus christ... It may not seem like that big of a deal.... but this is the beginning of a slippery slope my friends. Let women have control over what they wear! This isn't Iraq!

Imagine if most of the users here were from NA... Wait...

Kripp? Is that you?

Thanks for the response! To answer your questions:
---
1) Yes, this started with the last patch
---
2) Hearthstone is the only Blizzard / Battle.net product I have in my mobile. PC seems to work well.
---
3) I can get into Battle.net and play Hearthstone normally in my PC. However, in mobile (Android) the same problem persists since the update, and until right now (just tested): it stops at the screen with the Hearthstone logo, and after a while, it goes to a "Closed" error screen with a message about how they're working on the "Good Cheer" card back issue.

You can see the attack in the log.

What gives you 20 gold

He didn't?
---
That happened to my opponent on turn 1 and 4 today. His first minion drew his deck and then he didn‚Äôt play anything till turn 4 and lost his hand.
---
That was a 200 IQ play. Now, all his cards cost 1!
---
TLDR: I still can't win any games, /ragequit

You assumed that he assumed that top hats and ties are for males because of internalized oppression.
