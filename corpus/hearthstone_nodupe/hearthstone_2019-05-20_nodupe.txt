Scar#2418, EU 80G q Trade, can go first!

---
---
that’s awesome haha
---
The difference is that zilliax will be a staple for a year and a half, whereas ragnaros would have been a staple for 5 years and running. Zilliax will eventually rotate naturally, but sylv and rag wouldn't, so they stepped in and did it manually.
---
Miskatonic#1372 on NA with the 80 gold quest.
---
Cast when drawn also draws another card to replace itself.
---
Provided you have a decent early game, you can win by just going coin 8/9 drop, fake coin fake coin, rinse repeat. On heroic his deck is basically a crappy version of tempo / thief rogue without any of the game finishers besides Tess, not to mention I don't think he has any form of removal. And if you are lucky enough to get lich king and Kel thuzard down you basically already won. Just watch out for eviscerate and vendetta on your Kel thuzard
---
I hope that in a few expansions times the Bartender is a boss that finally comes to collect his tab (because he’s always saying “I’ll put it on your tab!”).
---
I mean it’s the same between the first two wings right? Not that it’s certain there won’t be extra options, but you wouldn’t expect it
---
Sounds positib, tank yu.
---
Thanks! Makes way more sense than what I did - Malygos, Kalecgos, and then panic once I realized I could no longer time warp on the same turn anymore.
---

---
From there I played Thalnos and fireballed the Majordomo and passed. Boss didn't kill me, which let me kill with Rag/time warp.
---
I chose the random death knight hero power as a reward, and then set it up with the blackwald pixie
---
True but the first two wings were planned to release at the same time so if they were going to change something it would probably be in wing 3 or later
---
I instantly knew you did Toast's drawing too!
---
Yeah, wasn’t sure how an effect would stack and was bummed. Had the “Twinspell, Twinspell, Twinspell Deal 3 damage to all enemy minions” card and then reduced it’s cost by 3 for the rest of the run. Hoped the Twinspell copies would keep the cost reduction but they didn’t.
---
Was more referring to regular big priest. The wall variant doesn't look quite as good against control.
---
Steady on M8. 
---
Not all of us have your 200IQ level of genius with the game. We get our asses kicked a lot by galaxy brains like you. Don’t we deserve a place in HearthStone where we can kick some ass too?  Even if it is some stupid easy AI. 
---
Quit complaining and go beat the Lich King with Silverback Patriarchs and Goldshire Defenders or something that will challenge your considerable skillz; leave us idiots to have our fun.
---
not if you have robes + discount making them all 2 drops.
---
Although in fairness here two turns might’ve won the opponent the game depending on what cards are in his hand
---
Most games I am for free gameplay and only paying for cosmetic upgrades but I feel okay about paying for cards. I know that sounds bad but to me the game is still an alternative to MTG where you also have to buy  adds to win. You can actually play hearthstone F2P and many people do. 
---
I would never pay $10 for a skin. Or pay an extra $60 at the launch of an expansion just to get a skin. It doesn’t feel good.  I would rather have to play to unlock them if I really want them.
---
I’m not him, but for what it’s worth, Bomb hunter and Lackey rogue are high tier and faster than warrior and priest.
---
Neither did op yet you still complained about it
---
It hasnt happened because it isnt a problem. The only time bouncing elyssiana is a problem is when 2 people have decks built to do it. If your win con is "run your opponent out of stuff" then you are prepared for long games, and an hour and a half games is part of that territory. If your not planning to win in fatigue, then your deck should have a win con that beats a bounced elyssiana. If neither of these are true, you are playing a bad deck.
---
This. I sure as hell ain't picking robe for quest shaman/hunter.
---
Or to pick the first card
---
It's a testament to how much they don't want to change anything about the core game. Like the co op tavern brawls. "How can we make this work in our existing framework without having to create something new"
---
To be fair according to Firebat PNC just misplayed by not using the right sideboard.  Not that he didn't set up the right sideboard, just that he didn't use it correctly. He said that if PNC had used his deck with Mechanical Whelps in it, Firebat would've been far more likely to lose because only one of his decks has BGH in it.

I really hope we see something being done about Big Priest soon. The deck might just be tier 2, but it is incredibly unfun to play against, has oppressive matchups against many decks which are fun to play (basically anything that's not hyper aggro or combo) and even if you play a deck that's favorable against it, you can often enough still get highrolled by Barnes into some minion that's backbreaking for you.
---
I already really disliked the deck before this expansion, but Vargoth and Catrina both really pushed it again. Vargoth just has insane synergy with the deck and can often win on the spot, if you can't remove him. Catrina let's the game outlast other slow decks even more and tipped one or two previously winnable matchups more into Big Priest's favor (e.g. Jade Druid and Odd Warrior).
---
Reskinned cards probably not the best way to go. It doesn't change gameplay, and honestly that just raises the question of why reskins aren't an option in general.
---
But mixing and matching class cards is absolutely one way to go. Similarly, starting with unique Hero Powers is another way to go.
---
The difference between this and an entirely new class is that you have 30 cards and a single Hero Power to mess around with. It's not hundreds of cards that can be combined in practically infinite amounts of ways. So if your decklist by running Zayle has two unique cards, 28 collectable cards, and a unique Hero Power, there are *tons* of ways you can change it.
---
Most obviously, changing the unique cards or the Hero Power. But also swapping out any of the 28 collectable cards for *other* cards.
---
vvvv#11259  EU  80 gold quest trade  
---
i'll show and you go first
---
That's so good
---
Why there are wild cards on the table?
---
I managed it with a Tony on board.
---
Amazing. I think I lost some IQ points reading that
---
No you'd be coming in at a decent time.
---
There's two cards legal in Standard that can act as multiple complete decks viable for casual play.
---
Those are:
---
1. Whizbang the Wonderful
---
   1. He's from The Boomsday Project expansion from last year
---
   2. He'll cost sixteen hundred dust to craft
---
   3. When used, he'll give you one of the eighteen rotating pre-constructed decks
---
2. Zalye, Shadow Cloak
---
   1. He's from The Rise of Shadows expansion from April
---
   2. He'll also cost sixteen hundred dust to craft OR you can purchase the Great Dalaran Heist adventure for twenty dollars for a golden copy
---
   3. When used, he'll give you one of five decks made specifically for the card,
---
Its the exact opposite of what you said actually.
---
Rought day?!
---
Nah I replaced all my minions with Miscaller, had a stack of 25
---
Hilarious when I play my 8/8 minion and they swing their weapon into it three times, but I think it’s a big part of the reason people think the Grand Heist is the easiest single player expansion
---
Try hearthpwn
---
I had a run where I had a minion I buffed earlier appear. He got put in the deck with buffs.
---
gallywix is the easiest boss IMO
---
You can select if you wanna play with an anomaly at the start of the game( if you bought all wings already). They're symmetrical effects that affect the whole run.
---
With the passive that gives you a random death knight hp?
---
this was the worst deal EVER... OF ALL TIME...
---
It’s a known glitch with shifting scroll
---
Thanks
---
Reloading the game worked for me
---
Gotcha, I have anomaly mode but haven’t seen that one
---
First time he did anything, he turned my Sorc Apprentice into a Deathwing on 3.
---
Yeah... this one took me a really long time with lots of resets. I ended up getting 2 alarmobots and eventually took control of the board. Good luck OP. You are going to need it.
---
Mage was a nightmare IIRC.
---
Warlock destroy half the deck card could be good no? Anyway to force a draw of it?
---
No one tell him about fans.
---
the zayle decks are meant for people to experiment and have fun, i think blizzard intentionally stray from meta decks for people to try things they haven't tried before
---
Who are you and what have have you done to Bob?
---
ICC = Knights of the Frozen Throne?
---
saying "this is dalaran" doesn't make it feel like dalaran. so no. i stand by my statement that it feels half-baked and grafted on, and DOES NOT feel like it fits at all.
---
I saw nothing but good things from him from other players, so I was excited to give him a go.
---
He filled my hand with Eurekas on turn one.
---
Traitorous swine.
---
Should have made it available the first week when it was usable
---
Right, what's up with that line? I'm clearly paying immediately.
---
That's not a buff though, a buff is only temporary and will make their stats go green. The added stats from bartender change the minion itself as the default (if its silent it doesn't revert)
---
I saw this on Twitter. Great job!
---
If it's copying a game it's Dream quest, just like StP btw. You know Dream Quest, right? Peter Whalens game?
---
[removed]
---
No he has his own lines and voice but i didn't remember exactly what it was
---
It sounds like Big Warrior. You can find Fibonacci playing that deck on his stream.
---
You can't because you can only play 2 cards each turn you murloc.
---
Well, what did you expect? Imagine Dadgar and the other archmages sitting around the crystal ball laughing their asses off when somebody messing with the bank actually starts to rely on a magic item that they control. How long are they going to lead you on before making you spontaneously combust? Honestly, it depends on whether crazy man Vargoth is in the room.
---
Nothing is more demoralizing than having your win condition obliterated on turn six.
---
They aren’t copies then.
---
The Hearthstone team (not Blizzard because WoW is a different story) have been *very* consistent in this regard - they want 'grindy' mechanics kept to a minimum.  That's why all our daily reward is front-loaded and the reward for winning each game is low.  That's why we don't have achievements.  That's why we don't have lots of things to 'unlock' even though they would be an easy win and would make the community happy in the short term.  That's why when they do giveaways, they usually just give us something, or make it so we just click a button and wait (e.g. choose your champion) they don't gate it behind any kind of gameplay.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Whether you or I agree with that philosophy or not is another issue, but there is definitely consistency here.
---
I had a run where for a single game after the tavern they had the buff. I think it may just be bugged.
---
I'm actually sitting on 8-8 with Zayle decks at rank 2 so they can't be that bad. A few cards that I wouldn't choose but honestly i'm impressed by them.
---
They can at least make the HP work. I wanna see Jarraxus back in the meta again
---
Not happening to me either. I’m on an iPhone on iOS 12.2.
---
The cards are definitely comparable. If you have a hand full of minions for example.. These cards effect you in the exact same way despite having completely different wording.
---
\*surprise motherf\*cker\*
---
my favourite part about specialist : they wanted sideboarding but were to small indie company to make an interface for it. That is how this thing came to be
---
5 decks: Silence Priest, Plot Twist Lock, Bomb Warrior, Tempo Rogue and Control Shaman
---
Having them be a reward from the Dalaran heist isn't "giving them out for free".
---
If they'd go "Complete every wing in heroic with mage" to give you the mage skin, that would be completely justified. It would also make more people buy the other wings. Which are currently stupidly overpriced in gold (the USD price is fine imho).
---
One and done
---
"Beat every wing in heroic with the warlock henchman"
---
That would be difficult, but also obtainable, and themed for Rafaam.
---

yeah they’re gone from when he switched over to magic arena entirely. quite sad, i loved his old talkstone videos
---
This doesn't need a solution. The class name is right there when the game starts. Also, if you can't even deduce the hero from their hero power, you won't be in a disadvantage because you don't know which hero you're up against.
---
Need a new emote imho.  "shut the fuck up" and it auto-squelches.
---
Yeah, he’s still a demon.
---
But that wasn't the point. The point was.. The OP saw this similarity in the cards and the situation where this could arise. Therefore he made the post. It wasn't hard to see the situation and enjoy it for what it was. Instead of nitpicking the shit out of it and over analyzing it. It's obviously not hard to see how the cards could be compared or what the OP was getting at when he posted these.  If it took you longer to realize the connection than most than that's a you problem.. Not a me problem.. Some of us are just faster thinkers than others.
---
2 twisting nethers and 2 dooms IIRC.
---
It was constantly clearing my board after playing it very carefull to remove any poison he had :(
---
Thanks for the reply :) nice to hear it’s harder on heroic
---
followed by HEX.
---
^(Kappa)
---
&gt;Tempo is exactly about how much board advantage you get out of your mana
---
Except its not. Tempo is, by definition, your short term control of the game. You could have 90 mana worth of shit out, if your opponent has a million armor, which literally doesn't effect the board at all, he still has tempo because he is still in control of the match.
---
https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Tempo
---
&gt;The momentum of the match. Probably the original definition and among many unofficially accepted "right" ones. However, its imprecision can lead to misunderstandings and odd interpretations causing confusion in discussion.
---
"Momentum" not "board presence" or "mana efficiency".
---
It definitely becomes a much fairer card with that change.
---
Can I just get a "Good luck" emote? It whould bring me much joy for many moons
---
Yes if they are fun and interactive
---
dmh was an older deck. basically you have unlimited cards and armor, you keep shuffling your hand which has another shuffle and armor gain card, you get infinite shuffles. you win in fatigue. i think it was before rastakhan.
---
Its good in quest hunter. You have a lot of draw. Use after quest completion. I had permanent stealth so it was easy.
---
Sorry to intervene, but u/stonekeep is right and you are wrong. your example with kokron is 100% a tempo loss and the dragonhatcher example is just weird and doesnt make any sense in the context of your discussion.  
---
to add, mana efficiency is something completely different. you can have highly mana efficient plays that bring little to no tempo and you can have very mana inefficient plays that are high tempo.
---
Np enjoy the deck is really fun to play :)
---
I would actually be fine with it if they gave it the "twinspell" treatment.
---
What do you mean? I dont understand the title. But wow that looks like a free win
---
Tempo is not unique to hearthstone, and it will always mean "the momentum of the match".
---
Pressuring your opponent is tempo. It gains momentum. Your 'short term control of the match' is increased by lowering your opponents health to a degree where they have to deal with that. 
---
Waggle picking face twice is a good tempo play.
---
Getting similar buckets in a row is good in a lot of case though. A lot of time it would have synergy with each other e.g. A lot of battlecry minions.
---
Jokes on you, that was a girl.
---
Name me one class other than Rogue that can actually play, bounce, and replay Leeroy in the same turn.
---
I personally can attest that 2/2 buff was not applied to copies for me.
---
Outside of Rogue, this change generally makes the card better.
---
Hesutu thought he mastered the power of the winds by granting windfury to minions, only to be bested by a masterful machine's mega-windfury.
---
Here it *cooooooomes!*
---
Why would you combine those two treasures tho?
---
Pulls a doomsayer
---
Golden Candle carried me through Heroic Hunter, playing the Quest and lots of tiny dudes with +1/+1. The bosses decks are heavily synergized to their hero power. When you take that away and they have to play random ass legendaries for full mana cost, suddenly theyre not so hard anymore.
---
No board clears, no spells, no healing, in most cases. Flood the board with little things, clear their shit, pop the Candle in have a full board of legendaries while the boss has no way to come back in almost any case.
---
The Golden Candle is great in the right deck.
---
On the upside, you will have 80 coins to play next turn. On the other, you have no cards that do anything really and can never draw cards again.
---
The way I look at it is this - if the next PvE module is amazing, I will be content with just doing the 45 heroic runs to complete every wing with every Hero in Dalaran.
---
But if the next PvE module isn't great or is something with low replay value like a "traditional" adventure, I will be happy to have a goal to come back to Dalaran. I already still have a lot of fun TBH - playing random dungeons with classes isn't perfect (Mage's algorithm needs a little help IMO, but Hunter and Shaman have solid random decks) but it's a challenge to do after knocking out the run with the best hero power / deck combo on offer for each class.
---
He Turned My kalecgos into 3 mana And cleared The board when My opponent had lethal so in conclusion khadgars helpful advice kinda op
---
Yeah, after I picked that treasure I just picked buckets with the most expensive cards I could find.  
---
That let me control board hard enough I could just play 2 coins and pass or a single coin and a card I wanted.  Actually was pretty easy all things considered.
---
True. I stopped at TBC, always forget about expanded Horde.
---
Got a 0 mana Alexstrasza in a spell hunter type deck with Malygos, that was fun.
---
You have to pay for them.
---
If Wisdomball decides to recast a secret or quest, instead the next spell you play will be cast again. Did you play secret or quest that appeared to be double cast prior to playing Geddon? (maybe the turn before that)
---
I think completing every chapter with every class in normal and heroic will be more then enough for me since it'll need to complete 90 runs to do so, but there being so much content for completionists is pretty cool :D
---
I got leeroy jenkins earlier today
---
Stop, stop! He's already dead.
---
It isn't a waste if you're having fun
---
You got clear your board so it can become a 66563/66563. Think of the VALUE!
---
I mean its okay still a little expensive, but i guess i can see a little value in that.
---
Millhouse berates you and asks to be put back in your hand.
---
fuck fuck fuck
---
Rez Priest, Wall priest, big priest. In my rank (10-5) it's honestly the deck that tilts me the most and feels impossible to win against.  I know what you mean, I prefer some type of mid-range, control decks over aggro and overall passive decks. With priest it frustrates me the most b/c there is potential for a lot of diff things but sadly its all passive play.
---
Yeah cuz she is Mallie.. Magni is the warrior hero, so Magnificent couldn't be used here.
---
I literally never think about my cardback and didn't even notice I'm using the Hakkar cardback until I saw this post.
---
Update: took Nat Pagle, went 8 wins w a control mage, stuck pagle on 2 decent few times to out-value. Felt v memey, I loved it
---
Alexstraza gives you an instant  8/8 jaraxus gives you a mediocre weapon.
---
A slower warlock may work if at least his health could be buffed. It would’ve been cool to see a C’thuns chosen type of card but for Jaraxxus added to classic warlock instead of 1 mana random demon
---
When we got the packs at the rotation, I got an excellent good bye from Un'goro with a golden "The caverns below" and a "Clutchmother Zavas" I got a little emotional :')
---
Big Priest does have a fairly easy gameplan, but what really separates those who know how to play the deck and those who can't is the aggressive match-up. It's easy to pile on a ton of big bodies when you're opponent only reacts to you, but when shoved onto their back foot with a more proactive opponent, the deck can very easily end up struggling.
---
Un'Goro Silence Priest also had a simple gameplan, as most Midrange decks also have, but that deck did have quite a bit of nuance from what I can remember. Most of the wins I can remember having with the deck were "just in time" sort of wins where I finally saw an opening and if I didn't take it now, my opportunity would make winning impossible otherwise.
---
Most Priest decks can be considered easy to learn, difficult to master.
---
So maybe nerf more than 1?
---
Anomaly: Reductive is an Anomaly that reduces your cards by one every turn. So you can play everything you have on turn 4. it's better than Scepter or Cape. 
---
Crystal Gem starts with 2 Mana, it has lots of good early es well. So yes, it's greedy - but planned greedy.
---
I was picking Deathrattle stacks.
---
Fuck this librarian.
---
Seems like a natural fit!  Also keep in mind you can heal face before using it, or use your hero power after it's played to deal an additional 2 damage.  Wild Pyro can be combo'd with your deck to clear sticky soul of the forest boards.
---
Honestly, I'm pretty sure Blizzard does as well.
---
Like this?
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/QRgQrJT  
---
As i've said tavern buffs don't work as you'd expect them to.
---
Wrong link?
---
Could still lose. I hit a 0 Mana deathstalker rexxar then never drew him and lost at 7
---
I got whooshed, I admit it.
---
Nothing I can post on reddit, but there are people who are already aware of these changes. Honestly surprised they hadn't previously been posted, so that's why I put them up
---
He's a troll, nothing that he says is true.
---
Honey I'm still free,
---
“I’ve adjusted the cost of that for you!”
---
Echo spell now 9 cost
---
Small indie company 
---
Nice spaghet code lol
---
Yes!
---
 I can hear the wow emotes
---
It was pretty damn hard to play properly though.
---
&gt;Millhouse turn 2 can be actually good.
---
Famous last words
---
I had a deck with Witch's Brew and Unstable Evolution, while my spells costed health instead of mana.
---
Honestly, these are all pretty minor changes. I don't see them hurting the viability of Rogue too much. 4 health on lackey is still very good for a 3-cost card that gives you two lackeys.
---
Prep is the biggest change, but I don't know if it is going to be high impact, because the most common prep targets were low-cost spells.
---
Which effectively means that every rogue spell got nerfed, but you have a decision on which card it applies to each game. It can be treated as a passive effect when looking at a game as a whole, instead of on a particular turn.
---
prep is a hit to big rouge :/
---
I like that prep was “tuned” down rather than just gutted or banished to wild. It’s an interesting card that creates a lot of gameplay decisions.
---
Havent crafted a deck for a year and just when I make Nomi rogue it gets nerfed..
---
Yes, but Rogue was the counter to Warrior's hard counters. Warrior is fucked if Midrange Hunter becomes popular.
---
I hope dude. That was my only way to climb. I also had a thief rogue with which i climbed to 6. But i got super lucky
---
I've mained control shaman for the past month and have never played shudderwock after elysiana. Doing so randomizes my deck and makes winning late games too inconsistent. In order, I throw down hagatha, giggling, shudderwock, elysiana, baleful as to preserve my advantage as much as possible.
---
&gt; On one hand you have horrible spells like wanted! That are just overcosted by 3
---
You cannot be serious. Do you seriously think Wanted! is overcosted by 3? It's overcosted by 1-1.5 mana at most.
---
Rip rogue
---
Exodia mage is nazi
---
Not going to take anything away from Boom's strength, but in the end people mostly played Warrior to beat Rogues. It was already showing that against other decks, Warrior had more difficulties, even with Dr. OP around (Conjurer Mage does fine, midrange hunter too).  
---
So this can go 2 ways, either people will move away from Warrior because of the lack of Rogues on ladder, or Warriors will continue to play their favorite doctor and tech more against these midrange decks, which might lead to something new popping up etc. etc.  
---
Nerfing Rogue might just get the ball rolling by itself.
---
I did not expect to see EM, Prep, and RP all get nerfed O\_O
---
Well I guess I'm done with Hearthstone. I keep hoping Blizzard was not sutpid enough to nerf Prep, they weren't.
---
I'm with you on this, though I have only one golden prep.
---
 
---
Free dust though.
---
Right?  Run banker, keep coin.  Insta win in mirror.
---
Then for consistency they should remove the stupid sac pact interaction.
---
lol Rogue mains. Hate to see it.
---
It'll still get that pressure from token druid.
---
People are just going to stop playing brews and bankers. No deck builder worth their salt is going to keep a card in their deck that is only good in the mirror, 50% of the time, and requires saving one of the most powerful tools in Hearthstone until the very end of the game.
---
Welp time to get dust from golden raiding party. Maybe prep, but prep can still serve some purpose
---
Everyone keeps saying that but do they really believe that? Has anyone not seen the best card in the game Dr Boom in action? Couple that with almost endless board clears and Omega devastators and no one can do anything against them
---
At least druids got to have fun for like 45 years before they even thought about netting it.
---
I think that may be the first time I actually like all of the balance changes coming in a single update. We'll played, Blizzard
---
Preparation FINALLY. To bad I didn't have more copies to dust.
---
Some insight:
---
First sorry that the image isn't the best at actually explaining the otk, but it was the only one I had and I wanted to share.
---
How it works:
---
Solo Adventure: Monster Hunt.
---
Boss hero power: All spells have echo.
---
If you use Scavenge when no spells have been played you get a 0 mana, deal 1 damage 'Small Rock' spell.
---
0 mana, deal 1, damage, echo, turns out it's pretty good!
---
At least Jade Idol would be stronger and stronger towards the end.
---
i understand the stealth minion line - i dont understand the jungle panther line.
---
if rogue is your largest worry you wait one mana and slap down half time scav for a much beefier body and armor gain and then better conjurer call.
---
personally id prefer hench clan sneak if it needs to be a three drop because having somethings stick after trading for a conjurers call matters more to me than dealing one extra - especially if its to hit rogue
---
In mirror?  You'd been insane not to.
---
The classic use for Prep was always sprint though, in the past. And so many "Wild" cards get so much worse with the prep change.
---
Yea I wonder if current meta tempo rogues will lean more heavily into nomi now, since prep/Myra’s into nomi can still happen with 10 mana.
---
Par for the course on missing the point
---
Riight  Archivist was strong because it cost 8 mana...
---
The Lich king was in a pub in Dalaran, waiting to join up with a fat kobold in my timeline.
---
I'm mad.
---
I like all of these changes, but I think waggle pick might be the biggest issue.
---
most of the time they are really designed for the tournament setting. that setting is different from ladder. you can try it but you will most likely have to make adjustments.
---
RIP Rogue.
---
Warrior had the Waraxe which was a big deal
---
Well, glad I got a free Golden Elysiana.
---
Or a 1 damage nerf to waggle pick to prevent the dread corsair plays on turn 4. I would have rather seen that than the prep nerf.
---
As always destroying the core set is the way to go, instead of finding a different system and actually letting people play their old decks.
---
There is no way that deck beats a big priest without playing the quest. BP is actually a very good matchup for a Miracle Mage, because you have ample time to amass combo pieces.
---
And just as a side note, that's not a big priest.
---
If the meta is 50% Warriors (which is might be after Rogue dies...) then yes, people will keep bankers.  Maybe not brew, but banker still works.
---
Prep has been causing balance and design problems the entire time the game has been out, it’s had it coming forever. I wished they’d hall of famed it instead of nerfing, and I still hope they rotate it anyway at the end of the year, but this card has always been insane. Raiding Party is only broken because it has Prep backing it up and at the moment Prep is only broken because of Party but it’s also broken other cards in the past and will on the future if it wasn’t changed.
---
Why am I not seeing Barnes here?
---
Problem is when the Mecha'thun package is very good, people will most definitely tech for it. I played a ton of Mecha'thun Warrior during RR (around 150 games) when it was considered a meme deck but still ran a 70% WR with it because the deck was non-existant on ladder and practically no one I ever queued in to understood how to play against it, when the rotation hit I tried it again and found myself struggling in some matchups because people were running Hecklebots, Saboteurs etc in their combo decks purely to stop that combo.
---
Obviously I'm purely speculating, but I really don't see it becoming a menace to the upcoming meta shift.
---
##DIE INSECT
---
##LIVE INSECT
---
In WoW it's Millificent.
---
You realize the card you're describing is not Boom right?
---
Rogue getting the Druid treatment. So Rogue had a busted deck for 5 or 6 weeks and instead of nerfing the deck they nerf the class. Such a ridiculous overreaction.
---
I think thats a huge overreaction.
---
Prep is still a good card, it's a conditional innervate (a card which has seen play since its nerf) that is better than innervate when its condition is met, so long as combo is a word printed on cards then a 0 mana spell that does anything will see play.
---
Raiding party will probably be cut from lists but there's still plenty of things for rogues to replace the pirate package with.
---
Miscreant is still the best rogue card and still one of the best cards of the expansion, I'd expect to see most rogues transition to lackey based spirit of the shark lists which have already seen success.
---
!remindme 2 days
---
I hate hate hate the prep change, now all rogue spells are basicly overcosted by 1. ANd they shoudl stop nerfing and gutting classic and basic cards.  
---
 raidng party nerf alone was more then enough escpially combined with miscreant, but no prep aswlel adn nerfed evry single rogue spell in the entire game. If you know prep would be issue in standar,d you should have hof’d it. Then atleast would be playable in wild,which is for old cards but aslo not casue you nerf all core (classic and basic) cards.  
---
 I dont think ive ever been more upset about a nerf.
---
Sorry but this is horrible,thats not how you nerf a class.  
---
 And blizz just rotate all classic and basic again,and unerf it all and make a new set to rotate in so will sotp being a issue and you can stop screwing over both formats for ever with nerfs to classic and basic. non rotating set for standard was a mistake from teh start.
---
Sorry but Fck that Change.
---
rogue was to good at moment, yes but you dont need to screw classes forever by nerfing classic and basic cards,espcially as core ones for entire class as preperation.  
---
 its like  baku and genn again. Nerfing others cards instead of ones causing issue and ruinign classic over time.  
---
 really whats point of classic if youre slowly gutting it all anyway.
---
Also could we maybe get a evrything unerfed format? so people can stop caring abotu the horrible nerfs escpially to classic and basic.
---
Really nerfing preperation is a big mistake, evry spell was balanced around it, and raiding needed a nerf which i got, double even. 
---
Now you destroyed any hope for sprint and others to see any play in wild or standard.
---
Ouch, Preparation. That is one of the most key rogue cards since the inception of the game. That one hurts.
---
I think he was referring to the fact that she's actually named Millificient.
---
They aren't gonna put a bounce in their deck for a situation that comes up in like 5 per cent of games
---
Ah shit, here we go again
---
This guy gets it. We just want boom nerfed so a 4 mana omega devastator isnt a remove 2 minions with a body. It can still be remove 1 minion but not 2 because of the rush. Combine that with the fact you can discover even more just strengthens my argument
---
&gt;wanted! That are just overcosted by 3
---
By, like, 1.
---
I'm still salty about the Wild Growth nerf.  The problem cards have rotated and the card isn't even played in Wild.  Wish they'd just fucking revert the nerf because at this point between that and this Prep nerf they've made me glad I didn't spend any money this expac.  I think I'll probably quit if the next expansion doesn't give Druid something more fun than token druid to play.
---
Mage gets dicked by hunter, hunter gets dicked by rogue, rogue got nerfed?
---
Meanwhile warriors breathe a sigh of relief.
---
Hopefully that pushes rogue towards a more rewarding midrange tempo deck, utilising all the great tools for a build like that which went unused because of the sheer efficiency of the face-plan.
---
Underbelly Fence, Vendetta, hench Clan Burglar, Togwaggle, Scheme, Spirit of the Shark, all of these tools rarely or never get used but maybe without the prep raiding party miscrent, coin prep something edwin and just straight up waggle into greenskin into leeroy vs no weapon removal highroll something like this will become playable.
---
Another nerf to a classic card that has existed for 5 years?
---
Come on ..   
---
And these other cards .. dont they playtest? Anyone can see how powerful Evil Miscreant and Raiding party would be ...   
---
But really Raiding party is only broken because of WAGGLE pick .. why not nerf Waggle Pick to 3 power?  
---
Why 3 Rogue nerfs .. and ZERO to Warrior after having nothing but Warrior v Warrior mirror matches all weekend in the GrandMasters?
---
they need o have seperat balance for standard and wild, ton of nerfed cards would 100% fine in wild. and need a evrything unerfed format aswell,would be unbalanced mess most likly but atleast is no fear of blizz gutting cards for eternity or classes.
---
Except for all their spells that cost 2 or less which is most of them
---
Nobody is going to play banker / brewmaster specifically for one mirror match and only if you get the coin in that specific mirror match.

Not saying mechathun decks are bad, just saying I doubt they will become too ubiquitous, especially now that most decks just freed up two tech slots.
---
And regardless, a mechathun mirror is bound to be more stimulating than a double elysiana one.
---
Objectively, I understand that prep was a problematic card, and has always been overpowered. As a rogue main and 5-year HS veteran, this hurts so much. So many meme decks just died, so much ability to revisit okd favorites just died. This is overwhelmingly the biggest nerf announced.
---
Jade Idols didn't lead to as many draws. Multiple Elysianas was kind of making hosting tournaments a bit of pain because of the control warrior mirror. The mirror goes to the turn-limit a lot.
---
I think I've had more games go to the turn-limit this expansion then the rest of the expansions combined. 
---
That being said I don't think her playability is effected too much by being nerfed to 9, you didn't want to run the banker anyway, you just had to if other people did.
---
In Specialist format they definitely will.  I already am seeing Pro's like Bunnyhoppor complain that it isn't 10 mana.  50% chance to win the game with coin is still high enough to run a bouncer.
---
If you double click on the text it goes away. On mobile if you swipe it, it goes away
---
Bokkie#21695, EU, Trade only, I can show you, but you go first.
---
You aren't going to play a bad 2 drop just for its utility in one specific matchup 50% of the time.
---
raiding alone was enough,prep shouldve been hof'd.
---
Yeah, I dunno why people are complaining about this - Prep has always been kind of a problem card, like many cards that enable you to cheat out mana in Hearthstone. Since Innervate was nerfed, I honestly don't know why they waited this long for Prep.
---
You can still bounce \[\[Omega devastator\]\] which is OK since most of the time it means you remove at least 2 minions with a best case of 4 if you can rush it into 2 small things
---
But if they waste Hemet on your first Patriarch, you can play the 2nd one and win the game, since they're out of removal!
---
Wild players rejoice! /s
---
Prep + Backstab is such a good combo
---
Mage is the new deck to beat. Rogue kept it in check.
---
I think we'll see Mage, it's such a strong class that's still being refined. It has a much easier time vs fast Hunter and Shaman decks than it did vs Rogue. 
---
With these nerfs Conjurer's Calling is now the best card in the set by far.
---
I don’t like that Prep is getting hit because of Raiding Party but dropping it to (2) doesn’t kill it. Eviscerate, Sap, Cold Blood, Deadly Poison: Prep into any of those is not changed so it’s a nerf more to expensive Rogue spells that weren’t seeing a lot of play anyway.
---
Prep is still OG Innervate. That’s a pretty good card.

They probably won't be running a bouncer anymore. But if, for whatever reason (e.g. good battlecry options next expansion), they decide to run it again, then a mirror match will be decided on who goes first, and that seems like bad design.

Nerfing rogue without touching conjuring's calling or mage in general was a mistake
---
Secret hunter was to beat rogue. So idk what you’re talking about
---
It's still strong, but if you want to have multiple archivists, you have to go 2nd and save the coin until fatigue... or play shaman.  It was only ever good in mirror matches and now it's at least not a practically  guaranteed draw in control warrior mirror.
---
Now I can’t turn 1 Espionage anymore...
---
How can I get Ultimate Infestation turn 2 then !
---
But EVIL miscreant has 3 1-attack body, which synergizes a whole lot with Hobgoblin.
---
maybe, but class was build around, you dont nerf that and not change all other spells. this leaves the class lot worse of for eternity.
---
It’s literally irrelevant.
---
Elysiana now reads in mirror matches: if you have a coin, win the game.
---
Are you kidding? I only beat mages. Can't remember the last time I lost to one as bomb/mech hunter. You should reevaluate how you play the matchup
---
I kind of doubt players will run the bounce just for the 50% chance of saving coin, I mean more power to them if they want to I guess.
---
I think all it needs is omega devastator nerfed to 6 damage. Still a good removal option but can’t get though something thicc
---
Good, she's boring as hell compared to those two.
---
Hardly. I predict that the meta will overcorrect at first and rogue will be somewhat rare, but by the end of the expansion rogue will return to at least tier 2 but in a different form. I could be totally wrong on this but that is my feeling. And now that prep has been changed, I'm sure they will design future rogue spells with that in mind.
---
1/4 is still really good for Miscreant, but thank god there's no more prep+RP+EM on 3 shenanigans.
---
you can still win with chef Nomi :D
---
So bad you just can’t stop telling everyone what you still think about it, hunh?
---
Could be worse, you could be a Drui.... RIP
---
I crafted Myra's yesterday. I own 3 Edwins. WHYYYYYYYYYYYY
---
You’ll be fine, I promise
---
Secret Hunter right now is actually disgusting. much control,  many damage
---
im on the jungle panther train after just reading the nerf announcement where miscreant is now a 1/4 and yeah the curve makes sense. i havent put a tonne into dragon-conjurer ive been messing with low-spell conjurer instead
---
 [https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/22990356](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/22990356)  nerfs by the way
---
Really don’t get it why would blizzard nerf classic cards. Worked for years, but now a deck containing it is overpovered so let’s nerf it. Ridiculous...
---
This is retarded, instead of nerfing the "new" cards which made the meta like this, you decide to nerf a Classic card like Preparation?
---
Nerf the fucking 4/2 weapon which deserves to be at least 5 mana.
---
And no nerfs to Dr Boom, Dyn-o-matic or omega devastator which are not fair?
---
Really lame job.
---
minor? minor?! nerfing evry rogue spells or ever and all execing rogue spells and leaving class of lot worse forever is minor?
---
That's until they Waggle Pick their Hemet. Silverback Patriarch is just too weak in this Hemet meta.
---
Sooooooo no warrior or hunter nerf?
---
My own proposed nerfs were:
---
-Raiding party to 4 mana
---
-VanCleef to 4 mana
---
-Elysianna to 10 mana
---
-Boom Hero loses rush on mechs
---
Fan of Knives isn't exactly overcosted, compared to arcane explosion or shiv. Sprint is overcosted now though.
---
This, but nicer OP.
---
In your opinion
---
20 mana would be excessive.
---
Are (or is?!) Mage decks going to have a chance to rise ?
---
I mean keleseth rogue never even ran prep and it was the best deck in the game for an entire exp.
---
I think rogue is gonna be OKAY
---
The nerfs seem pretty reasonable imo.
---
At least until they do the same to other classes, HOPEFULLY.
---
everything opened/end of season rewards
---
How many games has this interaction ever mattered in?
---
The nerfs to Evil Miscreant makes me real happy as a hunter player.
---
The new 1-4 Body now dies to Snipe, Marked Shot and Huffer. 
---
Timber wolf + Unleash the Hounds also only takes 2 tokens to trade off miscreant post-nerf instead of 3 hounds.
---
Imagine still playing Control Warrior when you can just play Shudderwock Shaman.
---
Next spell you cast costing 3 less mana is nowhere near as good as just gaining 3 mana.
---
Yes but you’ll also destroy the golden prep
---
1600
---
Consistency?!?! Are you high?
---
Or you know just use thaurission.
---
This solo adventure came out a year ago. I think it's safe to say that EVERYONE knows about this interaction already
---
Every single time rogue becomes relevant, it gets nerfed to the ground. (See rogue quest, which got nerfed TWICE. The first one was sort of fair, the second one was bs).
---
As someone who has been playing rogue for fun for many years, seeing how they gut it like this, while leaving everyone else intact, is quite sad. 
---
This is not only a nerf to rogues, but a buff to the rest of the decks that struggled against rogue and weren’t doing bad.
---
JeanPeuplus#2341 for trading 80g quest on EU.
---
I've been playing this game since launch and this joke never gets old.
---
Still confused.  Instead of crafting golden preps, you waited to pull both?
---
But a nerf to Tempo Rogue shifts the meta far beyond that. Here are some examples: 
---
Tempo Rogue is really favorable against hunters. Hunters are favorable against Warrior. A decrease in Tempo Rogue means an increase in hunters on ladder, which would mean less favorable matchups for Warrior on ladder.
---
Rogue also dominates Khadgar Mage, which Warrior also has an unfavorable matchup against. Apply the same logic here, and once again, Control Warrior has worse matchups.
---
Mech Paladin is another example. Rogue's instant dip in popularity after this will definitely make a splash in the meta that damages Warrior indirectly on several fronts.
---
Nice my only deck right now one card already hurt but 3 of it lol
---
I'm sorry your thought-out predictions are buried under my low score comment hah
---
I'm not exactly sure if that's how it's gonna go, but at the same time - I'm no expert. Surely though, control decks are going to be much more prevalent after these nerfs. This hurts me as a F2P player :(
---
The micro bots would still need rush though
---
Self promotion here. Just trying to see if I am worth watching. Two time legend player on the grind to make friends
---
Wow, I just wanna quit now. I just started playing and JUST made a competetive rogue deck then this happens. Awesome. Fucking unplayable now,
---
Preparation has been a problem card since Hearthstone's inception.
---
Haha, going to play banker just incase of a mirror match. Not only that, then its 50/50 if you get a coin or not. Then fill up one slot in your hand with a card for 30 turns. Riiiiiiiiiiiiight.
---
I'm just planning on doing a Starter account to get a feel for the game again. Definitely not aiming to play retail, I'm hyped for classic!
---
Hunter gets dicked by Token druid and to a lesser extent Murloc Shaman
---
Huge advantage on the coin in the mirror. And in the games where you aren’t on the coin, Banker/Brewmaster are still some what useful.
---
yeah i heard that statement. i repeat. Too powerful in combination with raiding party.
---
Pacoon#1101 - NA - 80g Quest Trade - Online Now!
---
I can't believe Boom wasn't nerfed. Okay, so nerfing rogue apparently will make warrior appear less, that doesn't make Boom any less of an overtuned and incredibly frustrating card to play against.
---
&gt; I don't understand why people were crying about "Infinite" (max 3) Elysianas.
---
Tournaments were taking 12-14 hours due to everyone waiting for Warrior vs Warrior games to finish.
---
I clicked the play button, but it shows the loading screen, then a text pops up saying that an error occurred
---
The prep nerf has been warranted since the game launched with that mindless miracle rogue deck.
---
I think the class' tempo archetype is dead this expansion, because losing the prep/raiding party combo and its synergy with Edwin will probably bring down Rogue's overall winrate something like 10%. 
---
They're losing their tempo cards, and lackey decks are all about tempo. What they're left with is too fair and slow to close the game against control decks.
---
Rogue will have to rely on their card generation and stealing mechanics to try and out value other decks.
---
Seriously fuck prep vanish.
---
The problem of the change is , in pro scene, Warrior mirror is almost certain lost if you go first.
---
**Preparation really hurts for Rogue.**
---
Edit: It's another reminder what Kibler said - silently nerfing all classic cards one by one seems the solution for Blizzard.
---
Other changes are ok I guess.
---
If you just nerfed Devastator, everything you described goes away.
---
not a great time, happy friendly bot.
---
The main reason they were *so* rampant though was because of the rogue matchup. With rogue becoming less popular, decks like hunter and mage, which prey on warrior, become more popular. That's bad for warrior.
---
How exactly can you nerf the deck without nerfing the class as a result? 
---
Tempo Rogue as an archetype has been playing the same core from the classic and basic sets (Prep, Sap, SI7, Eviscerate, Edwin, Backstab, Leeroy, and formerly Cold Blood with cards like Fan of Knives, Deadly Poison, and Southseas Deckhand coming in and out depending on what recent expansions bring) since the archetype's inception. The archetype has also been consistently playable in one form or another since at least Knights of the Frozen Throne format.
---
Prep should have been Hall of Famed. Every Rogue spell that cost 3 or more was nerfed.
---
Knowing how much you love rogue, this must be rough. Sorry bro
---
Are you braindead?  Everyone knows this. 
---
Also the Line from Bob. 
---
"You don't need to go home, but you can't stay here" is from the movie "Blues Brothers" after their gig in this country bar.

His list doesnt run prep or raiding party.
---
They addressed this: 
---
&gt; Currently, if you want to build a deck that is strong against Rogue, you have just one reasonable option: Warrior. If you compare Rogue to Warrior, however, you’ll find that the latter class has a wide variety of good and bad matchups, which makes it unlikely that it’ll overtake Rogue in popularity in the current meta.
---
Grandmasters had so many Warriors because the pros knew it was their only hope if the other players picked Rogue.
---
And because there’s gonna be less rogues, just lose to mage and hunter even more with dead cards... interesting choice
---
The (4) is actually a really good analysis, the bounce effect was rarely relevant and the real power of the card is that it gives you more turns with a buffed hero power (and passive effect that gives rush to your mechs). The fact that you might get 20 turns instead of 10 isn't relevant against the other classes so basically what they've done is that the warrior mirrors are going to be shorter and the warriors decks are going to be slightly stronger against other classes... What did they want in the first place? Less warriors? And you make a nerf that's only relevant in a warrior mirror... great!
---
I haven't touched rogue in a while, but maybe the old hooktusk package is worth revisiting? It did not run raiding party or prep, so assuming it can fill in the gaps left by the "midrange package" rotating out, it might still be competitive.
---
Maybe try out some of the free ones like dungeon run and stuff first to see how you like those. It's pretty similar to those, just expanded a bit and with some different options. If you just started, I think you need to go to the store and "buy" those for $0 for them to show up (monster hunt and dungeon run).
---
Exactly. Rogues played Counterfeit Coin when that was a thing.
---
It still cripples miracle decks that use it.
---
Yeah, but not more than 50% of the time, which is bad.
---
The reason Warrior has been popular lately is because Rogue has been the driving force behind the meta. Warrior has been the one solid counter facing Rogue, and Rogue is popular, so Warrior has been good. So a nerf to Rogue means that other classes that Warrior *isn't* as good against will become popular, which is bad for Warrior. Or at least Warrior as it exists now.
---
2 cards, 0 mana draw 3 &gt; 2 cards, 2 mana draw 3  
---
That entire rogue list is dead.
---
It is insane how many people think that people will run bouncer now. Mechathun is the new way imo
---
But the opposite is also true. If you were to build a heavier rogue counter by adding some heals/taunts to your deck you're bound to lose to warrior. It's impossible to compete with the value of that deck short of Dire Frenzy.
---
Maybe it's just me, but I guessed that new wings would bring new interactions... I hope I'm right
---
I'm so happy that all the Rogues are totally screaming in agony, thank god.
---
More importantly, this allows Warrior to still have 1 mana left over for Shield Slam or Omega Assembly.
---
I think Mechathun Warrior and Elysianna Bomb warrior will be the only warrior lists that are popular
---
They mentioned longevity for the game, but it seems like every other  patch Rogue is getting another classic card nerfed after new cards come in.
---
Betrayal, Blade Flurry, Conceal, Cold Blood, and now Prep. Rogue is getting the shaft.
---
lul he could seance and magnetize that
---
Just when I crafted 2x Waggle Pick. Well, atleast I get dust back for it.
---
Wait...
---
They could have just nerfed this and let the other cards alone.
---
Now the shaman wins
---
can I see your list? this sounds fun
---
Definitely not autowin, just favorable.
---
It should go live on Wednesday.
---
People seem to be overreacting quite a bit.
---
Rogues without prep have not only existing before but have been the best deck in the game (tempo rogue with keleseth...).
---
Rogue has eternally had the best classic tempo set in the game. Prep is not going to take that away.
---
wild is for old cards, but not we will keep gutting your old cards.  classic and basiic is so people Always got core set of cards in standard no matter but where making thhem all worthless slowly.
---
F for preparation BibleThump
---
That's a nice way to put it, the blunt way would be to say they want to sell more packs but the cards are "limiting" "design space=sales" like what zacho from VS said on twitter
---

---
theres not much to trim in the pirate package. all 5 pirates are needed and strong.  The raiding party nerf was harder than the prep nerf imo. Comboing a 4 mana spell is going to take up an entire turn, which could really hurt tempo. But the nerfs were indeed very much needed.
---
I feel the exact same way. It's not really that I'm mad at these changes, just more that I'm greatly disappointed that they thought what they did was fine. Prolly gonna take a break for a while.
---
9 times out of 10 you're going to use the coin by then, and only able to have 9 cards in hand can be kinda bad (8 if you draw her Elysiana early)
---
&gt; Jade Blossom is directly better than wild growth so I only ever play that
---
WG does have the card draw at 10 mana.
---
The only time you prep a sap/evis is to make a big Edwin early or kill a turn 3 giant while still developing your board those are not common thinks imo
---
Yeah, Blizzard showing a willingness to make balance changes quickly and multiple times during an expansion leaves me with some confidence that they'll wield the nerf hammer again if Mage, Hunter or any other class gets out of hand after these Rogue nerfs. Of course, Bloodlust and Fire Elemental still see play occasionally, there is always a chance they just end up nerfing a unobjectionable basic Shaman class card instead. RIP Flametounge Totem - you died for the sins of Wild Genn.
---
They should have gone full Warsong Commander on Prep.
---
I agree with you but I want to mention, that Control Warrior could tech against Mages and Hunters with BGH and Owls. Or simply play Mecha'thun instead of Elysiana to beat maybe Control Shaman.
---
It's simply a good deck, which benefits from Rogues, but can compete with the field thanks to his ability to survive and remove threats.
---
I tried the Gepetto Mecha'thun Warrior yesterday and won every game, it's such a fast deck compared to Elysiana Warrior. One time I even burned the Hero and still won against a Hunter.
---
Control Warrior will stay relevant imo.
---
Thanks dude
---
Sprint falls in line with all the other card draw. 1 mana for the first card and 2 for each additional.
---
I was more upset by equality nerf. Control paladin already struggling and they demolish their best removal option. Long live aggro says blizzard apparently.
---
Finally, someone who understands
---
108 IQ lethal at best
---
That is pretty much what they want. It's blizzards baby. They love that shit. One day though, it will reach peak bullshit and warrant a graveyard hate card or a nerf to some res spells.
---
baleful banker is a neutral.
---
Not technically infinite. But a 30 card deck + Elysiana + Banker gives you a 50 card deck. And after 50 turns the game ends in a draw, so that's essentially infinite if both players do this, resulting in 40+ minute games that don't even matter for anyone involved.
---
Og boom dodged nerfs his whole life in standard. Its thematic
---
Time to return standart. Everywhere gonna be full of bigff priest now in wild.
---
There's a huge post on the frontpage that you could use..no idea why your opinion would warrant an own post.
---
So, hunterstone.
---
I know what you are saying, I’m saying the number of people playing a class won’t bring a winrate above “what it should be”. If anything the more people playing a given class/deck the closer to average its winrate should get.
---
Yeah, I know it "technically" isn't over costed, but 7 mana sprint would never see play in a world without prep, especially considering rogue is not able to play control well.
---
It’s simple in this case, Brian’s opinion is better for pros and hardcore players who have massive collection and seeing regular shuffled to the game would understandably excite them. 
---
From a casual prospective or someone who’s worried about casuals leaving the game, a strong reliable evergreen set is simply better. You won’t have to make up a deck of 30 new cards every time a rotation happens.
---
Or no matter what the balance team does, some people are going to be unhappy. Hearthstone is a terrible game that happens to be played by millions and millions of people every day. There are going to be vocal minorities on just about every change made to the game, because everyone plays the game differently, and for different reasons. It's impossible to make a change that caters to them all, but maybe they can make some amount of changes that stem the bleeding from people who leave because of a LACK of change.
---
Innervate, Wild Growth, Keeper of the Grove, Savage Roar, Force of Nature and Ancient of Lore would like a word.
---
sTrOnG cLaSsIc SeTs 4 aLl
---
Soooo should I craft'em all in gold now?
---
I think printing Elysianna was a huge mistake for many reasons. It is the only card that *cleanses* your deck of any bombs, traps, bloods etc. Such a huge limit on design space.
---
I feel you
---
For competitive standard not much changes but not everyone plays competitive standard. Some people play wild. Some people play off-meta decks. Not everyone is a spike who is obsessed with tier lists. This is a big deal for a lot of people.
---
These nerfs were fairly mild. Rogue will be in a much better position than Druid is.
---
I'm with you dude, and I say this as a rogue player.  Dagger up is also the best hero power to affect early game board control. 
---
I'm almost confident that rogue will still find a place in this meta after these nerfs.
---
My ladder experience past month:
---

---

---
It's rising up in wild already. I know they have better stuff available, but standard has enough decent murlocs to make a strong aggro deck. I think now that tempo rogue has been rekt, it can rise up a bit more.
---
I would prefer ALL classic cards unnerfed, and put in wild.
---
I have zero preps.  I may finally be able to play a non- budget rogue deck.
---
You’re getting downvoted but I agree with you and the circlejerk is strong in these threads.
---
It’s about time prep is nerfed. And there’s been plenty of good rogue decks throughout HS that didn’t even play prep.
---
Ever heard of anecdotal evidence?
---
Besides aggro decks, VS ranks only exodia mage and mill rogue as favoured against big priest. Not a very diverse lineup. Both are also very bad against aggro, so the priest counters are keeping them away.
---
100% of the tier 1 decks are aggro, with maybe the exception of even shaman.
---
On top of all that, kingsbane was one of the best decks to keep priests in check. Guess who's getting heavily nerfed right now?
---
Going first is still favored in almost all decks, now and historically. While the coin is kinda weird how it behaves, nerfing going second is dumb.
---
less rogue = mrish decks rogue trounced get to thrive = mrish decks trounce warrior (see : mage in gm) = warrior gets knocked down
---
also elysiana can only be repeated as shaman now so warrior doesnt auto-win that matchup due to boom +elysiana power and now has to fight hagatha+elysiana x2
---
overall : not looking great for control warrior but im not 100% on bomb warrior - maybe rush-bomb becomes its go to?
---
Don't worry myra's is still broken and might just prop up another aggro deck without the pirate package.
---
Dalaran Heist Heroic is significantly more of a challenge than Normal, but not as hard as the past Heroic modes I remember. Treat Normal as the test bed for uncovering synergies / anti-synergies and creating broken decks for Heroic.
---
Wow really? Thought my game was bugged.
---
You could argue that 5 mana draw 3 is basically the vanilla standard for card draw so actually it isn't too ridiculous.
---
- no one ever
---
&gt;What about vanish? What about sprint? What about necrium vial? What about espionage? These are the cards Im thinking about  in regards of the prep nerf
---
You can still play all of these cards?
---
Conjurers calling is fine. It's only stupid because you can play a 3 Mana 8/8 first. It's the Giants that are the problem.
---
Dude the most important cards for Druid where nerved before that and they were fine the same will be with the Rogue cards
---
Thing is though, with Rogue out of the way, Mage can tech harder against warrior than Warrior can against mage. Astromancers, Jan'alai, Power of Creation, there is no shortage of tech for mages. 
---
In fact, I just took an anti-warrior [version of Cyclone mage to top 200](https://twitter.com/PvPretender/status/1130490554792501249) and most of the matches weren't even close.
---
That being said, I do agree that C warrior will remain relevant, but not nearly as prevalent as now.
---
Elysianna nerf was expected and very healthy even for us that play warrior in ladder, I kinda understand the changes but the prep nerf I think its a big blow to all rogues
---
You can't bounce her back anymore with Brewmaster in the same turn.
---
Only if you have and safe the coin, which would be a dumb strategy.
---
"Let's change a card from the Evergreen set that's broken because of new cards that will rotate" yeah ok
---
Token doesn't have big minion removal. Usually just by magnetizing your mechs into a big one, you usually win.
---
Zoo is certainly better against mech Hunter. I don't think most zoo packages run that much removal though. If you can get a big taunt and kill their carpets it's usually game over for them until they run out of steam. Also if you can get venomizer, missle launcher they usually can't do anything. 
---
Murloc I'm not sure about as I haven't played against a murloc shaman since I started playing mech Hunter.
---
They continue to attack the classic set. 
---
  
---
When will we see other heavily used classic class cards nerfed? Brawl? Swipe? Northshire Cleric? Shield Slam? Frost Bolt?
---
If prep is getting nerfed like this shield slam will be next.
---
Playing millhouse on t2 doesnt dodge those things, it just gives your opponent a chance to gain huge tempo early on if he had spell heavy hand and because you will be on 3 mana, the odds are he will steamroll over you even if you have the card advantage. That being said it is less  likely they have spell heavy hand because you usually mulligan for 2 drop minions so it kind of makes sense to play t2. Also because it is arena it can be a good tempo card in the late game when your opponent is in topdeck mode but that requires that you arent in topdeck mode to take advantage of its efficent mana cost. The odds in that situation are though that you would win the game anyways if thats the case so the bottom line is that it is never a strong card which makes it awful legendary.
---
Really depends on skill level/legend stats only, the rest of the ranks dont matter.
---
All of those cards have been nerfed and Rogue is still dominant. What's the issue? Clearly their class set is too strong.
---
warrior gets hit by the fact mage and hunter go up: those are two of its worst matchups. paladin also improves because its one of the classes bullied out by rogue and ALSO beats up on warrior.
---
in the control matchup: shaman can now out-fatigue and with 10 more cards maybe hagatha can outdo boom a lot more consistently. that one needs to be seen
---
another class that have been hard bullied by rogue is priest and I'm super curious to see what it does
---
Bruh KB rogue is T1 and arguably the best deck in the game
---
Fan is 3 mana draw one card and deal one damage. Compared to things like Arcane Intellect it's effectively a .5 mana cheaper arcane explosion bundled in.
---
I knew saving my golden prep for 4 years would pay off.
---
It is played in 50% of decks. That's outrageous.
---
The worst part is that rogue peaks hard at the beginning of the year. I have no idea how the class will compete come November when every other class has massive stall and board clears
---
No Conjurer's nerfs, great.
---
It also meant that as long as ramp was as good as it was, then they can never print powerful cards or else druid would get access to them faster than anyone else.
---
Which is a good thing. I'm trying out your deck for sure after the nerf.
---
Seems like its time for my murloc mage to shine.
---
Inferior swine, let this thought cross your mind:
---
#Prep &gt; Coin &gt; Backstab &gt; Concede
---
Not as long as mages are summoning 3 12 drops for 5 mana and 2 cards, or hunters can make as many 7/7's as they want. generic_midrange.dec hasn't worked for a while now and rogue was carried by the power of the turn 3 RP into turn 4 Waggle + double Corsair.
---
[[Arcane Intellect]] , 3 mana, draw 2.
---
[[Sprint]] , 7 mana, draw 4.
---
Not only is it something you can't play till later in the game, especially now with the Prep nerf, it's something that uses two cards to play unless you want to spend 7 mana on one card as a Rogue lul
---
No one will run it if it's 50% of one matchup. And if it started becoming meta, people would just run Bomb Warrior instead.
---
And who cares if people put a panda in the sideboard in tournaments? That's the point of Specialist. An objection to that is an objection to the format.
---
It works when you have no cards in deck
---
Freehealjobs #1408 need friend to watch game
---
Every single time I've faced this guy I just auto concede. This encounter is just SO infuriating... You just watch your feeble 0/X minions while he spams Obsidian Statue, Lich King and Ragnaros, and even if you manage to get through that he just brings them back with a thousand resurrect spells. Fuck you Haro.
---
Fair enough. I can see the arguments for not nerfing all the cards at once - I'm just saying that in Prep's case, I think it's justified for the long-term health of the game.
---
Theres no way miracle wont play post nerf prep when a literal coin was super strong in it.
---
Also this is like the 5th time "miracle has been killed"
---
I heard someone said it should just be a button you push one time that gives another mana for that turn

Counterfeit coin becomes real innervate! (RIP)
---
Yeah, it was especially stupid of them not to buff warrior cards to compensate for the Fiery War Axe nerf. Warrior never recovered.
---
Less tempo rogues means less warriors, less warriors means less weapon removal. Less weapon removal means we CAN PLAY TESSPIONAGE AGAIN. Yayayayayayayayay
---
Well there’s a thing called compromise. You don’t have to go fully one way or another
---
*cries in f2pbtw*
---
I mean at 9 cost the person with coin can put bounce it back so I feel like its a problem still
---
Lmao
---
It wouldn't be a Hearthstone balance update without nerfing the base set.
---
Arcane Explosion is 2 mana so Fan is basically getting draw for 1 mana, you could argue that fan is .5 over costed
---
Vanish doesn’t really have any comparisons other than psychic scream which cost 1 more. It’s hard to say how much better returning to hand is vs deck, but I think we could say it’s fair to say that if Priest was given Vanish for 6 mana it would be complained about being too strong.
---
Sprint is right on par for almost any draw card. AI 3 mana draw 2 , so playing 2 of them would be 6 mana draw 4, a fair 1 mana discount for playing 2 cards. A stronger example is Nourish is 6 mana draw 3, Rogue getting a 1 mana draw on top of that in comparison.
---
I just don’t see it.
---
This post aged very well
---
Psh, not-watching-the-stream ftl
---
Hunter didn't have a prep to cast it at 0 mana tho...
---
There's a reason for that. When rogue is tier 1, it's both insanely oppressive and extremely unfun and in interactive to play against. When other classes are tier 1, it's not always the same case.
---
Vior#21833 trading in EU, I show and you go first. thanks
---
Exactly, powerful card that is totally unplayable without synergy. Also a good card to have around to worsen RNG effects that generate random cards.
---
Minimal changes add up. Somewhere around 30 or so cards from Classic/Basic have been changed
---
imagine RPing in a card game
---
They butchered paladin, and now they're butchering rogue
---
Hunter meta coming back lol
---
Imagine casting a sprint for 3.5 mana 🤣
---
:( True enough .
---
I watched a good amount the first day, couldn’t catch much of the second.
---
don’t worry, assassinate will be 4 mana now
---
Well I said they have the freedom of doing stuff, not that they necessarily would do it immediately. I know Blizzard is shit at actually doing stuff even if they can, look at the lack of client features that they could have added since the beta ended.
---
I fully understand why they are doing it, but that preparation nerf makes me sad
---
Could be mistaken, but I believe he means druid back when it was nerfed super hard
---
Dragon Priest is *very* viable.
---
Zul'jin doesn't change your hero power providing infinite value like the other heros.    He's more like a really powerful spell, you can't counter.
---
Wtf do you mean? Rogue is essentially dead, with Prep + Raiding Party costing 2 mana instead of 0. These nerfs are almost as bad as the ones to druid.
---
I don't think Mountain Giant is the card to hit. It's like Leeroy except for hand decks. Without Mountain Giants there wouldn't be much reason to hold a large hand. Calling is definitely the problem card of that deck.
---
I’m gonna call Shaman being the big winner here.
---
Prep was too strong, sorry.
---
Like she will not be dead after that nerf control decks just have to be a little bit more careful with draw in the mirror matchup :)
---
Keep in mind, "long term health", i hate it too, but we'll probably be glad they did it here in another expansion or two.
---
I'd still say it's fair to nerf this for the long-term health of the game, though. How d'you know they didn't plan on printing some cool cards, but scrapped the idea in the womb? [[Master of Disguise]] obviously has never been broken, but they preemptively nerfed it, because it limited design space for future cards.
---
As for the idea of buffing (and your point on the Classic set), I don't disagree. I'm really not opposed to buffing some weak cards, and the Classic set's flaws have been discussed by many - I agree that a better system could be put in place. Hell, I'd argue most of it could use an overhaul. The same offenders keep coming back, time and time again. Mountain Giant, and all of that. In the meantime, though, cards like Prep really don't seem good to keep around in their original state, and I stand by my statement that the card's nerf is okay. Though, as I conceded to another person, I can see that nerfing it at the same time as other Rogue cards seems like a little much.
---
I just realized prep is now the old innervate for spells. RIP indeed.

It's still a very cheap tutor that they can use in different ways (like with Zul'jin).  When you take away a lot of decks holding Hunter back, you might want to touch Hunter.  Even VS suggested nerfing Scavenging Hyena (instead of Masters call) if you hit Rogue.
---
pissed at the Prep nerf, why cant we just wait out what the other nerfs do before touching one of the most important cards
---
Prep raiding party is a 2 card combo that draws 3 cards. How is that broken? It's also the only draw in most rogue decks unless you put that one rare fan of knives in. Almost no decks use shiv and miracle rogues with auctioneer are also very rare.
---
I don't think he was in favor of it because it just fills the game with useless cards when they could just rotate out the set
---
900+ wins on warlock. Have enjoyed control, zoo, and Genn variants at different times.  
---
I mostly like the health/hand balancing, and the fact that you draw so many cards help make the decks more consistent than most alternatives.
---
&gt;It’s simple in this case, Brian’s opinion is better for pros and hardcore players who have a massive collection and seeing regular shuffles to the game would understandably excite them.

Rogue has always been resilient to nerfs.  I predict there will just be a new meta.  When they nerfed Kingsbane (well, lifesteal), it barely fazed Rogue players.   They kept nerfing Auctioneer and it didn't matter.  Everyone thought a 6 mana 4/4 was unplayable.  And after all of these nerfs, Van Cleef is still the same?  Rogues will be fine.
---
If you were a returning player, wouldn't Zayle be an absolutely awesome reward?  Get a taste of the meta without investing any other dust.
---
Patience! Let the other decks brawl it out first, we've got a lot "year of the dragon" left
---
Rogue Nerf = Warrior Nerf
---
Warrior was the only class that kills Rogue. With Rogue gone, Hunter and Mage will destroy Warrior. It's not rocket science, it's literally explained in the official Blizzard blog post.
---
Control Shaman can play it twice essentially with Shudderwock
---
[[The Darkness]]
---
All of rogues spells are balanced around a 3 cost discount possibility. All of rogues spells are over-cost one now. ALL OF THEM. This is the worst change you could possibly make. Blizzard is trying hard to sell more cards by nerfing the ones you already have. It's ruining the game I might stop playing.
---
classic sets death by a thousand cuts :)
---
Prep has always been a problem card, look at how they've had to design cards with costs based around it. It had to be nerfed sooner or later, and it looks like they've decided to just take the pain now and open up design space in the future.

---
Haha this won't effect me. I'll just play 2 preps before my spells now.
---
Prep is/was one of the strongest cards in the game.,.
---
That seems like a terrible idea that leads to seeing the same decks, strategies and cards ad infinitum.  I'm with Kibler on this one.

Yea that one sucks. Some of the bosses seem blatantly overturned and force you to pick Mana cheat strats
---
&gt;all demon buff cards for field say they "-to a **minion**, if it's a demon."
---
Mal'Ganis doesn't, off the top of my head.
---
And if the core set is too weak The moment a class fails to receive something as good as other classes in an expansion, which will roughly be 100% of the time, the class instantly falls into obscurity until they get something new and better
---
They nerfed Elysiana but not Boom LUL? Excuse me what the fuck
---
Yeah meme decks that still rely on prep for control and card draw the problem is prep was a design limiting card that were limiting good rogue spells at "fair" cost with prep everything felt smoother... I dont play tempo rouge and i also think that the other nerfed cards were the problem and definitely not prep yeah its powerful but only with good spells like for example raiding party which is nearly a sprint for 3 mana... With targeted draw... like wtf? And this into a 4 Attack rogue weapon... Idk what they thought about this
---
*shivers*
---
But let’s not nerf omega devastator 4 mana 4/5 kill almost anything.
---
shoulda specified jaraxxus hero. As in interactions with jaraxxus when hes already been played. Your interaction still works
---
Although you seem to be on my side, callbacks aren't reprints.
---
I remember the shaman boss on heroic who killed me with double crackle on turn 5
---
Lucky dog didn’t roll less than a 5 in 6 attempts but what surprises me the most is he realized his best play was a bs attempt for lethal
---
Same Brian Kibler that said Standard in HS wouldn't work because of the lack of cards? Because removing classic totally fixes that...
---
Looks like not even all the Brian Kiblers agree with each other /s
---
(They would have to release more sets to increase the standard cardpool if they removed classic, which would increase the costs and make more people flee.)
---
So what. The match-up against warrior is great, it can easily stand to get a little worse.
---
That thing kinda died when they said there wouldn't be a lot of nerfs after the game entered in open beta and changed their minds a couple of years after release.
---
The Darkness
---
That prep nerf makes me feel sick. I get what they’re saying about sap and eviscerate they’re right those interactions won’t change. But what about sprint and literally every single other rogue spell...
---
That's because it's not a nerf to make warrior weaker, but a nerf to make warrior mirrors more standable. Rogue's strength was a large reason why warrior was so strong, and with hunter/murloc shaman/mage on the rise after rogue's nerf warrior will inevitably get weaker. It also gives people an incentive to play control shaman, which is nice.
---
Yeah I'm glad I held onto my golden Preparation for almost a year. I knew eventually it was gonna be nerfed.
---
A standard with more cards is less predictable/doesn't get solved in a weekend-ish, which means more room for deck teching, countering the anti-meta decks that pop up after week 2, etc.
---
So what you're saying is that Rogue isn't actually all that dominant in the current meta. Looking at then tier ranking and see how healthy a mix of classes there are in the top two tiers right now. Only Paladin and Priest aren't too hot right now. This is one of the best metas we've had in a while.
---
He is right tho
---
Honestly, the sac pac interaction is fucking stupid too
---
