Probably, but the secret interaction quotes make it worth it.
---
---
---
I mean, hitting Sylvanas with it is great, but Mage already has even more degenerate stuff tbh.  Most of the time I‚Äôd take 2 giants over 2 random 6 drops (iirc the average statting of those is something like 4-5?) and a random enemy minion.
---
lol I actually have noob, made it with my murloc Shaman whipping mage last expansion
---
Poggossss
---
I would recommend swapping a prep for a gadgetzan auctioneer so you can occasionally highroll and show the enemy just how much better prepared you are than them. Could also maybe throw in a copy of Illidan so you can play him at the end to really rub it in.
---
You can check to see which cards are in the Hall of Fame set by going into your collection by filtering under "Hall of Fame"
---
The more common one is quest Mage, which might actually have a better MU there because it can go through Iceblock while exodia can fall to reno+any removal that clears out the specs.
---
Haha, didn't see it that way before.

YOU ALL MAKE FUCKING EXCELLENT POINTS AND I FUCKING AGREE WITH ALL OF YOU

I do this but haven't played hearthstone in like 3 years lmao
---
You win SoM, you lose SoM.
---
I disagree, the card is so strong it was for the best to be near unplayable outside of very niche combo decks. Turn 4 Lunas can beat anything including what should be the decks worst matchups (aggro and tempo) before the buff conjures Mage was strong but not this broken thing. If
---
The turn 4 board isn‚Äôt really a thing in the normal version of the deck, it‚Äôs turn 5.  
---
It‚Äôs also a MASSIVE highroll to get it that early; you can‚Äôt talk about a decks power in only the best case, consistency matters.
---
GOLDEN ARMOUR
---
Hmm I doubt we'd see many 'double quest' decks other than for the memes.
---
Then the mage plays galaxy anyways and still wins lol
---
Considering the top deck in standard is still control warrior there's a healthy representation of slow decks
---
My point is that Zeph doesn‚Äôt say it pulls from the basic and classic set only. It doesn‚Äôt say it in the card text or the flavor text or anywhere in the game. To learn that, you have to go to hearthpwn or reddit or some other secondhand source.
---
Hello yes I am here to register a complaint. I did everything you said as far as I can tell but was offered Gorehowl, Ysera, and Loot Hoarder.

---
There are a variety of much better ways they can improve the Hearthstone economy without focusing on the players who want to play to Legend every month.
---
If you don't want to play to Legend every month and you see it as "work" and "a grind," then guess what? The fact it's only 45 dust you're "losing out on" is an utterly fantastic thing. Besides that Legend cardback that you only need to hit Legend *once* to unlock, you have no real incentive to make that grind every season. That's awesome.
---
So if you enjoy playing the game or you just want *that badly* to be good at it, Legend is there for you.
---
If you're doing it for juicy rewards, then no thank you. The playerbase would be far better off with rewards systems catering to more than just the top level players.
---
Even just increasing rewards from Rank 25 to Legend is a far better option than only increasing it from Rank 5 to Legend.
---
Even so, I refer back to [a comment I made a small while ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/cqaaum/whats_your_way_to_fix_the_economy/ewuvled/?context=3) All three things I suggested would be far better for the playerbase as a whole in dealing with Hearthstone economy than just throwing a few more breadcrumbs at a few select players.
---
I also refer to Jeff Kaplan's point about regretting making Golden Weapons "more exclusive" to higher level players (such as Competitive Point rewards at the end of each season that scales up with rank), because people who play Ranked should do it to improve or play in a competitive environment, *not* for shiny shiny.
---
And seriously mate, if it's a "grind" then just don't do it.
---
Thank god they took her out so that Carnivorous Cube could be balanced.
---
Mogu cultist and draw... I love to see that 20/20
---
It‚Äôs a basic card...
---
You‚Äôll have a valid opinion when you design art for 1000+ cards, and animate them all just for the pretty golden animation that the majority of players will never see.
---
In that case, just increase your apm.

Can I say I'm still in awe thinking about the way zephyrs works. Like the code written for him is way better a player then I am...
---
People have made it to legend with pretty budget decks, but usually they require at least something crafted.
---
(I believe someone made it to legend with an Even Paladin deck that had Genn and 29 basic cards).
---
I'm trying to think if there's any class that you could climb with with using 30 basic cards, and IDK, that sounds pretty rough.  Maybe some kind of hunter?  You get Arcane Shot, Kill Command, Hound Master, Animal Companion, Tundra Rhino, Tracking.  That's a decent start.  But like...no secrets, no weapons, no unleash the hounds, no Savannah Highmane.  You would be packing like...Bloodfen Raptor, River Crocolisk, and Oasis Snapjaw for sure.  You still need about 6 more basic cards to fill that out.  Wolfrider, Reckless Rocketeer, Timber Wolf, Multi Shot, and...idk, maybe Bluegill Warrior and Chillwind Yeti?

There's really not much new here. It's been pretty much unanimous among pro players that LPG and Dr Boom are too strong and deserve to be nerfed.
---
The comments regarding the Druid Quest were pretty interesting, it has a pretty poor winrate against most of the tier 1-3 decks, but they're talking about it like Mage and Warrior are the only things holding it back. I disagree, but it's obviously some very good players who are saying that.

Ah so NOT current mage cards?...

I like your government secrets. I think I will TAKE it!

Trackobot!

---
Thank you. I can't unsee it now
---
Apologies. Will do.
---
It makes sense. Zephrys does not really know what card do you play before, it only looks at the board state. The presence of Auchenai Phantasm on the board does not guarantee that you play it and have the battlecry effect applied. You can get it from evolve, recruit, resurrect, etc. So for ease of development, I think it's much easier and reliable to just ignore battlecry minions, as opposed to offer the wrong a card.  
---
(That being said I'm not sure if they did make a special condition for Soulpriest though, this might still be a coincidence)
---
I almost like watching Kibler more than playing. I get so triggered playing control warrior and Battlecry Shaman 20 times in a row.
---
Maybe he only got minions from Espionage
---

Wait wait wait, Venture Co. Mercenary is a goblin? I always thought he was some owl creature.

---

---
Sure. Feel free to ask me anything!
---
Because he is not yours he is you.
---
I like the flavor of it not having taunt, unlike every other thing like it.  It‚Äôs a BLATANT decoy, so it doesn‚Äôt distract anyone into attacking it.
---
Did you play during karazahn? Have you played recently? Are we talking about hearthstone?
---
I wouldn't be surprised if someone told me that the way Auchenai Soulpriest was programmed in was that it changes the rule of *things that heal do in fact heal* to *things that heal now deal damage*, similar how Crystal Core changes a rule in the programming which is why it can't be silenced (I vaguely remember this, so I can't find the quote) . 
---
So when Zephrys looks for a card, it's most likely taking in the rules of the current game state and "always finding lethal if available", so it doesn't "*know*" Auchenai, it's inspecting the "*rules*". I dunno, my two cents.
---
Anyone have a decklist for Quest Paladin? I've seen some brutal mech Paladins running the new quest and I would love to give it a go!
---
But at the same time sometimes you waste multiple turns before it pays off and you‚Äôre just dead to the original tempo swing.
---
There‚Äôs an argument to be made about the volatility of the card, but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs totally broken.
---
Totally agree with you, Barnes is not the Problem. 4 mana discover a minion to resurrect and the whole broken res pool mechanic are the problems.
---

---
There is soooo much they could do to make a grind. Make a class card back,Animation Entrance, title, alternate hero art. They could even introduce class packs that are rewarded for tiers of wins, or add a could levels every expansion that unlocks select cards from each expansion to get a taste of each and an extra little reason to come back each season. They could even do a custom little class adventure with custom dungeon run bosses that unlock at tiered wins to actually earn the rewards to make it that much more special, like Arthas.
---
1. Sounds great! I‚Äôll look to add it when I get the chance
---
2. If I get enough feedback/requests from other people, I will look to making one of those. The problem with it is that I already have this guide and two dusting charts to update periodically, and adding something on top of that which compares decklists that change and shift throughout the year will add a whole other layer of complexity and time requirement to update it. But notes have been taken, thanks for the feedback.
---
3. If that‚Äôs the case, then I‚Äôll take your word for it. I was hesitant to add Combo Priest in the first place but some people brought it up in a server I‚Äôm in so I based the overview off a recent high legend decklist that chose to not run the Dragon package. A question about this though: is Amet still played in the Dragon package list? Also since you‚Äôre more knowledgeable than I am in Combo Priest, what does the current list look like for you? I may base it off yours for the update.
---
That's not true, I've had home offer Lava Burst and Fieball in the same go, or Savage Roar and Bloodlust when either one would do enough damage
---
2 mana frost nova...hooo man
---
More like rank 49, maybe.
---
What about that old cannon card that would do 2 damage per summoned pirate?
---
yeah, but the listed cards never had "enrage" stated no their card. They were not changed after enrage was removed or replaced. You could keep Spellzerker and Quartz Elemental the way they are right now and only replace "has +X damage while damaged" with enrage. It would also fit with the meaning of enrage. 
---
But ofc I also get that Zephrys is not able to read the card text of all cards and consider them, but I think if he would at least be able to identify some legendaries it would be good. (for example Garrosh giving you Inner Rage and when Antonidas is on board a cheap spell like Magic Trick and when your enemy has Amet on board you should get Shadow Word Pain)
---
man, if only there were some sort of way to group minion text into some sort of easily indexable keyword to help provide information without hard programming each card into his algorithm
---
*Maybe something like "Enrage" /s*
---
Thanks the help, and btw. I'm from Finland.
---
He looks so stoned tho
---
Zephrys ALWAYS offers Pyro if the enemy is at 10 effective health or less and there's no way for lethal this turn.
---
I say effective because when offering you a Pyro for next turn Zephrys will always assume a Warrior and a Priest is at +2 health and that a Druid is at +1 health.
---
In this scenario the Warrior is on 11 effective health so it wouldn't offer Pyro.
---
I knew it someone would  comment that.
---
I don't believe it's possible
---
Reno always heals for 30 (Or 40 if Amara was played beforehand) just hearthstone doesn't show the overheal

Quest wall priest:
---
"Am I a joke to you?"
---
I think problem isn‚Äôt that they are interesting and powerful, it‚Äôs that we have had decks that use them for several years now. 
---
People want new toys and strategies. The old stuff is, well, old.
---
Going off of stats from HSreplay, Pocket Galaxy is one of the highest winrate cards to have in your opening hand. Simply having it in your hand leads to a 70% winrate, which is more than t1 Northshire from Combo Priest, t7 Dr Boom from Warrior, t4 Prismatic from Pally, etc.
---
The average turn it is played on is around low to mid t6, at least in the highest winrate and play rate decks including it. Going off of those stats (for what they're worth), it is both consistent AND game winning.
---
Maybe the goal to make wild more appealing.
---
here I come
---
Just the animation..
---
The opponent conceded immediately.. so I'm only 99% sure tho..
---
More dust for me
---
No, what is it and how does it relate to this topic?
---
I just don't see how Malygos restricts design space. It's a 9 mana card that takes a lot of support to work and the potential support cards they can design represent a huge design space.
---
What does it prevent them from printing, 0-1 mana damage spells that can hit face? Curve cheating cards, which are pretty much all risky designs by definition? The resurrect mechanics everyone loves?
---
You and your hero are synonymous typically in this game
---
HoF Divine Spirit and Mountain Giant, nerf Dr Boom and Mage. I honestly don't think they'll nerf LPG, in the best case it will be bumped to 6 mana, but if Crystology didn't get nerfed, Galaxy won't be either. I do believe they will nerf CC, making it 4 or 5 mana.
---
2.5gb app, but maybe 1mb of text is asking too much
---
Of course they have been, hence "sees any play" and "usually". Just because they pop up in the meta every once in a while (again, God forbid any classic card sees any play) doesn't mean they need to be HoFed.
---
Shuffles hand into deck and redraws cards. There's a whole deck built around it
---
Hex, in case you thought blizzard had forgotten.
---
Unironically, I think we should. I think we should have a massive shakeup to the core set. 
---
The core set being static for this many years makes the game feel stale. Feels like the same decks we‚Äôve seen forever, but with a slightly different twist depending on the expansion. 
---
Give players some replacement cards and/or lots of dust as compensation for rotating cards.
---
I don't mind the Lion King on turn 6 TBH
---
Highmane aint that good these days lol
---
I mean, jokes aside, as far as 6 drops go the winrate on Armagedillo is way higher than Highmane (relative to their decks).
---
Armagedillo is the second highest drawn winrate of any card in control warrior.  Behind Dr Boom, but slightly ahead of Zilliax, Eternium Rover, Frightened Flunky, Sn1p Sn4p, Brawl.
---
Highmane is one of the lowest drawn winrates in highlander hunter (and is sometimes being cut from highlander hunter).  Highmane also gets run in midrange beast hunter where it's also...kinda meh (one of the lower drawn winrates in the deck).
---
(Granted, the best 6 drop is none of the above; it's Reno the Relicologist, but that has deckbuilding restrictions).
---
Brawl to 6 would still allow brawl + omega devastator for a board clear
---
Zephyrs will always offer lethal...if he sees it. He is basically a rank 25 scrub.
---

Yea rotating sets or cards like that will be much more sensible and can provide a more diverse experience, considering we can once again play old wild cards in a totally different meta altogether.
---
Firebat was saying in a podcast that he plays control warrior when waiting in line at the grocery store, because of how little decision making there is in the deck

---
Hopefully they but warrior: I've been playing it a lot purely to increase how prevalent it is, and it stupidly powerful.
---
It's also boring as hell.
---
except quest mage,who win 90% of the time i would say
---
30 Earth Shocks ;)
---
You are agreeing with him.
---
Wow! This line is so genius, you have to be the new davinci for sure to figure that out.
---
30 Fire Bolt just for historical reasons.
---
The two biggest offenders are probably **Luna's Pocket Galaxy** and **Dr. Boom**.  I think *most* players expect these to be touched though you could attack the value of Control Warrior (**Omega Assembly/Omega Devastator**) or Mage (**Conjurer's Calling/Mountain Giant**) as well.
---
Priest will need to get touched as well as it is one of the best decks in the meta while the other top decks are likely getting nerfs.  I think you attack High Priest Amet and make it more mana or less health.  At 5-6 health it would be very killable when played and less snowbally.
---
There are lots of guides out there for completing solo adventures using budget decks. There was a guy in here that specialised in don't just that. I think he even did some with just classic and basic cards.
---
I am sure if you Google the adventure name and budget decks you will find what you are looking for.
---
If you need more specific help then let us know the adventure (s) you are having trouble with.
---
It's a strong card but it's a big part of Warrior's identity. Control Warrior hasn't historically been a powerful until Baku and Dr Boom turned things up a notch.
---
Yeah sure let‚Äôs just nerf the classic set further. Because fuck poor people am I right?
---
Well blizzard is a small indie company
---
Is there a game with the appeal of Hearthstone that is much slower-paced?
---
#####My Predictions
---
Priest will need to get touched as well as it is one of the best decks in the meta while the other top decks are likely getting nerfs.  **Divine Spirit** and **Inner Fire** should have been HoF'd already but Priest has so many Basic/Classic set problems, it can't exist without them.  I think you attack **High Priest Amet** and make it more mana or less health.  At 5-6 health it would be very killable when played and less snowbally.
---
Well that‚Äôs like saying Gadgetsan Auctioneer was fine at 5 Mana because he didn‚Äôt killed you... 
---
If you say just play minions into the Cleric, Priests will either buff her with arms maintain the board while drawing or play some injured guys and draw again a shitload of cards. 
---
Yes Cleric usually doesn‚Äôt kill you ( that‚Äôs why I wrote ...almost...) , but she cycles like crazy , wich enables Priest to kill you very fast.
---
Yes Rogue. 15x Prep 15x Myra's Unstable Element
---
Alright, this is a handful. Let's break it down:
---
Mountain Giant only works on turn 4 if you do nothing for the first 3 turns, which made it weak against Aggro decks - I mean what good is an 8/8 to you when I can just stab you in the face? The only time MG is a problem is either when Aggro is weak (current Standard meta for instance), or when you can somehow solve MG's earlygame (Genn), or when it actually gives you access to defensive options (CC).
---
The best way to take care of Mountain Giant is actually by BUFFING Grave Horror to 11 mana, which means CC can't hide you behind a wall of taunts anymore.
---
DS getting HoF'd only works if Priest has other win conditions, which, at the moment, it does not. Resurrecting waves upon waves of minions isn't particularly exciting for either player, and since Mind Blast's HoF, Priest can't really do much. IF, and only IF Blizzard added not one, but MULTIPLE new win conditions for Priest, then losing DS wouldn't be as painful as it would be now.
---
I mean quest mage is more the exception not the general rule
---
Dr. Boom loses the armor up for 7.
---
Either Omega Devastator or Tomb Warden loses the mech tag. I'd much prefer the former.
---
Mountain Giant is HoFed.
---
Luna's Pocket Galaxy back to 7 mana (although no dust refunds because).
---
Hex up to 5 mana.
---
Nozdormu down to 7 mana.
---
It's a joke about how playing Jaraxxus will almost always result in a loss.
---
Yeah I‚Äôd have a 70% win rate at ranked too bruv
---
Over 25 whole games
---
Seems like it'd complicate things a lot what happens to recruited minions and stuff
---
I think a restriction would hurt the card more than it would benefit it. And making Jaraxxus 8 mana just isnt a feasible solution. His hero power is just to strong to be played on the same turn. On the other hand raising him to 10 mana and maybe adding my 20 health set would be a little more balanced. But thanks for the input.
---
A long time ago I tried wild with both Jaraxxus and the DK and realized how much that health caps sucks. It didn't matter how much I healed with Bloodreaver's hero power, it never felt like it was worth it.
---
Nope, also much weaker. All mechs played until then had no rush, harder to set up a favorable board state to play it, and misses out on all the value on the way there.
---
If you want to argue that Boom *still* gives mechs rush and *still* changes the hero power, sure, that's true, but a late LPG *still* changes minions in the deck to 1 mana.
---
I think yes, Their balance changes between expansions often target future expansions instead of the current meta. So they sometimes seem random like the hex one but makes sense later. It s kind of sad  that Priest keeps getting gutted so other classes can have their fun. Priest have become Blizzard's trashcan. Sometimes it seems that they design Priest cards to be played in Rogue for 1 mana or to be conjured in Mage decks. Really sad thing, and this reddit hate bonner for Priests doesn't help either.
---
Doesn't make sense take mind blast away from Priest when it was the worst class (popularity and wr) in the previous expansion having in mind that there is not a single card from the Saviors of Uldum that would have made of mind blast a possible serious threat, not one card but zephrys. 
---
1 point of damage might not be a great difference having in mind that eviscerate exist, but at that point where you seek lethal every point matters, and mind blast would've been a often choice.
---
Yeah, it should obviously be boulderfist ogre. Do you think Shieldmasta or Yeti should go into the 4 mana slot though?
---
C'Thun is happy!üòÅ

I still remember the so called Highmane-rule. Not sure who made it up but it went something like *if your Highmane goes face once, you win*.

If they don't nerf dr boom I'm done with this game. All they need to do is make "your mechs have rush this turn" one of the hero power options to decrease occurance of 7 armor and delivery drone
---
How often are you off lethal by exactly 1 damage and mana from what Zephrys can offer, though? HoFing Mind Blast because the one point of damage would tip Zephrys from "strong" to "OP" makes even less sense.
---
Touche
---
Agreed or not, they only refund balance changes. This doesn't affect game balance in any way.
---
I just hit legend with highlander aggro warrior, there are other aggro decks such as zoo. In my opinion the problem is not the lack of aggro decks, mage and warrior have too many tools to stop them.
---
There isn't a neccessity to push aggro decks, we've had them ruling the meta year after year but it is true that the control strategies are out of control right now and should get a nerf.
---
Can you really complain if you're playing Combo Priest?
---
Do you have animations and sounds enabled? maybe it is trying to download those
---
Ah sorry. I forgot this thread was about you. Sorry.
---
I don't think they should nerf Galaxy directly, but instead the way Mana cost is handled. If a card is reduced to 1 Mana and played, it should stay 1 Mana for every future interaction on board.
---
Unfortunately not all the time. the gold that you save over an expansion guarantees the commons, but not all the rares. so I cannot say for sure all meta decks.  Usually I see my collection and see which deck I lack the least then craft one or a few of the remaining cards.
---
Hey I would understand asking for dust refunds for tri-class cards. Those were changed. Tess did not get changed at all tho, so why should they give dust refund for her? That's like giving dust refund for shudderwock every time a battlecry-minion gets nerfed.
---
Yeah, I wasn't affected by the bug. It's unfair for those that were and I wish they get compensated.
---
You could combo it with Vargoth for 10 damage, you cannot do that with evicerate nor lava burst.
---
You didn‚Äôt get a daily quest and you opened a support ticket, wtf, get a life.
---
That question should have been asked to Blizzard
---
Turn 8 Octosari
---
Testing this with the Dr would be a great way to test this interaction!  Good call.
---
I do every day my quests while rerolling for the 60g ones. But i play for over 3/4 years. So for a new player this Will probably will be way more difficult to do it.
---
Lolno
---
Oger
---
dunno bruh my brain just told me to did anduin so u know :DD
---
nerf: turn 5, turn 6, turn 7, turn 8
---
Also, I think some people had this go on for 2+ days.
---
So you would rather nerf More arms or Divine Spirit? 
---
Because they are certainly strong cards , wich i mentioned and don‚Äôt really mind if Priest gets powerful cards. What I do mind ( and several other Pros aswell) tho , is a 1 mana 1/3 with such a powerful effect. It‚Äôs simply unineractive since not every class can deal with this. 
---
And would guess Blizzards philosophy goes into the same direction.
---
Summon another Blood of the Ancient One

Zythum#1401 NA Spectating quest
---
For me it has been more like, I'll give you a false sense of hope that you might actually win this match and then 1 turn before you have lethal I will magically appear in your opponents hand.
---
That looks really good!
---
I'm not so sure, i mean, the massive amount of freeze can be enough to stop a giant mage deck, and tbh i didnt saw many cyclone mage
---
Quest rogue (3 times?), leeching poison, Evil Miscreant and raiding party. Those are expansion cards, though.
---
Zephrys only considers card text in very specific situations (doomsayer, basically). Zephrys would only give you mind blast if it is lethal regardless of Vargoth.
---
Also, mind blast did allow some turn 7 OTKs during RR. But the reason they rotated it was because of "class identity". Whether or not you buy this explanation is one thing, but stating mind blast rotated because Zephrys would be oppressive with mind blast and ok with everything else is just plain delusional
---
Dependents on what is relevant to you. If you mean competitive while ignoring all the subpar cards then it is close. When you are lucky with legend drops, yes. If you have to craft everything, unlikely. But you will be able to make about 3 or 4 Top tier decks per expansion
---
Big spell mage was running multiple copies of cards that leave behind huge bodies. Common play-patern was drop and early 8/8 giant and duplicate him into more 8/8 or 7/8's with taunt using conjurers calling.
---
Another typical heavy play of that deck was using the 8 mana spell to create two 6 drops.
---
All of that was powered up by Khadgar doubling down on your summoned big boys.
---
Rest of the deck were big spells that help control the board or make more big bodies.
---
Highlander is the current meta deck for mage. Its using only singleton's to make use of the new Zephrys card, Reno. Flexible deck capable of big plays but doesnt rely solely on having a giant+conjurer combo, but very well capable of value plays.
---
Fricking amazing
---
WTF? That's... I'm speechless...
---
ITT people who incorrectly blame Mountain Giant  as the problem. I suggest you [watch this video. Regis does a great job of breaking down the pure data ](https://youtu.be/7H5nm1VrwZw) that shows MG is not the culprit.
---
Can you remember if the mechs had deathrattles that would have left minions on board after a Nether? That's the usual reason for it not being offered.
---
Cyclone Quest Mage has nothing to do with this discussion. What are you even talking about?
---
Holy shit is this for real? That is one of the most insulting CS replies I have ever seen and reflects perfectly how the devs treats the HS customerbase.
---
Zephrys does not take card text in consideration, except for Doomsayer.
---
That Rastakhan nerf was probably the most severe nerf ever. They instakilled Druid, killed Kingsbane Rogue (which was almost Tier 0 iirc), killed Shudderwock OTK Shaman (which wasn't so OP but it was nerfed since it was a broken interaction) and they nerfed the most important card in Odd Paladin but the deck still survived
---
Excuse me, I think you will find that he is a little ball of *scales*. Not that it makes him any less good or petable.
---
^(At least I think it's scales. Could be, like, whatever kinda skin fish have. Is that also scales? LOOK POINT IS, NOT FUR)
---
And then I summon... the Zancient One
---
This the only time you are legally allowed to upvote unexpected unexpected results
---
&gt;Soon it will be the Taverns Below. Only good for heavy drinking Hearthstone.
---
I'm still triggered about the mana wrym nerf... spent tons of dust creating a deck that I played for 2 months. And did I get compensation for all that dust? Nah... here's 80 dust
---
Both of the summoned minions would be ‚Äúbone wraith‚Äù and not the exact bone wraith that died. Therefore both will be full 2/5s with reborn.
---
Ya kinda what i miss from vanilla HS, or the early era.
---
Yeah, fuck blizzard for nerfing the card for a 3rd time, and they actually found a leeway to not give compensation this time. The first two nerfs were alright and on point, but just who came up with the idea for nerfing it for a 3rd fucking time? It was totally unneeded and made the card absolutely unplayable, and it wasn't good already. Boom and Galaxy are terrorizing the standard meta, you know what, let's nerf an already bad card to oblivion. Sounds about right.
---
Wow that doesn't make sense... if ALL players got impacted by this, then why couldn't we get all be compensated ?
---
Barnes isnt' the problem of any deck, it's the never ending boardclears and big minions that makes the deck so strong and such a pain in the ass to play against, whatever deck you are playing.
---
I've tried playing against it with fast decks like odd rogue and I still lose against them, with or without Barnes.
---
&gt;  But the reason they rotated it was because of "class identity". 
---
I don't want to sound rude but I think ClAsS iDeNtItY is just pr bs. My main point is that Blizzard have a negative bias towards Priest and they are pretty confortable with the class being in the dumpster meta after meta.
---
son, there MUST be some hunter card targeted too. otherwise all this flock's hate present around nerfs woulnt be pleased ;D
---
&gt; Are you talking about the Cyclone/Giants quest mage, or the Antonidas one? Because if it‚Äôs the latter, then that deck is just worse than the one that uses Thaurissan to pull off the Exodia combo.
---
ur the one talking about this, and for me the Antonidas ur talkign is the classic Exodia, who get buffed by Pocket Galaxy
---
If you mean getting every meta deck, then no. That‚Äôs not a realistic possibility for a F2P player. Honestly, though, even if they had every card in the game, the average player likely doesn‚Äôt spend enough time with the game to get value out of having access to every single meta deck.
---
You *can* build multiple meta decks every expansion for free though which is plenty.
---
I played him last night as a hail mary and no mary's were hailed.
---
You think that's a big zinger when I'm just here like, yeah that's already the plan.  I'm hoping to release HS compatibility mid September.
---
What's the point of that sub? That sub is this sub.
---
Guys c'mon, *outrageous*? Really?
---
Like yeah, be cool if they gave you a free pack but Jesus how can you be *outraged* by this?
---
&gt;How dare this person politely refuse to not compensate me for my daily quest which is barely equivalent to 50 cents. Outrageous! Blood for the Blood God! Yarrrrr!
---
What about 4 mana 7/7?
---
Prismatic Lens?
---
I think people are just tired of seeing midrange ‚Äúcurvestone‚Äù hunter after it has existed with minimal changes since almost the beta
---
&gt; As rogue you're supposed to win before big boards even happen. 
---
I actually hate that. Every other class has the ability to play aggressively and controlly but not rogue because they never allow decent control tools. Vanish was unique in that it interacted as a board clear that bounced minions back to the opponents hand. No one board clear exists like that and I feel like the fact that it didn't actually remove minions from play entirely was what made it fair to have in rogue. And if you wanna minion the fact that if you had a full hand, minions would be killed, they could have just changed it so that those that would be killed get shuffled into your deck instead or something. I'd rather have that interaction than whole removal of the card from standard.
---
Nice

The longer the game goes, the better the chance control warrior has.

---
Hope they wont nerf mountaingiants. My pocket deck is handbuff darkest hour warlock in standrart. And the deck wont work without them.
---
Except Azure Drake was in Classic and Zilliax is already more than halfway toward Wild anyway.
---
You literally just made my night.
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Against aggro... and usually only aggro. What happens when its turn 13 and literally any midrange deck removes armagedillo and drops their own answers for the 6th time, with more resource generation in hand?
---
Ahhh, the "I'm you"-priest. One of my favorite fundecks.
---
Yeah, I'd like to see the full message too.
---
But yes, agreed. I‚Äôve just been watching twitch and YouTube videos of hearthstone. I‚Äôve missed like 3 days of new quests which I‚Äôve never done in the first few weeks of a new expansion... also I kept rerolling 50g quests into 50g quests, and that was demoralizing as well ha
---
&gt;Jaraxxus + Sac Pact interaction removed.
---
Can they please just retroactively make this card a Hero card? It's such a weird inconsistency that Jaraxxus is technically a Minion but otherwise behaves as a Hero card in 95% of cases. It only ever matters for Sense Demons, Bane of Doom, cards like Dirty Rat, and evolve effects (and the stupid Sac Pact interaction).
---
If Pocket Galaxy was 5 mana from start I highly doubt  people will  ask nerf it to only 6. It still will be good at 6(especially  if Conjurers calling not will be nerfed) with all this freezes around and people play Pocket galaxy even from 8 mana Tortollan, the only thing that mage  lack is healing tho. Probably  mana cost creatures after Pocket galaxy should be nerfed from 1 mana or Pocket galaxy should be totally  reworked somehow.
---
And... no you don't know IT, at least not software development, except possibly at a theoretical level. 
---
This is data, not a code change.
---
Then the control warrior uses it's 2nd generated Omega devastator to remove two minions.
---
I mean... we still dealt with Cutlass.
---
Also the games back then weren‚Äôt so predetermined: half of the decks have such polarizing matchups that you‚Äôre better conceding than wasting your time
---
Speechless that they politely refused to compensate you for something that isn't even equivalent to half a dollar?
---
All Relevant cards for all heroes? Maybe.
---
Let me give you an example of my collection:
---
I do my dailies and play very little (sometimes a few hours a day, sometimes I just roll a quest and don't play that day if for example I sit with 1 or 2 50g quests). So I open around 80 packs every expansion. I usually get 5-6 legendaries and craft one or 2 depending on if the decks interest me. I haven't had the urge/will to grind ladder since KoTF (There I reached rank 3 once) I try to reach 15 at least and sometimes reach rank 10.
---
Now, looking at the expansions currently in Standard:
---
Classic: I only really need Murloc Warleaders and maybe Far Sight.
---
Witchwood: I have 10 legendaries, and 27 epics. Important cards I'm missing and might still craft are: Houndmaster Shaw, Hagatha, Lord Godfrey, Azalina Soulthief. From those legendaries I might actually only craft Lord Godfrey for a few Wild decks. (Maybe Hagatha...) and missing epics: Rat Trap and one Town Crier (Town Crier I'll most likely craft if Warrior survives the nerfs.) 
---
Boomsday: I have 8 legendaries, and 20 epics. Important cards I'm missing and might still craft are: Stargazer Luna, Luna's Pocket Galaxy, Kangor's Endless Army, Dr Boom. Dr Boom is a definite craft if he doesn't get nerfed.  The rest I won't bother, I also need a lot of cards to make Mage work so LPG is not high on my priority. Missing epics: Astromancer, Prismatic Lens, Thunderhead and Supercollider. Prismatic Lens and Thunderhead I'll maybe craft. (Maybe one Supercollider, depending on nerfs)
---
Rastakhans Rumble: I have 9 legendaries, and 16 epics. Important cards I'm missing and might still craft are: Zul'jin for legendaries. And Masters Call for Epics.
---
Rise of Shadows: I have 8 legendaries, and 22 epics. Important cards I'm missing and might still craft are: Khadgar, Swampqueen Hagatha, Chef Nomi, Archivist Elysiana for legendaries. And for Epics: Omega Devastator and Magic Carpet. 
---
Saviours of Uldum: I have 7 legendaries, and 16 epics. I don't know what to get yet, I got zero Highlander Legendaries and Zephrys is definately on the list. But I'll wait a bit for the meta to settle before deciding.
---
If I disenchant my duplicates and disenchant all my duplicate golden cards I'll sit with 40k dust. This is quite enough to craft the cards I feel I still need, but I haven't had the motivation to dust my golden cards yet. I don't really play enough. I don't disenchant my Wild cards as I play Wild a lot. I've noticed I usually craft cards after they have rotated more often then crafting them while they are in Standard...
---
So my point really is, if I want I can craft all the T1 decks now, but can I do that every expansion? No I won't, at some point I'll run out of dust. I usually craft one T1 deck and a few fun Rogue decks (if the Rogue decks are T1 then I save on dust) and that has allowed me to build a bit of dust up which I've used to craft some fun Wild decks. I've crafted some niece Rogue and neatral  legendaries in the past and usually either after they rotated or just before they rotated, but it doesn't bother me. I have my fun in Wild and a lot of the Wild T1 decks I'm just 2-3 cards short of completing them, so I don't feel to far left behind. I just need to decide which decks to invest in and make peace with the ones I'll never play. (RIP 20k dust Mage....)
---
oml just play me in a duel and we can test this out
---
Sure I guess. Pm me ur battle thing
---
Actually, it is Moorabi. It's not his fault he was born in the wrong class.
---
I mean not really, look at the win rates for pocket on 5 and 6. The difference in power between a coin galaxy on 4 vs a coin galaxy on 5 is very large.
---
interesting to see naga sand witch. i feel like the card is really bad and most of the time it's a dead card.
---
I made the mistake of playing today. Most I have played all week. I got 6 Mages and lost to them all but one on turn 4-5 but stupidly decided to keep playing. I played about 12 games and decided that was enough. I might even just take the week off and only do quests until the nerfs.
---
No but u have to attack with minion first. And Zeph will realized that u have all attacked and offer u fireball.
---
Zeph need some setup for it to work as ‚Äòperfect‚Äô card
---
Was that much stronger than turn 8 justicar?
---
It takes 10 games (7-3) to go infinite in Arena, so you can do about 1,5 run (so 1,5 pack) per 2 hours if you average 7 wins. You can get more if you do even better, but it's already really hard to average 7 wins. Combined with quests I'd estimate that a skilled player that plays 2 hours per day will get about 2-2,5 packs per day.
---
I mean the third expansion this year is pretty much all but confirmed as a heavy dragon themed expansion. There is a good chance that is coming down the line shortly for priest, so that gives me some hope.
---

---

---
I think the big thing back then was that warrior only had brawl as a board clear ans 4-6 other removal tools with shield slam, execute, and then what ever other tech removal would be put in. Compared with modern warrior who currently have 6 board clears and 6 very good removal options.
---
&gt; only improved the winrate of the decks that used it by 1-2
---
Pretty sure Justicar made control warrior and paladin a lot stronger than 1-2%
---
can someone tell me why we are suddenly seeing jaraxxus posts? did i miss something?
---
It's Nerf or nothing, boys.
---
Many BAD overload cards are odd. Many aggressive overload cards that are good are even (totem golem, crackle, 4/7/7, vessina, thunderhead, zap, likkim, fireguard destroyer, jade claws, sandstorm elemental...) and very few are odd and good (trogg, lighting and lava burst). Combine that with even shaman having access to good totem support in totem carver and the thing from below, and you have a deck that preffers to run Genn instead of trogg. And I didn't even mention the specific even shaman support card (the lighting eel, great card that you can only run in even shaman).
---
They run jade lighting because they run jade cards and they need board pressence. The same reason they run portal. 
---
So, of course people play even shaman instead of overload aggro shaman. That doesn't mean tunnel trogg is bad.
---
And again, you are missing the point. Eterniun rover and town crier are far from being the best 1 drops in the game, as the comment I originally replied claimed. You are just rambling about other stuff that's not relevant to the topic.
---
Mysterious Challenger should have been it, but that's not in standard.
---
100% agree.  Swing turns and big plays are what HS should be about.  Not stalling for 15 turns and then killing me at 30 health from cards in hand or other goofy crap.  Thats an awful game experience.  Agree too about tghe battlecry thing.  far too many cards are deemed "vanilla" and never get used for the exact reason of that they "dont effect the board" right away.
---
Why, Healthcap? Just make it ‚Äúheal‚Äù to 15 and go from there.
---
Then that's what they should do
---
Don‚Äôt do it. Those golden 6/6s are worth it!
---
WOO WOOOOOO!
---
He also posted it on reddit so he could stir up outrage.  Should I be posting on reddit when my uber eats deliveries take 2hrs to arrive and I get no compensation?
---
The only niche with Jaraxxus now is if your opponent gets you to 8 or so hp but you manage to clear the board somehow without using any mana and get out of lethal range
---
So you basically hate this game yet pre ordered? Yeah, that helps.
---
Sorcerer's apprentice can no longer reduce spells to 0
---
We are talking about HoF which removes cards from Basic/Classic which means he can no longer generate him ehich makes him weaker.

He has a weapon, too. It would be 3, then 6+3, then 12+3, and a last hit to 30. But that‚Äôs assuming no taunt, no lifesteal, no armor.

He‚Äôs trash and needs improved.
---
LoL I'm F2P and have all those legendaries opened , also have Princess Talanji and Zerek Master Cloner , and gallery . how can I add them.

I don‚Äôt, mana cost nerfs always hits harder than people expect
---
You lost that bet.
---
oger
---
Card games go in cycles.
---
This sort of thing has happened to MtG at least three times, and the game as always bounced back despite the set-back.
---
How about 5 mana the next 5 (or so) minions you draw cost 1, instead of reducing ALL of them to 1?
---
That's actually a mountain giant nerf for mage, lol. Have fun with your 3-1 twilight drakes Kappa
---
So first you claimed to be effected and you didn't even know how long it lasted now you're a mind reader and know OPs intentions. Lol who's the one outraged here?
---
He was good back in the day. Like really really good. Right now tho he is unplayable. 
---
If you want to make him better, drop his mana cost honestly or give him some armor on 1st use. 
---
9 mana is very awkward to play him with
---
That doesn't matter. It was still done for balance. There were no mechanical changes.
---
I understand. Having access to all cards for meta shifts would be essential if you wanted to qualify for $ paying tournaments, right?
---
There are 5 different decks from different classes all in Tier 1 on HS replay. 2 aggro, a control, a midrange, and a combo deck. This is as diverse a meta as I have ever seen. Obviously every deck is going to have bad matchups.
---
I am amused how you say ‚Äútime to deal with this nonsense and focus on the real issues‚Äù. Do you really think it would take so much effort and resourses to give away that compensation? Additionally, do you really think they are working on anything besides printing cards every 4 months? Even though I am not a fan of flooding the subreddit with the same questions, I still don‚Äôt understand why you find it weird that people ask to compensate that 100-150 gold simply removed from their account. It‚Äôs not a big deal, but compensate it is not a big deal either and would take 5 seconds - it‚Äôs just another confirmation that blizzard treats their players like nothing.
---
&gt; SN1P-SN4P, Zilliax
---
They're fine.
---
They won't nerf the rest though. So I'll settle for a high roll card nerfed. I'd obviously prefer a better nerf, but it ain't happening.
---
Hilarious
---
There was only one legendary quest, as I understand it.
---
The issue is, folks stopped getting their normal daily quests the day after the legendary quest happened. It happened to me, completed only the legendary quest and ended the day with 2 quests. Next day, still 2 quests. Day after, still 2 quests. Third day, problem solved, got my quest as usual every day since.
---
My golden one says yes please
---
Demand better from the people you pay millions.

My quests are fine but still, I DEMAND FREE PACKS.

---
Sorry I fail to see the need for compensation here.  If game devs had to compensate end users for every minor bug that created a ‚Äònegative‚Äô experience they would go out of business.  If I‚Äôm understanding the issue here the user simply didn‚Äôt get daily quests for a day or two - the game still worked fine, they could use the cards they had purchased or earned in game, they simply didn‚Äôt get a days worth of in game currency, which there is no guarantee they would have earned anyway.  Why would Blizzard, a publicly traded business give away potential revenue for this.   The game is already free... this should be posted in /r/choosingbeggers
---
&gt; Most people that don't speak the language can instantly tell the difference.
---
Uh, yes? One uses Hiragana and Katakana, one doesn't.
---
That's true but in terms of tournaments that do matter, access to the best possible decks would be a must, right?
---
You are wrong, Golden Cards are for P2W Swag Whales. The button we really need is the "Degild" button. I fucking hate having one golden and one non-golden copy.
---
Remember that blizzard invitational where streamers would get packs depending on how many players equip a certain card pack?I remember kripp opening jaraxus in that one and totally beating a lot of the other players
---
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd do this based purely on the fact that Dr Boom is important to the flavor of all the expansions this year
---
That's the point, they nerfed it just as it was rotating out
---
The additional content and consistent balance updates are what got me to come back to it.
---
Harder to build a board and freeze all your opponents stuff at 6 mana.
---
Very fair forgot sleep with the fishes and bouncing blade.
---
Your average is silly. Including expansions that didn‚Äôt have balance changes treats them as expansions that had balance patches on day 1, which is obviously not true. You should divide the total by 12 (the number of expansions with balance changes) to get an average of 54.
---
Be careful how you treat missing data.

Bonemare got nerfed a set and a half later. Introduced in KFT and nerfed about 2 months after KnC launch.  Corridor Creeper was introduced in KFT and nerfed alongside Bonemare about 1.5 months after it's release. 
---
Spreading Plague was nerfed about a month after release but I think it was delayed because some Hearthstone tournament was going on so it might have actually been closer to 1.5 months.

&gt; I don't owe them (the corporation) gratitude just because I got something for free - the same way I'm not going to be grateful for free sample I got somwhere.
---
The comparison to a free sample is pretty off base considering how substantial the "something for free" is with Hearthstone. The vast, vast majority of what I post in their defense is in response to people who make uninformed, disingenuous, or toxic complaints. I'm not paying gratitude. Saying one of the reasons I defend the game is because it's free wasn't me saying I felt I owed them something. I would do the same for anything I cared about, free or not.
---
&gt;Basically I'm trying to say that in game economy is just the consequence of how people are doing, what they find fun, how well they manage their resources - not the other way around.
---
Sure, but I think it's important to consider the difference between how people *are* doing and how they *could* be doing under the same conditions if they the players made small changes. Big changes to the game itself like altering disenchant rates like OP was implying seem way too radical considering how much better some players could be doing if they simply took responsibility over their resources and made better use of them. The economy absolutely should be a consequence of the status of the players, but for a lot of them, there's more to that status than the positions they've put themselves in. Any alteration to the game's economy needs to take that into consideration, and I don't think that leaves much room for big changes people tend to ask for.

Boom ends games on its own. Luna is a turn 5 do nothing at the time and needs card draw to make it insane.

Yeah thanks but no thanks. I will wait to see if there is a balance patch and what the changes will be. Tired of giving money to a company that does not care about their playerbase ( missing quests and other things)

Okay, this one's not even in the same comic universe.
---
i DISAGREE!
---
&gt;just some random fan letter someone wrote
---
Nope. That post reached the top of r/apexlegends and was heavily gilded. People actually agreed with that sort of melodramatic response.
---
I'm just mocking the outrage culture perpetuated by Gamers‚Ñ¢ .
---
I honestly don't think blastmaster is that good. You have to play a particular archetype and have them not draw the bombs to get good value from it. And the stats aren't crazy for the meta like they were when the original Boom came out. Bomb warrior is strong because the entire package is strong, with the strongest card being the hero card.
---
Wow we don't even get 20 dust here
---
I felt the same about my deck, but I guess most of the cards were good-value, and also as a Warlock card draw is not a problem.

How does 20x Innervate and 10x Blood of the Ancient one sound
---
They are really gearing up the development on this game, thx blizz!
---
The thing is, if Priest doesn't play the combo then he's probably not being proactive at all and just trying to win on attrition, but the class currently lacks card generation to do so, which used to be one of it's core strenghts. 
---
In result to that we are once again throwing high health things on the board and hoping something sticks in order to be able to DS+IF and go face. As someone who used to love playing Priest, I'm just tired to see the class being forced into this playstyle although is pretty much the only shot at competitive viability it generally has.
---
The sac pact kill is a joke interaction because no one would run that card in their deck so the chance of it happening was too low. But now that team 5 have exploited their best keyword to hell(discover) we‚Äôve reached a point where sac pact killing you isn‚Äôt a trodden highlight

Careful, you're giving me flashbacks to Game of Thrones season 8.

Cool thanks, I got the druid quest lol

Should be, maybe restart.
---
I have to craft him, was told its the best card in the game
---
Same! He was my golden legendary that came with it. Considered the preorder a win immediately.
---
It wouldn't work like that in europe. Here the "spirit of the law" is the most important thing and selling dust clearly circumvents the spirit of the law and thus would still make it illegal.
---
That will never work, how would u price summoned/recruit minions? Are they 0 cost?
---
As far as I can tell, he ignores friendly minions that can't attack "right now", if it's frozen, has zero attack, has "can't attack", or has a conditional attack that hasn't been met zephrys ignores them

you are high health and not in danger of dying.....jones next turn is better than ooze.

https://imgur.com/a/8ycHun7 0 legendaries from packs and only 3 epics
---
Holy shit that‚Äôs actually pretty easy to pull off!!
---
The reason its historically lock is because of life tap. Paladin can drop it early with 2 crystologies or mage with book of spectres if you dont hit a spell. However, then you add an extra variable to the equation and your consistency goes down. Even then, hand lock hasn't been relevant outside of even lock in forever because they give up too much for the ability to slam an 8/8 on 4 which usually isn't game winning on its own in 2019. Evenlock uniquely had access to the 1 cost hp for even more consistency and the absurd warlock knc set plus defile which allowed them to survive which isn't really possible anymore.
---
It‚Äôs Blizzard mid animation
---
giving every player 3 packs probably means they sell about 200k less packs for real money
---
I did the same with Shadowverse, they are usually wanting to make the playerbase feel appreciated, so i appreciate them back, the deals are awesome and it feels good to spend money on those packs (they are 8 cards and abimated cards are faaar more commom).
---
HS does the opposite, i bought once, had a bad experience and packs felt overpriced for what they give so i never bought again. The team doesn't make me feel appreciated so i wont be buying anything from them.
---
Thanks for the constructive post.
---
Expensive but looks fun
---
how do you play a turn 1 mountain giant? this new one doesn't have any text on it
---
How is that different from the new druid combo? That would literally break the game as it is. That kind of concept would cause such an uproar. Also why does jaraxus have anything to do with that? Also, think about warrior too. It would need a hero power rework cus now its useless

9/7/7 | Battlecry: Discover 5 cards. Replace your deck with 2 copies of each.  
---
That looks amazing! Did you make the card, too?
---
Not only sac pact, but Repentance also reduces Jaraxxus's HP to 1 on play, but there's also a ton of cards that doesn't affect Jaraxxus even thought it's "considered a minion". It's overall a very weird card that has very inconsistent interactions.
---
This was posted the day unstable evolution was announced

I thought this is some legendary from some older expansion I missed... Good job!

3 legendary, 4 epic (one being golden). Not bad, friendo :3
---

Nice if you play against mage that does have a big board of 8/8s on turn 4 :\^)
---
Hunter's a completely fine deck to play imo.   
---
On another point, I fucking love possums. :D
---
Well, I'd suggest you to check Wild until the next patch, as it is in a surprisingly healthy place right now (roughly speaking), but judging by your last sentence, you probably won't let anyone change your mind about the format.
---
Was not aware.  Thanks!
---
Ok, but you cannot argue this is a change to sonya and not caverns below.
---
In every world where sonya exists and caverns doesnt, sonya has unchanged interactions. This is not true for caverns.

REALLY love the art and well thought out since she is a Draenei and I believe she is studying a book from the Na'aru.
---
The flavor of this card fits perfectly to what she did for the Draenei and the Naaru.
---
Overall, you did great and hope to see more of this type of post (art and card design) in the future.
---
Laughs in pretty much everything else
---
You won't have every relevant card, but you don't need every relevant card. I don't spend any money and normally have 2-3 tier 1 or 2 decks available. One factor to consider though is new players won't have much of the classic set, whereas old players typically have all of the relevant cards from the classic set, which helps a lot when building decks.
---
Everyone is gonna hate this answer but it is the correct one.
---
Just play like 25 Murloc Tidecallers and 5 Stargazer Lunas.
---
If it has the effect zeph should offer it. But yeah, perhaps they should ditch the effect.

i really really dislike seeing created by. cyclone mage beig encouraged to dump its hand, lackeys, all of it. But even I think Zephyr is fine its a legendary in a singelton deck that otherwise wouldnt really have much a wincon. it helps give some consistency in decks that bave historically had issues with it and its not really random, you can know what was offeredor at least have an idea what the opponent would choose to get a read

I think you shouldn't be leaking information that isn't released yet.
---
Correct - this minion won't move into the pool of 'dead minions that can be resurrected' until after the deathrattle has resolved so it can't summon itself unless a copy has died on a previous turn. Obviously if you were putting this in a deck you'd combo it with Seance etc to end up with a board full of them.
---
I like it very much. I'll take the liberty of criticizing a few points, but I'll just say I mean this as points of improvement and to encourage you to continue, I don't mean to knock your art down:
---
\- her right-hand fingers are weirdly boney at the joints, maybe they should be smoothed out a little? 
---
\- her left shoulder armour feels a little dislocated from her arm, as if it's scraping the front of her shoulder
---
\- the pink glow inside her left sleeve seems to come from the inside? is this elbow magic?
---
\- there's a red dot on her left ear that I can't understand what it is - is it supposed to be an earring? 
---
I know these are nitpicks but again, nitpicks are a sign of a job well done. Keep it up!
---
that doesn't make any sense though. in what world would you rather summon a 3/4 Deathrattle: summon a big dude vs just summoning a big dude? the battlecry isnt even that good either, you'd rather just have a spell that resurrects something for the vargoth synergy
---
Brawl looks like great guess. It seems to me they might be trying to steer away from board clears as they may not be fun to play against. My only clue being they Hall of Famed Vanish, soo... yeah.
---
fucking making different accounts and upvoting themselves such noobshits
---
I saw what it said. I agree(d) with what you said. Which makes it even funnier that this moronic subreddit will upvote someone, then immediately downvote someone for agreeing with the person who they upvoted. Lol.
---
No but i could see the set both players to 5 mana guy being good in that
---
I agree with the need to move past refunds.  The most important thing for a game should be that it's fun.    
---
The fact that Blizzard has to weight the "fun" of the game against money concerns over refunds is really goofy.  I'd be okay with getting rid of dust refunds in exchange for more frequent and radical changes to balance.    
---
The biggest thing I like in adjustments is that it would allow cards to change several times, until it finds a sweet spot.  Right now, Blizzard nerfs to oblivion because they don't want to risk giving more than one refund per card.
---
vaicine#2926 EU trading 80g quest
---
I agree. Sac pact is in virtually every Warlock, so long as that's a kill card for him, bo way does he see consistent play.
---
He also messes up your Voidcallers and sense demons, and you'd only want him out AFTER you Gul'dan, in which case why not expired merchant for more Gul'dans?
---
Ideally not the greatest I suppose, but it gets you closer to your next legendary. Plus, you can always have a pity timer card tracking app or be old school and keep tally of it on a piece of paper like me XD.
---
But it *does* somehow make revive priest even stronger, so...
---
They got my money too lol
---
Very cool. Making me want to play WoW again!
---
That's alright, i can play around it.
---
I also agree with moving past dust refunds as long as that would make the devs far more active when buffing and nerfing cards, but since that would never happen, I think refunds are the right policy.
---
Looks legit.
---
Yeah.. that's kind of how every aggro deck works.  If your opponent has the answers you lose.
---
Found the mage main guys.
---
Red dot, do you mean the triangle? I think that was supposed to be light shining through the flesh, like if you put your finger to a flashlight it's red.
---
7 and 5 years
---
I misread it, sorry. I agree with you for the most part but I think this situation isn't because people are unhappy with Hearth stone, I think it's more that different people are complaining about different things.  
---
(Then a subgroup of people complain about anything anyone else complains about)
---
This would actually make a lot of sense. It would be consistent with how minions keep buffs between zones, why should the "cost reduction"-buff be any different?
---
Yeah, but if we're talking -smart-, then it should at least offer both direct damage &amp; healing.  In this scenario, it offers no alternative paths for lethal, which is ultimately the goal of the game, but it does offer solutions for not-dying, which is important, but should be less prioritized than outright winning.  Again, it's smart in a way, but not smart in another way.
---
You can look at another type of software which functions similarly, which is chess engine simulators.  What these will do is calculate future moves, and they will provide to you a list of possible moves, sorted by the moves that it deems are the strongest in the future.  If it sees a checkmate opportunity, every single checkmate pathway will instantly be higher than other move in which you don't die next turn.  This should be the same case, where-in all the possibilities and additional cards that can grant you lethal are more important than cards that don't grant you an immediate lethal.
---

---
Didn't even realize how busted zephyrs + vanish would be if you could get it. That would be frustrating as hell to play against.
---
What would evolve in standard rly lose? And in wild there are enough targets.
---
There was no question posed, so there's no "answer", but see my reply as to why not offering alternative means to lethal is less intelligent than offering healing.
---
Which also penetrates taunt minions, mind you.
---
They actually thought it was a joke when someone asked why do we not get dust refunds for it.
---
I know how aggro decks work. I thought you were trying to make the case that this would be a competitively viable deck.
---
Works too well with big priest thanks I hate it
---
So you black out your name but not the oppoents? This is clearly against the rules here...
---
The most important thing in Hearhstone is tempo. Tempo means, most efficiently playing stts onto the board and/or removing stats from your opponent. A turn like Espionage or LPG¬¥doesn't do any of it. Espionage does not even guarantee you to gain the tempo back later, because you don't really know what you will get. LPG decks can swing the boardstate immensely, because you can couple removal spells with stat gain.
---
The art and style is beautiful and spot on, the picture is though very boring.
---
Yay! Someone that understands the artwork need to able to be framed in the card.
---
Didn't even get the most important
---
part.

&gt;  Its about the fact that F2P players need to scrape together every last gold piece to be able to play even remotely competitively in this F2P game.

I‚Äôd say restless mummy should be the first to go. The reborn effect is nice but I almost always used the rush cards to trade and milita commander staying on board after rushing made it much better overall than mummy besides in fringe situations you‚Äôd need to do 6 dmg or deal 3 once or twice to minions. Wasp is actually pretty good especially as a turn 2 play into turn 3 inner rage or taskmaster, hitting face for 6 with a 2 mana minion makes your opponent start to panic
---
boy, patience is everything :)
---
9, played since 2 months before launch (open beta)
---
Such a good idea and it could only but really increase the amount of dust spent imo.  
---
If you don't have a copy and wanted golden Blizzard misses out on nothing and if people previously crated a copy Blizzard miss out on nothing.  
---
Only if you got lucky to get a copy from a pack and would have dusted it to craft a golden anyway (which would be what ? .001% of players who got a copy in a pack) would they actually miss out on the 1600 dust.
---
That's fine, the deck is built around pocket galaxy, and if you are able to play it, then your expensive minions that you've built your deck around should be costing 1 and being able to bring huge advantages for you. Overall the problem is mana cheating and then conjurers double dipping/triple/quadruple dipping on the mana cheating. 
---
Kripp discusses it in his video: 
---
https://youtu.be/ec5sQM37aHY?t=663
---
Yeah I complained too and they basically said "too bad :/ can't do anything though"
---
I think 3-5 packs and a golden legendary of your own choosing would be a fitting compensation
---
So THAT'S what the 500+ MB update I got last week was for!
---
Because he was the first and printed in a less powerful time.
---
The posters context is not wanting to pay money due to value and you strawman that to into not enjoying playing the game? GG.
---
&gt;Should they refund the dust? Probably, but it opens them up to people demanding dust refunds if they ever need to change mechanics in the future.
---
I mean, if they materially worsen other cards in the future by altering mechanics, then I'd suggest those cards would deserve refunds too.
---
??? F2P players always have 1-2 top tier 1 decks. No one said you cant legend with F2P. In fact people hit legend with 2 days old new accounts.
---
You may not feel like it but sorry, you have been. ;)
---
Omega Devastator x4, Tomb Warden x3, Brawl x2, Shield Slam x2, Ziliax x2, Armagedillo x2, Dr Boom x1.
---
Who thought this was a good idea?
---
I wish this would be real...Seance on her, perpetual astral tiger. 
---
Or that warlock Soulwarden. Skip the return to hand phase
---
That still resulted in a low winrate deck
---
Isn‚Äôt this just a bad Sea Giant as it effectively starts at 17 mana? Lmao

---
Priest is out of last place for two weeks and people want it to be nerfed.
---
But nothing on hunter? Lol.
---
Those are noob figures lol
---
Yes mate when someone ropes you on 9 health and then uses pyroblast they really had to weigh up their options aha also stuff like that doesn‚Äôt bother me because hearthstone is something I play while watching movies etc my point was just that emoting can be muted so makes no sense to get angry. It‚Äôs the same thing in games like dota and league where people get angry when people bm ‚Äòez‚Äô at the end of games as if it‚Äôs some injustice
---
Well, you could change the Mountain Giant to cost 3 and "this card costs one more for each empty space in your hand", so if you have 1 card, it would cost 12 (9 empty spaces in your hand).
---
I would much prefer nerfs to Eternium Rover and Town Crier as opposed to Boom.
---
And just because a deck is good doesn't mean it needs nerfs. Priest is fine right now.
---
Highly possibly tbh lol
---
And 2 mana to spare ‚Äúwell fought,  iÃ∂ concede‚Äù
---
Quest shaman is gonna be much stronger after the nerfs I bet. So much value.
---
Please just don‚Äôt touch Cleric. Northshire and Power Word Shield is all we Priests have.
---
I suggest to only refund players who crafted the card. Problem solved.
---
Oh wow with all that dust you can build A deck
---
Hmmm i think i might just make the jump then, gettin real tired of buying standard every new expansion.
---
if they make a him a permanent normal hero , the warlock would kinda become busted everytime that a new year comes in since he will always have a hero card
---
It‚Äôs the highest rank in hearthstone
---
Honestly thought this was real card art for a sec, amazing job
---
You can still cast conjurers calling on mountain giant, best give it can't be targeted by spells or hero powers as well
---
That's a pretty great point.
---
tbh I could definitely see blizzard lowering the deck slots and making you buy them
---
Did you craft the card?
---
Academic espionage is completely RNG and often ruins a deck hence the low win rate.  
---
LPG on the other hand is constructed decks getting a discount which is why it's considered so strong and indeed overpowered even by pros playing the game.
---
Let me try that üòä, trying to get that new bundle üòÇ
---
I should have clarified but I was mostly just thinking of making a couple top tier decks but from what I‚Äôm seeing it shouldn‚Äôt cost me too much since i already have some of the big cards.
---
We did
---
So your entire deck is call to arms, prismatic lense, and 26 millhouses?
---
How did you get the Colossus and High Priest Amet though? There was only one legendary from Saviors of Uldum...
---
They made 50g quests the minimum and then reduced the chance of receiving a 60g quest. It averages out to about the same per day
---
I like it
---
I like that Khadgar wannabe on the left
---
It's not that it's good.  It's that it's comparative power will skyrocket because the good decks around it all drop. No deck will really balance it because you brought down the power level of the best other decks.  (According to VS, its the #1 deck right now...what happens when the #2/#3 decks get nerfed?  Gap widens).
---
Companies typically don't like doing this because the OC sometimes wants to claim the work
---
They merged 11 years ago...6 years before Hearthstone was even released
---
The least fun mechanic in hearthstone is cheating the mana cost of cards.
---
Oh, my mistake. You mean the legendary that inner fires your deck - Lady in White - and not the legendary used in the inner fire priest deck.
---
My bad
---
No I mean the inner fire one from the old expansion lol I forgot her name but it literally says cast "inner fire" on all your minions in deck.
---
Luckily I got Amet as my golden Leg from the bundle. 
---
Amet and tekhan are my only golden leggies
---
Where the nerfs at
---
UM... FUCK
---
WAIT, DOES THAT COUNT AS CONSENT???
---
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER, I HAVE TO AGREE.
---
And finally [[Shadowstep]] and [[Sonya Shadowdancer]] would work with [[Magic Carpet]] (again?). I would really like this change. Would be great for the consistency of hearthstone interactions.
---
The wild 35 legendary deck isn't thhaaat bad nowadays
---
I second this motion
---
So we're just changing mountain giant back to a 12 drop once calling rotates to wild, right?

It would be nice if the class had strengths, too, instead of a new board wipe every 6 months.
---
I intend to!
---
I got the treasure that gives your minions rush and went greedy with demons. I knew if I survived the early game I would win.
---
Explain Equality then, big guy.
---
Right, high mana cost minions that are played either have immediate impact on the board or provide some value.
---
If they refund all of the dusted Millhouse I have openned since launch, I could make that deck though. PepeHands I also opened 3 Natpale and 2 Cho...
---
Well yes i tought you were playing standard. 
---
You should probably try renolock or any other highlander control decks.
---
Man i got wrecked by *Soggoth* in Big Priest two days ago. This would see some experimentation for sure. It would probably end up a lot better than our dear Blackrock Emperor that some Big Priests seem hellbent on running...
---
I‚Äôm not sure this really fixes the problem tho and it goes against his flavor
---
I mean, true, but Rogue has combo cards to take advantage of the card advantage normally lost by running low impact cards, increasing the impact of backstab, sometimes significantly.
---
That shit looks blizz-like! Amazing job!
---
Nice Kubrick reference.

Trading quest (80g) - Ryflect#1721 NA, I show, you go first

One of the better ones in wild.

In general I went on hsreplay to look at highlander hunter lists, there was a new best performing list every day, but in general, the cards that I‚Äôve seen taken out that I would leave in: sandbinder, hunters pack, lifedrinker, siamat. There are of course the essentials, like the secret package, unleash the beast and zuljin, kill command and animal companion. Some interesting choices that I‚Äôve seen work have been houndmaster Shaw and surprisingly long krush (you can get some good lethals) and one of the cards that I‚Äôve always been on the fence about is unleash the hounds, it‚Äôs a pretty good card but most of the time it‚Äôs very mediocre, I ran it when I hit legend but it‚Äôs something to think about

I love your point 7, I fall into this trap myself all the time.

That's why I usually play every game till the end but when I have an unfavourable matchup with a deck against control warrior I concede if I don't have good early and mid-game.Playing afterwards is just a waste of time because the OP omega cards (which are mostly just good,except for warrior's) and Dr.Boom aka the only hero card on par with DK power level in standard just give them an absurd advantage.
---
Mage has absurd mana cheating tools,that's why they can withstand and beat warriors.
---
I think mages and warriors have just warped the meta so much that any deck needs to either have a ridiculously strong mana cheating gimmick(like the best paladin decks),incredible amount of value,an oppressing amount of counterplay and pressure or "just" an 40+ otk deck with plenty of healing.
---
Scammer MegaMilk#11244 on US shows first, no trade
---
You're a moron.
---
It‚Äôs very fun yes
---
Bro I thought it was an actual card u copied and just finished the background
---
The card is limited to basic and classic cards only, so you start with a hard limit. Given that, many choices will be discarded from the jump. It's much more feasible to do when you look at just the classic set.
---
I doubt he has either, and if you don't want to play expensive decks, there are ether budget versions (I'd only call three of the six or seven legendary cards that deck plays vital) or other, cheaper decks to play with.
---
It's never easy or even a good idea to dive head first into building the most expensive deck you can in a card game when you're just starting out.
---
So it‚Äôs like worse Forbidden Ancient?
---
&gt;it‚Äôs a feature offered for free!
---
Hol up a moment. It's a feature the game requires if they expect the f2p business model to work. Imagine if you're at that same bar, all the f2ps were hot ladies and the whales were rich blokes. It's a similar situation- by having a large playing population, the people who drop exorbitant amounts of money frequently have someone that can face off againt.
