This reminds me of Eater of Secrets. It was supposed to kill secret decks, but quite logically it doesn‚Äôt do that since when no one plays secrets anymore no one will play the Tech card anymore as well, and then you‚Äôre good to play secrets again.
---

---
So I expect combo decks to survive this for sure.

OP: "cheating out minions in wild is too consistent, my opponent has almost 50 mana worth of minions on turn 4, this isn't very fun."
---
You, for some reason: "BuT yOU hAvE a NinE dROp"
---
Yep. Looking back, I also think disenchanting for a ‚Äúfirst deck‚Äù can sometimes be a mistake, because most new players don‚Äôt have the skills yet to take advantage of the deck anyway. They are better off subbing in cards they do have and learning both why those cards are not as good and the basics of the game.

Even better, you can Power Word Replicate him, to make 4 Vargoths, and if they are not removed next turn, 2 Mind blasts equals 30 damage.
---
10 from the casted mind blasts and 20 from 1 mind blast per Vargoth.
---
And because you are Multiplying Vargoths you have increased chances of a Vargoth showing up on Mass Ressurection, meaning you have a increased chance of 2 Mass Ressurections on the same turn. 
---

---
now i am wondering what to do with the 14 remaining slots, maybe big wall package? 
---
fair cards rarely make it to the top
---
besides, the real game has plenty of cards that are insanely strong or overvalued 
---
Man this community is so damn bored waiting for the expansion...ffs
---
And what word would you pick for something that's annoying and awkward? Seems like a good choice to me
---
The card does read until the start of your next turn, you took 2 before his next. 
---

With danish beeing somewhere between english and german I guess a lot of people can understand a few words danish.

But this is just infinite heal, not stall. You could, with like 5 card combo, add more cards to your deck infinitily, but this is nothing like dead mans hand.
---
DMN was an easy combo to gain infinite armour and never take fatique which was easy to transform into extra resources on the long run.
---
This is at best, hard combo to suffle (infinitely) more cards into your deck, that if not assembled, doesn't add any extra cards into your deck.
---
The key difference is that it is much harder to stall for even a while. And we already have mechchtun so avoiding fatique forever wouldn't even make sense. Warlock can already just win with easier set-up, in a cituation where such tactic would be beneficial.

Goldshire Footman is a pretty bad card. This guy's opponent played a golden one turn one then emoted. OP made a thread with an overreacting title as a joke.
---
Vargoth seems like a card you play and try and extract value out of immediately. If you are playing a minion and then passing to you opponent you are taking a big risk, especially if its a combo piece. I do think it will be a good card in Priest I just don't think you play it until you can immediately do something with the effect. 
---
Turn 1? Maybe
---
That is the point 
---
The first step is basically passing. Unless you‚Äôre super ahead, you probably don‚Äôt have the time to set this up. Priest also frequently plays from behind, so while the concept is nice, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be legitimately viable. We need to see more cards before theory crafting.
---
To very, very quickly summarize the subreddit's general opinion: A two-person group is much better for these situations, as it allows conversation to flow more smoothly. No trying to include a third person. Someone above pointed out how sports commentators are normally two-person teams. Another argument put forward is why the community manager is involved with the reveal stream. There's a general lack of obvious connection. 
---
I'm not the guy you replied to, just noting some things I've seen. Personally, I'm all for giving it at least a second shot, although I do know of a few suggestions that got tossed around after the first Rise of Shadows stream if you care to hear them.
---
How could they do our boi anduin like that 
---
Tier 1, as in, this deck is ranked as being among the best in the game at the given time.
---
I thought priest was a class that's known for being able to get away with turns that are basically passing
---
always deathwing if that's your debate. Elise is a 5 mana 5/5 90% of the time.
---
How?
---
An intriguing combination, but has three obvious downsides.  1) Draw dependent on getting Vargoth and Velen.  If one is buried at the bottom of your deck you're in trouble.  2) Requires two turns that put a minion on the board, but otherwise do nothing.  3) Doesn't work against classes that armor beyond 30 health (unless they still don't manage to kill you or clear the board).
---
Probably also ran [[Boulderfist Ogre]]

You can dark pact this to heal for 12 for 3 mana. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretttttty good. Neutral healing is typically strong if it‚Äôs a consistent heal.

Not on turn 7+, that‚Äôs when they start doing stuff

Yeah, they do. And at some point is not even worth giving them a reason to do it more.

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPAsYTzi-iI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPAsYTzi-iI)

I‚Äôm confused , doesn‚Äôt that give your opponent a bunch of cards in their deck ?
---
Warrior will definitely experiment with this and deadmans hand.
---
Very poweful if not countered. Either 1-star or 5-star.
---
The card wasn't bad. It was not broken enough to be compared to Skull, Lackey, or even Kathrena. The total Warrior Recruit package was just too fair as it still managed to beat aggro but got rolled by other decks.
---
It‚Äôs a pretty funny joke, shoulda gone all out and made a fake looking hearthscan account
---
Seems pretty bad. I mean, compare this to the type of a shenanigans druids could pull with lots of taunts and one spider boi. 
---
A 4/8 taunt for 8 mana is weak and unless manage to rez it more than two or three times, sucky and bad.
---
But then it would get all the karma......
---
This has nothing to do with the art team. I meant being able to earn the card back that's in your ranked chest with games played in other modes than ranked.
---
I thought maybe tier 1?
---
Amazing work! Thanks for sharing your process.
---
Okay so about two days ago I was playing Casino mags and my opponent happened to be a shudder shaman. He had some infinite wild shudder combo that ran through for like 3 minutes each turn. Well as a casino mage I was naturally running the best boy Yogg and after he played about 3 shudderwocks in one turn I decided to just drop Yogg and see what happens. Well Yogg just so happened to play [[Gang Up!]] twice. He targeted the shudderwock both times and I ended up with my own shudder. The next turn I played my shudder and he played Yogg‚Äôs battlecry but since it was shudder playing it it was unnerfed. Turns became EXPONENTIALLY LONGER. Eventually my shudder plays spawned Hakkar. I killed Halkar and corrupted bloods shuffled into both of our decks that were fatigued. Except I had like 25 health and he had 30 health plus about 200 armor. Naturally I lost that round. But it was really long and SUPER meme worthy. I wish I had it on video.

2/-/- | Choose a minion. Shuffle 3 copies of it into your deck.  
---
The real card is actually way worse
---
Wait, what?
---
You can do it. I did one for the Rasta Pre-release. Is it discouraged?
---
The üÖ±Ô∏èancient one 
---
This card is frustrating. I know warrior has some tools left from the last three expansions but they really don't seem to getting anything this expansion other then some of the worst spells in the game and the bomb thing (which is hard countered by rouges shuffling in so many cards and 2 of other classes getting pushed towards heal archetypes). 
---
But this is support for a archetype that's leaving. This could have being interesting as a boomsday card to give recruit warrior one last chance to shine but now? I feel it only exists to make academic espionage better vs warriors.   
---
Mana doesn't scale linearly. A 3-mana 4/4 is pretty good. A 10-mana 13/13 is worthless.
---
10-mana cards that don't straight-up win the game rarely see play unless they can be cheated out. 
---
Keep in mind that this doesn't pull from your deck - it summons copies. 
---
What r u trying to say exactly? 
---
I don't play wild but wouldn't that mean you'll just eat another barnes next turn ?
---
lol
---
I dont get the reference 
---
Draw chicken turn 3, play it behind a taunt. Hit it with Blessing of Kings turn 4. Opponent instantly concedes to your poultry power.
---
its not like something like 1 mana UI, DKs and a fuck ton of big minions were already a thing. could and probably has been worse already. calm dowm.
---
oh boy cant wait to reach 20% winrate on this
---
I'm sorry, been gone from comp for a while, wgatvthe fuck is most of this list and I need the deck codes for the or Druid decks now.
---
Even standard can be pretty crazy, I was playing pogo rouge and got krawqa off a hallucination, I kept playing over and over due to the 0 mana spell that brings him back to my hand
---
To my side still isn't even good.  It was more "I guess throw it in there".
---
Stones hurt* ftfy
---
When To My Side was revealed people said that it would always be better to run minions.
---
A year later, we can look back and say they were exactly right because it was consistently outclassed by Secret, Hybrid, Midrange, and Deathrattle Hunter.
---
Actually really cool design. This expansion has a lot of variety. 
---
I can wait no longer
---
What? I‚Äôm not OP but fuck sakes if you aren‚Äôt an insufferable fresh prick.
---
And I hope you don‚Äôt bring up tenses in real life...uggh how annoying. Yuck.
---
I‚Äôm not on the hearthstone forum, but nice try.
---
This seems way too slow to use in a deck and I can't think of any big minions that Warrior has that would benefit from this spell 
---
NOT THE BAINCIENT ONE
---
So you‚Äôre agreeing that without Baku warrior will be worse? Insightful
---
Me neither, I googled it after seeing this post. Shows how unlucky I am with getting epics in my decks. Probably 4 more where this case from.
---
just a casual 749700 fatigue damage
---
HO-
---
That was a goddamn masterpiece 
---
Witchwood Piper is way better than the minstrel in academic deck, in my experience
---
So, I guess we‚Äôre about to find out whether a vanilla 10 mana 30/30 is good.
---
Support for the existing druid archetypes that don't see play now, mainly hand druid, tree druid, and attack druid.
---
JUST?
---
I didn't open her on any server, I'm sure she helps but she is far from "necessary"
---
But what about a 10 mana 30/30? *thinking emoji*
---
I‚Äôm not arguing over tenses! If someone asked me ‚Äúwas that the case‚Äù and I said ‚Äúno it wasn‚Äôt‚Äù
---
And then they said ‚Äúno I mean will it be the case‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm not being a dick about grammar, they aren‚Äôt speaking right
---
This isn‚Äôt a grammar thing at all lol
---
Honestly the dragon roars and demonbolts are annoying, but recent expansion op commons being abundant isnt new. Every game turning on fucking dragonslayer is what im tired of
---
This is probably why the new patch is introducing so many combo disruptors. This gets messed up by both the spell and minion disruptors since it requires 1 of each. (and it's not as easy as just keeping 2 copies of dead mans hand, but being able to shuffle your entire hand in your deck is pretty good)
---
Depends on the order of the triggers. As long as mecha'thun triggers before immortal prelate
---
Im a huge fan of Nozari, i just love effects like this regardless if he will be strong or not.
---
well all the stuff isn't revealed yet, hopefully something else appears. It also looks like vargoth straight up adds win conditions to the deck, so i wouldn't be surprised if there's some elaborate priest trick decks that appear that have enough bases covered to get consistent outcomes through more than one method of achieving the same thing
---
Wallet warrior even at its greediest I think only ran like 4 or 5 big threats. At that deck still probably wouldn't have wanted this card because it still had stuff like acolytes of pain and big-game hunters in it. Also the nerfed firey war axe seriously hurted that style of deck to exist in the first place.
---
And that version is from like 2015. The only deck that could have used this would have being the semi-viable low tier recruit warrior that's entire core is rotating out. 
---
THANK you. My first thought was what the fuck is wrong with her finger? It looks like a tiny banana.
---
pretty good wild card with swashbuckler.
---
Nifty combo for sure!
---
Will require either a good 'draw engine' or  'tutors' for the legendary cards. Its also reliant on Priest getting new board clears as these decks typically need effective ways to stale until you can draw the combo. 
---
Right? Shaman's gotten some good shit, I'm pretty confident about the state of the class when standard rolls around. They have by far the best value game out of any class when the rotations happen, which is something I never thought I would say about shaman. And then have some comparatively powerful tools everywhere else to compete. 
---
a shuffle into the deck-style legendary if it had some other effect would be a pretty good pull from this I admit.
---
3200 dust, or approximately $40 USD in dust :P
---
I would cut arcane intellect for elemental invocation and probably try to work one more elemental into the deck 
---
Same. Big fan of control warlock, DMH warrior, and fatigue decks in general.

I was thinking about that, giving those three groups access to multiple classes would be off, so with the hypothetical release of the format, Kazakus, Aya and Don would either have to be restricted as neutrals (boring), or compensated for with 3~6 new tri-class legendaries composed of other combinations of classes. As much as I like the second option, it has no drawbacks, and would easilily become unfair.
---
I think the best option is having, for example, Kazakus, be considered EITHER mage, warlock or priest when deckbuilding, to prevent class mixture. Basically, there would be 3 versions of Kazakus, which is fine.
---
I agree that warrior has a ton of strong tools, but I think how high your average minion cost needs this to be to be a good card is like 8+ and its hard to imagine a deck greedy enough that off that actually needs even more value
---
Because this is not "recruit"?
---
This card summon 2 COPY of a minion in your deck. Recruit summon a minion in your deck
---
Man have people forgotten about midrange. You dont need a straight win con to make a deck if it can stick on a board and smorc enough.
---
I SWEAR TO GOD, IM NOT KIDDING
---
well they gave it to Toast so it's his property
---
You get exacty what it would have costed you, so yes 3200.  
---
If you then decide to dust him because you won't play him, that's another 1600.  
---
I have a tinfoil-hat conspiracy theory of how Team 5 pushed Odd Warrior during the year of the raven as a way of steering Warrior away from Dead-Man's-Hand because they [didn't realize](https://www.gamecrate.com/interview-hearthstone-developers-discuss-their-nerfing-philosophy/18566 "tiqyawysrcbowgphk") people would use DMH to go infinite.
---
Probably should cut the meteoroligist, it's the weakest of the big hand cards. Replace it with arcane missiles or some cheap spell, you get the value back with manacyclone anyway.
---
Then you press the button on the top right corner and press the red button
---
wtf
---
He died lol
---
What's stale and boring about seeing nearly a dozen different builds routinely in the 5 to legend scene?
---
"Solving meta" does not exist because every deck has some strenghts and weaknesses. And there is always a deck that counters other decks considered by someone as "tier 1".
---
Yes, netdecking exists, archetypes appear vanish and change, some even find their way to wild ladder.  
---
Spell hunter was popular in december but now I do not see anyone playing him.
---
Another example is wall priest. Saw him only once in march.
---
Of course there are some "eternal" decks but they will always reincarnate unless classic set rotates.

Good point!
---
Any OTK combo deck is going to misfire some games if the combo cards at the bottom, that's just how they work. It's only 5 cards needed, that's not too uncommon in OTKs.
---
The real problem is the 2 turn setup before the actual kill.
---
I got to legend previous month and saw nothing except odd paladin, pirate rogue and big priest, such a fun little meta, right.
---
I am too, it was a good card back then, strong in aggro decks and hunter.  
---
The issue is that when primordial glyph was relevant, mage was way more oppressive. Shadow Visions NEEDED to be way better because it was one of the few cards keeping priest afloat at ALL. 
---
Primordial glyph on the other hand, combined the annoying idea of RNG-winning-games with an insanely good mana discount for the cost, in a class that was strong already. 
---
That's the difference. Context is, as always, important. 
---
Allie actually 50000000000 iq
---
Yeah maybe cut meteorologist for Frostbolt for some more stall
---
Jesus that card is so bad I forgot it even existed at one point
---
It likely was, they surely didn't intend to create something people would hate so much, though. From a balance standpoint it was always an average power level deck (it would probably become broken during the year of Raven if it wasn't for the nerfs, though). 
---
You realize dota is a map in warcraft3 right?
---
Like some sort of convoluted [[Rod Of Roasting]]
---
And here I thought that Warrior had no good pay off cards with Vargoth.
---
Ok, Big/recruit Warrior kind of stuff might be still a thing, after all. This doesn't thin your deck and just gives you two copies of one of your threats, but at the hefty sum of 10 mana. Not easily comboable, except with maybe coin+Whirlwind for Grom or Blackhowl Gunspire, well or double Inner Rage. Warrior's problem is that the class lost his best two fatties with the rotation, Yip and Rotface, and the neutral Lichking. We might go back to Ysera, Grom, Baron Geddon, though.
---
When I was playing today Vs druid he played landscaping and the treants were without art. Was it lagging or my phone has a problem?

You‚Äôre avoiding the main point, why does it matter if you dont know what a certain card( which you will not be able to access for a week) says?
---
You will not be able to use the card regardless.
---
Nice reference lul
---
It's the exact same thing though? Played MTGA since closed beta, like in Hearthstone you can grind out one deck for free relatively easily, but if you want a complete collection (which you don't need, just like in Hearthstone), you're looking at a couple hundred bucks per set too.
---
The previous MtG game, Duels, was much cheaper. In that game you could easily grind out each set and if you didn't want to grind it was something like $80 per set (Duels packs could only give you cards you didn't have enough of yet, and once you completed a set you could no longer obtain packs for it, meaning there was a hard cap on how much money you could spend on a set).
---
I have literally no respect for big priest players. If I face one I'll rope the whole game no matter what.
---
Think it'll be closer to 15
---
Can you demonstrate how anything I've edited would somehow change the context of our discussion? I'll wait...
---
For bonus points get a 1 mana azalina from pocket Galaxy, play your timewarp into Cho, and get another extra turn
---
Because I look forward to discussions and it's better if everyone knows what the card says from the get-go. 
---
Bigh hand combined with massive draw seems like miracle rogue/druid.
---
But there is a major difference that is you suggest running many high mana cost cards. 
---
My question is, if they are all necessary or we can cut something? 
---
You have a fucking weird definition of a cancer deck
---
How is it the same? Capping out your daily wins is so much faster in mtg and you get gold + 6 random cards. You can feel being rewarded compared to hearthstones shitty win 3 games for 10 gold..
---
Every priest deck that has existed is cancer but I gotta finish my priest quests somehow :(
---
FOOOOL!!
---
Still better than 60 on the next turn
---
I didn't say the edits change something in your favor or something, the thing is that I have no opportunity to answer all the points of your replies since you edit them so much.
---
Yes, if you forget the existing board and if you low roll on the die insect
---
When will be the final reveal stream?
---
Yes well the idea is nice, it's just that at least half the people watching the stream tuned in to see a card review. They didn't go there to wait until the promised time (that's a considerable wait already) then to wait on the streamer doing something irrelevant to them for minutes to half an hour. People have lives. Messing with people's times is irrespectful. So this puts the streamer into a bad position. I'd have loved to work on the box cause it's fun, but if people were waiting on me, I'd have torn it apart without hesitation.
---
Yea I mean Chef Nomi is probably a little bit bette in rogue, but this deck has more going for it than just that. It also has the summoning package with Khadgar.  Also can get insane value from Mana Cyclone in this deck. This deck can refill the board/hand better than rogue imo
---
Adapt is gone son
---
Has about as many combo pieces as quest mage only with a thirty damage limit. And right now priest has way fewer survival tools than quest mage had in it it's prime (iceblock), And I'm not sure quest mage ever averaged much more than fifty percent. It's going to struggle against aggro and any deck with armor. 
---
You'll get another Malchezar, you can have as many of the same legendary as you wish. 
---
I will play a 10 mana spell with Archmage Vargoth in my deck, and other reasonable things that can happen in Hearthstone
---
it used to have charge and be 4/2
---
I disagree. Only the rogue spell, rogue 'alextraza's champion' and forbidden words are competitively viable. Others are ok at best, which amounts to trash in wild. Very little will be changed.
---
r/whoosh
---
Dude it takes an hour max before we get a translation, just wait a bit, its not that difficult. 
---
Hell, some classes got multiple of those. Warrior got 3, though only Eternium Rover saw any serious play.
---
I mean that's either a very elaborate April Fools joke or you just have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Unless already have all legendaries from a set
---
The irony is blinding.

I'm hoping for a neat spell-beast deck in Rise of Shadows. My Zul'jin is ready.
---
Man, seeing trump toying around with the box, shaking it constantly and just touching it instead of doing some real advance was a nightmare, i stopped watching him after 15 min. 
---
Lol, thanks blizz but I'd rather buy packs directly.
---
I'm so happy, I was just trying this morning to make a Zuljin deck for post expac and just really needs a little more help.
---
Is this where [Dr. Morrigan] becomes viable?
---
No man she's actually insanely hot. Don't fool yourself.
---
We get Vargoth for free on April 5th, rotation happens on the 9th
---
Is it? I'm not playing big priests often. Tbh I don't think I even played one the last few weeks. But I just have a grudge for that deck.
---
Ya ever hear of the Gordian Knot? Toast took the path of least resistance. So far it‚Äôs been the most effective way of opening the damn thing. I watched Trump try for 40 minutes. 
---
SPELLS ARE FUN! SOOOOOOOO FUN! 
---
I might legit make a deck with it in wild
---
geiler name 
---
Nice! Can i have the decklist?
---
Well, they don't.
---
Wow that's incredibly bad
---
Thank you
---
My inner insect yu-ogi-oh player loves this card design. Give me more insects!
---
As a warlock card? No
---
The game doesn't give you enough gold for Arena to be casual.
---
Yes, the new whizbang in golden
---
What do you mean?
---
Why can you not run any other minions? Vargoth and big minions would work fine for this high roll scenario. And I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other warrior spells that could benefit from vargoth if you don‚Äôt get that high roll
---
You get a whizbang like card for finishing it. Why is it bad so far there was no reward for nonadventure singleplayer modes.
---
You üÖ±Ô∏èin
---
I don't think spell hunter will be very good with out Rexxar. It was there if you ran out of steam which happened alot
---
Is the bug that you got the packs, or that you got more packs then you purchased?
---
You sound like a dick though...does not compute...
---
You compare Hunter with Priest? Lol
---
Not rly. My list has no legendaries and 4 epics: Vivid Nightmare, Embrace the Shadow and two Psychic Screams.
---
You can replace Psychic Screams with any other aoe removal spell, although Psychic Scream definitely is the strongest imo.
---
Vivid Nightmare makes the combo more consistent because it's basically another Radiant Elemental for your combo once you've drawn the first one.
---
Embrace the Shadow is essential tho. I play with just one because I have just one, it's expensive and outside of this decklist you usually want the new 2 mana 3/2 minion with the same effect instead. Else I would have included a second one, but I usually find it in time, so I don't even know if a second one is recommended, let alone necessary.
---
*Spells are fun, sooo fun!*
---
If that triggers you, just don't add recent opponents. Simple.
---
Cause I have a grudge on a deck I rarely play? I for sure don't have the moral high ground here but I'm not a guy that adds people to insult em or spamms emotes.
---
[[Nightmare Amalgam]] saw mostly play as a dragon activator.
---
Is golden Marin uncraftable? How can someone obtain it then? 
---
Hey OP, can you gift me the expansion? I've done my research! 
---
Oracle has seen SOME play in Quest Priest. Synergies are the key here. This is both a cheap Beast AND a cheap Deathrattle card, so it might go into archetypes that care about those. Plus Priest and Hunter are completely different - Priest has a really easy time filling up the hand in most of the expansions, while Hunter doesn't. On the other hand, Priest doesn't necessarily care about the early game tempo, but Hunter does. Comparing cards from different classes with completely different play style makes absolutely no sense.
---
Webspinner also would see absolutely no play in Priest, and yet it was a Hunter staple for a long time. That's the point - cards can suck in X class and be good in Y class. I think that you're underrating the card significantly. Especially since Hunter is losing Dire Mole, so the class will really want a new 1-drop - Springpaw is just not the best thing to drop T1 since Rush rarely has any effect so early.
---
This card is broken. 4 Mana 5/5 on  three bodies with synergies.

Wish i could gild this
---
Me too!
---
In anticipation I transformed my wall priest deck into a hybrid wall/rez Priest that's standard legal. Not great but it puts in work.
---
So playing to win is bad because it makes you lose?
---
But the question is, will the amalgams be a small cute version of the last amalgam or will it be the same?
---
&gt; Did I miss any?
---
All the "Gain +/+ for every [minion type] you control] minions, as well as spells like [[Kill Command]]
---
bonkers in zoo agrro
---
Even with all the answers currently, I'm STILL confused as to where the joke actually is. I re-read the chat 5 times now. I don't see anything funny in there... :/
---
I know the WoW lore btw.

---
3/-/- | Deal 3 damage. If you control a Beast, deal 5 damage instead.  
---
Priest will be back to a similar position it‚Äôs in at the start of every rotation, pretty bad because its classic set of cards are weak.
---
You should get shudderwock back. In my experience hagatha's passive hero power always triggered after the battlecry. 
---
Mad that‚Äôs a free legendary right there 
---
Honestly a full heal card in a 100 card deck is not that threatening.  It might be slighly more busted in priest, druid, and/or paladin, considering cards like Amara, Tree of Life, or Nozomi respectively, HOWEVER, most people pop Reno when they have no other choice, which usually means the opponent has board control.  
---
Furthermore, given the sheer amount of disruption tools that are coming in Rise of Shadows, there is plenty of ways to potentially short-circuit Reno from ever going off.
---
Lackeys aren't a tribe/minion type
---
Wow, that might actually work.
---
Pretty interesting card tbh can see it in some token decks and great in arena 
---
ALL minions.
---
Thanks. Still not good enough to run this. Maybe more cards coming that support this or future support later in the year?
---
Is "lackey" a tribe?
---
They're not lackeys tho :(
---
I would say its a downgrade. Rarity is an isue. 
---
Well shit, you‚Äôre right, I took the most roundabout path to breaking even, lol. 
---
Huh? Where did I complain about loosing?
---
A 4 mana 5/5 that can't value trade is not really a 4 mana 5/5. 
---
Yeah that's weird. 
---
I also play those decks, to have fun
---
Right, but you‚Äôre not running this card just for zilliax.
---
It'll be a premium 4 drop whenever Rise of Shadows is in the arena meta. Meaning that all the tribal synergy cards that have been added to Hearthstone are going to become a lot more relevant.
---
9 mana though, the tokens will die before that most likely
---
1 mana 1/3? Too good. Let's add 1 mana, +2/+1, and rush.
---
Would be interesting to see a card that gives you these in hand as well, for the sake of dragons.
---
I haven't got the deck myself but haven't crafted it because it looks so boring to play
---
Ship's Cannon? Fires two shots from this.
---
R/ihadastroke  ?
---
Or even into Wargear, if you're running a mech package. 
---
That could be a solid tempo play after playing this on turn 4. Although [[Nightmare Amalgam]] usually sticks around for a turn and has better stats for the mana cost. A thing to think about though. 
---
Lackeys aren't a tribe, they're a specific (random) token, like mechanical parts.
---
It was a virtual ticket bonus. Probably meant to be exclusive.
---
[[Menagerie Magician]] would work well with this.
---
Arthas as a DK says "For the Lich King!". 
---
Only because Genn and Baku were HoFed. If they didn't it would be a repeat of last year.
---
Set sails Thief Rogue! Tier 1 here we come!
---
Whilst you might be right about needing a full set (I have the full classic set), the only classic legendaries I get now are ones that I have only in golden. I don‚Äôt get any classic legendary I‚Äôve only got in normal.
---
Looking at our choices, there‚Äôs plenty of cards that are nice to get for free.
---
Hunter‚Äôs Mark, Kill Command, Dire Frenzy, the secrets, Baited Arrow off the top of my head.
---
Crystal Oracle was seen as a good card. This will see play for sure.

R.I.P. spell Hunter. Crafted the deck just before the nerfs were announced
---
&gt;What are u talking about? The final reveal stream is 3rd and the patch is 4th.
---
streamers they were simply invited to the blizzard headquarters and from there they will stream with all new cards
---
&gt; If they didn't
---
But they did, so there's no point belaboring counterfactuals.
---
Is hearthstone reaching that point where most of the cards are just re-designs of others but in different classes?
---
Woosh. 
---
It actually means "Elemental" /s
---
Yeah, instead of the DK, Hunter us now getting ‚Äúcards that generate more cards‚Äù, but those free cards are fairly costed.  
---
So they don‚Äôt run out of steam like in the pre-DK day‚Äôs, but also just can‚Äôt vomit their hand and go face.
---
Will be nice if they change the way Mind Blast works so that Spellward Jeweler can work against it.
---
Because it's a terrible minion unless it gets to destroy some of your own stuff that takes Mana to make. And even then, it's not particularly strong.
---
Technically yes, but only in decks running 100% Best minions, which might not be the case if some good non-Beast minions get printed.
---
&gt;Guess we are beholding the Troggzor of the expansion
---
Really? Most of people are just saying that it's a solid 1-drop, not calling it crazy good, overpowered or anything. Just good. Which is the case imo.
---
10 am PDT usually. 
---
it also completely screwed the meta in Gadgetzan. the control decks that might have otherwise been able to keep afro shaman and pirate warrior in check just got destroyed by Jade Druid, which was far more popular than it should have been.
---
The hate was warranted.
---
Yeah but it'll be an entirely different zoo deck.
---
That's the joke part of this post
---
Supposedly. It's kind of a paper thin argument that hasn't really been tested, and seems outright suspicious in the greater context. 
---
Come on man....did you really just copy the copy pasta from the reveal post and make it into your own post?
---
Shimmer bois report in.
---
Cool.
---
Nope
---
Nothing is happening today.
---
Ooohh... I really like this card. I'm gonna go ahead and give this a 10/10 right now.
---
Magic: The Gathering has just started to reveal their next expansion, which is this awesome Planeswalker war, and the difference in card design quality is just so stark. I really think that the card design, more than any other single aspect, is what is holding Hearthstone back.
---
You might want to quit if you are getting aneurysm after every rng effect.

After seeing the gameplay discoveries: No, thanks

Hench "Clan Tag"

Insane card. Looks like Chef Nomi made friends with one of the mages of Dalaran.
---
I‚Äôm sure this has been addressed many times, so I apologize for that up front, but as a new F2P player would it be a good idea to dust wild cards after rotation? To keep up with the new standard meta?

Any card?

I hope this wasn't a joke post I crafted Oz'ruk so I could have the other 3

As popular as these rules are, they take away the fun to find actually nice people talking about the game with you. I don‚Äôt follow those rules, so I can tell you: Nice Hearthstone players in fact exist.
---
Looks like good value.

I love it, it's glorious.

This combos nicely with hakkar: replace your bloods with 10 other cards

First day 1 craft of the set so far for me. Really good. I might as well go for golden.
---
This... actually might work
---
The conclusion of this article is legit, but lord what a poorly written piece of coverage.
---
It takes like 5 pages just to get past the exact same stuff that‚Äôs been stated over and over as nauseam on this sub for years, and then the only interesting piece of info they have is from a report that was already released, plus some half assed analysis.
---
Like, this reads like a long Reddit post. I go to Reddit if I want to read a long Reddit post. 
---
It's a quote from the WotLK ending cinematic. Bolvar volunteers to be the new Lich King because otherwise the Scourge would be free to roam uncontrolled. Nothing about the Helm of Domination or Frostmourne really "compels" or ensures that people will find them and become the Lich King.
---
Fun tech card. Make-your-own-Tavern-Brawl!

Holy shit yes

Could be played in a Hakkar deck to get rid of your own corrupted blood

I'm a budget player, tried to build my own version of even shaman today. I have no Lich King, corpsetaker, sea giant etc etc. This is the only value card I've got in even shaman. Turned out to be not bad for me. He can be huge, and most importantly he can destroy totems to make room for other minions. Wondering this card rarely seen play?ü§î
---

I really hope fatigur games will be possible in the new meta to make this playable. Such a coll effect! 
---
Feels very legendary, I love it.
---
This should be the set card back basically.
---
Career-wise he recorded a shabby 442 TDs and 288 INTs for a 1.53 to 1 ratio.. I hope they can achieve more consistency than FAVER.  Sorry, I've been pleading #4 overrated since '95.  I expect this to get downvoted.
---
Thats pretty nice for a fatigue match
---
Well, I found my golden legendary from the bundle
---
That's bananas. 
---
Just when you thought the meta wouldn't have infinite value 
---
She is hot, and that's what truly matters.
---
Yeah but it required 2 turn to make the OTK and ayou also have to kill the 2 galvatron which it sometime not possible. That just my thought but your are also good
---
Hmm can be very fun but there's also a high chance of choosing between gargabe cards...
---
Don't know, I will definitely try it!
---
Now that‚Äôs a fucking Legendary
---
I think this is interesting.  It's very dependent on the Discover pool, but I think there is a potential payoff if the player is able to develop a new game plan on the fly.
---
Or you could just get lucky with a pile of bombs.
---
Oh god oh fuck 
---
An improved version of Hexlord Malacrass!
---
Wow, this is cool as hell. If we end up with a grindy meta then every control deck will run this or they'll just auto loose in fatigue. 
---
Because destroying your board is counter productive. You're better off buffing your totems or evolving them. And in wild we have dranei totemcarver and that doesn't destroy your board. 
---
Ohhhh yeah. I misinterpreted the arrows. Yeah, totally makes sense, thanks!
---
This is great for Control Vs Control I assume ? Getting 10 new cards to counter fatigue is good.

---
True Neutral card
---
Right. Those jokes fly in the circle jerk sub. They don‚Äôt in the parent; at least not nearly as well. 
---
They are skewed because clips don't include new set.
---
Sooo, if I play this when my deck is empty, it fills it with 10 cards, correct? Maybe not bad in a fatigue matchup.
---
Discover = collectible cards that are neutral or from your current class.
---
Very nice, but you really really need to hit some good minions if you want your extra 10 turns to mean anything lol
---

Galvatrons lower the cost of Mecha‚Äôthun to 8, similar to Warlock Mecha‚Äôthun combo. If they refuse to kill the galvatrons your hero power should also be able to make them act with a minion and you can sacrifice them easily

If meta is slow, every control deck runs this or just loses in fatigue surely? 
---
lemme just scrounge up 4 legendary cards real quick 
---
Sounds great for Control matchups. It may add up to 10 cards into your deck. 
---
Probably tech for the fatigue match-up.
---
Anyone else just get a little wet?  Sploosh.
---
Nozdormu would like to have a word with you.
---
You're absolutely right. But I think that this time it is not quite an experiment. According to my data, through surveys, the Boomsday preorder was the most popular among the community. The number of people willing to pre-order was increased by about 10%. This time, the developers want to make as much money as possible **and this is absolutely normal!** But for the same money they reduced the reward... Why?
---
As much as I hate those priest decks, the sass is on point
---
First: amazing art
---
Second: good potential. I can see this being teched for control vs control matchups. Counter Hakkar and fatigue.
---
He is, in 11 hours
---
No he's not a fucking 9 year old
---
Don‚Äôt like this, 8 mana 7/7 no immediate impact, and probably some mediocre cards
---
Actually, I'd say that hunter spells on average are about as powerful for their mana costs than mage spells are, it's the hero power that sets the tone for hunter that causes the spells to appear bad.  
---
That's true too
---
It's so nice having legendaries based on real WoW characters again, RR and this have been so refreshing after Witchwood and especially Boomsday, there was like 1 WoW character in there
---
Oh god.. 
---
It's cool looking but doesn't really have much to do with HS except the slapped-on logo...
---
Having this and Nightmare Amalgam in standard might allow some kind of dual-tribe deck to actually be a thing. 
---
I understand it works like Galvadon, where it Discovers one card, and then proceeds to the next one, after making your choice?
---
Does it add cards if you have less than 10 in your deck?
---
The cards don't matter in fatigue matchups, you play it to get 10 draw advantage on your opponent.  It also lets you be more liberal with your draw effects, which you would often just refuse to play otherwise.
---
Short for "resurrect"
---
if u like my comedy im active on the hearthstonecirclejerk server
---
This is going to get hilarious.
---
Maybe more of a counter card. Against hakkar and against bomb warrior for sure. 
---
That was one key element in my decks, having a new experiance, that is why i used deathrattle to gaine something new each time. Havin archbishop was also fun to get new cards in my deck.
---
I guess silence is back on the menu for this expansion.
---
I don't think surveys are the best way to go about it to get data on pre-orders.  And sometimes you can't compare things like hero portraits. Mecha-Jaraxxus was pretty amazing and created a lot of hype to buy.
---
The reason is this boosts revenue is if the same group of people always order the $50 and $80 package, then they are hoping more people in the $50 group "upgrade" for that golden legendary.  They make more money by encouraging people to spend more for that golden legendary.
---
You either never played with/against fatigue deck or don't understand it's concept and how serious it's damage escalates. If a fatigue deck clears all opponent's threats and survives win condition - the cards which get discivered don't matter - opponent will die, taking 5 damage after only four turns of fatigue. Considering how many combo-disruptive cards were already revelead it's really not a problem to broke OTK decks and eat popcorn while opponent dies from fatigue.
---
No
---
Looks better without the tacked on HS logo which really clashes with the rest of it
---
Going to take your whole turn to pick
---
That's simply untrue, it barely gets played. I maybe play against it once in every 30 games. I'm legend in wild every month. HSreplay also confirms it.
---
this card is a deck filler and won't see play probably for the following reasons:
---
beast decks don't need this cuz there's srsly much better beasts and no luck of good beast cards.
---
dragon decks don't need this cuz when you hold this it's not a dragon.
---
elemental decks don't need this cuz you summon the amalgams, not play them, so it doesn't count towards "if you played last turn".
---
pirate rogue won't use it (assuming it would even exist) cuz it has negative synergy with hooktusk, and if you want to build cannon barrage you got the 2/2 pirate that summons a pirate when you attack which is just that much better for that purpose.
---
aggro decks like hunter or zoo won't use this minion because it's basically a bit worse grim necromancer for them (since they don't care about the type synergy) and since that card didn't ever see play in those decks, neither will this.
---
i highly doubt this will enable any mech deck since they're so far away from viability even considering the magnetic capabilities, since even the upcoming mech hunter seems to go mainly towards deathrattle right now.
---
when trying to predict how will this card be used (and if) we need to compare it to nightmare amalgam which as far as I remember saw play only in dragon decks and dragon/mech hybrids in warrior (though mostly for the dragon synergy there too) cuz it's a cheap good dragon to enable synergy.
---
i don't think the token side matters much, druid can get tokens much more efficiently - if this card did see play it's in either a murloc deck or a somehow new mech decks (though i highly doubt both will use him), good in arena though!
---
This sounds like one of the channels I follow on YouTube.
---
I dusted him accidentally while drunk one night and regret it.
---
Can I earn him back?
---
A good card for following a [[Chef Nomi]] Turn
---
Also nice to have some unsummon in hand (Shadowstep, etc.) to claim another 10 cards later.  Of course, you still need the tools to control the board...
---
Posted above but honestly don't think the randomness is even that bad, the most used case for this card is simply adding 10 cards to an empty deck or to blast away a stacked blood/bomb deck.
---
In a control deck this is going to be the go-to card for control vs control match-ups and then flip them on who got the better discovers for the game.
---
I think the biggest is the card is essentially a dead card until the super late game. There is essentially no reason to ever play this until you are nearly out of your deck. The other might be the cost but to cheap for that effect and it would simply be really OP.
---
I too play "fuck you" warlock!

Sooper value elemental mage.
---
Basically, you run the elemental package except you run thr 2 mana 2 1 deathrattle. Steam surger. Servant of kalimos. Spellstone. Stonehill. And then to top it off leyline manipulator. Throw in a primordial glyph and you will have yourself shooting out 6 mana ptroblasts and 1 mana flamestrikes.
---
Because when Blizz gives a golden legendary they're giving out 1600 dust, which is ~16 (or however many) packs worth of dust, which is (in theory, anyway) 16 fewer packs that you're going to buy because you got enough dust to build all your decks sooner, which is, I dunno, like $20 or so that you're not giving Blizzard. Say, I dunno, 100,000 people buy that particular bundle, so that's $2 million dollars that Blizzard loses by giving you a golden legendary.
---
That's how it all works in Blizzard finance's spreadsheets, at least.
---
But I mean he wasn‚Äôt wrong. Allie is indeed attractive, and I don‚Äôt think he has any bad connotation to it. 
---
He didn‚Äôt make any derogatory remark about her neither. 
---
Wasn‚Äôt like ‚ÄúBah bet Blizzard let her do the reveal solely because she was attractive‚Äù
---
MechCthun? Drop this then discover things you know won't hurt you with killing Ole big boy.
---
This card is probably for control classes only, like a warrior that wants to go to fatigue. Wait until you have no cards left, then play this and add 10 more turns until you make it to fatigue.
---
It's also a tech card against warrior filling your decks with bombs or corrupted blood from another class. It's also just a fun RNG clown fiesta if that's the kind of deck you like to play. It's not a win condition on its own most of the time.
---
I‚Äôve seen lots of zoo decks not run Doomguard. He packs some finishing power but often I see him cost too much resources to end up being effective.
---
True. But he already won the game by playing a 1 mana 2 / 3 into hero power pass so doesn't really matter.
---
I think Warlocks would run something that might give them Jaraxxus, but they won't include Jaraxxus in their decks.
---
Why? What if fatigue decks are T4 this expansion?
---
When the new expansion hits, we won't know what the meta is for at least 1.5 weeks so you should try to hold off on using dust to craft anything (at least epic/legendary) until things settle down.
---
That being said, I think that there's very little harm in disenchanting all commons and rares that are rotating out (cause they are easy to craft again if you REALLY want to use them in wild or in a brawl).  I will also probably disenchant most epics (at least duplicates of them) since they aren't too difficult to craft again.
---
Personally, I will try to avoid disenchanting a lot of legendaries that are rotating out because they are just so iconic/powerful (like any death knight heroes and lich king for example).  A lot of them were so op, that Blizzard will never print "infinite value" cards like them ever again (e.g. Deathstalker rexxar).
---
Great artwork, interesting mechanics, I will definitely want this card for the Haha's.  =)
---
Ah, so in that case your crab/steed idea slots in nicely, especially since a new 2-drop is needed to replace Razormaw.  
---
I'm not saying steed is as good as the ridiculously powerful Razormaw, but it's somethin'. And it's also got that Lynx quality of cleaning the board and feeding hyena.
---
I too play for the Timmy moments
---
He means how can you play Deathknight Uther, the paladin deathknight, as a priest
---
Blizzard: We don't want players to have infinite resources
---
Also Blizzard: **Use Elysiana and two Brewmasters to get an extra 30 cards**
---
Yea when they finally send those cards off, it'll be a glorious day for hearthstone.
---
Dese things happen.
---
So you got free dust?
---
Me too buddy, me too.
---
Isn't this basically shuffle 10 cards into your deck if you have an empty deck? The effect shouldn't be conditional on you having cards in your deck. It replaces the deck, not the cards, correct? If that's the case it would be excellent vs fatigue.
---
This. She‚Äôs waaaay too random to ever work if you‚Äôre looking for answers. She‚Äôs basically just an anti-fatigue card and offers counters to stuff like Hakkar.
---
Well I do not it was spawned by his wandering monster which is that more satisfying
---
Fun &gt; competitiveness
---
How many of your matches go to fatigue in all honesty? Maybe there will be more in this meta but I‚Äôd say right now probably 1 out of 10 games go to fatigue. This card is dead in hand until you reach that point and that‚Äôs a pretty big deal for control decks. Obviously it‚Äôs super helpful in control v control matchups but I think people are vastly overrating this card. It‚Äôs use is extremely niche
---
That shit looks sick as fuck
---
A bug probably relating to the facts that when spectating someone playing against a friend of yours the game can show you both of their hands, and that Malchazar is revealed at the beginning of the game.
---
Keeper Stelladris is at least some consolation for Fandral.
---
If this is homemade, I'm seriously impressed.  Looks like a graphic straight out of a Hearthstone announcement or blogpost (minus maybe the font on the far left column).
---
Yeah, the hag herself not being a beast makes this difficult to justify in hunter since she'd sometimes ruin Master's Call draws.
---
And the nice thing with the Infested Wolf was coining it out and then hitting it with Houndmaster on curve.  Making a 1/1 token into a 3/3 feels less impactful to me if you wanted to try a non-Master's Call hunter.
---
Eventually you will summon the zancient one and succeed 
---
They wont add the "i win vs control" card to their deck when half of this subreddit thinks control/fatigue decks will finally be good again? And what generates jaraxxus anyway? 
---
Except the one time it accidentally did with the 2/1 druid card.
---
But there's nothing forcing you to players this on curve, you can play this when your deck is empty, giving you 10 extra cards. IMHO is awesome against fatigue decks.
---
Odd Warrior is slightly favored vs Big Priest. Super Collider is the MVP here, as are Brawls and Shield Slams. 
---
Shudderwock in wild with this for the game that never ends.
---
AND bomb warrior counter.
---
Well shudderwocks setup involves playing cards that help you survive starting as early as turn 4. 
---
This combo requires going a bit more off the beaten path
---
I think the fact that it‚Äôs a deathrattle and not a battlecry that makes this worse than the book
---

A compact method of generating multiple pirates for Cannon Barrage synergy is where my head goes first.  But I feel like we're missing some remaining piece of the puzzle yet on this.  
---
Why is she 350% healthier and stronger than Khadgar?
---
With the exception of rush wareior, all the decks left are going to look vastly different. I think you are underestimating the importance of a couple cards to a deck's viability, and the meta that they sit in. Sure, some form of master's call hunter may exist, but without rexxar, dire mole, crackling, flanking, it'll look vastly different. Rogue losing strider is huge. Depending on what other decks arise, these decks may not stick around.
---
What I'm trying to say is that this isn't a very useful list. We all know how impactful  2017 was.
---
Yeah Dr Boom, I love that fuse thing as well
---
Pls stop :]

thank you!

Yeah, they should make the discovered cards follow the bucket rules.

Fuck Wild Togwaggle!

Yes, excellent against Fatigue... Until Fatigue plays their copy.
---
&gt; How many of your matches go to fatigue in all honesty?
---
There are no fatigue decks right now what you are talking about? You can't just compare regular decks goint into fatigue and deck which is built specificly around that in mind and has all the AOEs, heals and removals to outlive anything. 
---
They realized how broken one drops are so they had to cut the power level 
---
Thanks mate!

I totally agree that Blizzard should at least consider something like this. But let's see what they' ve planned.

Finally, the Darkness counter we all needed.

They managed to make Explore Un'Goro but worse

Why is everything from this set include a fucking "random" mechanic?

How do you do it in wild?
---
I have finally found a use for my real analysis skills
---
Prep -&gt; Coin -&gt; Concede
---
Yea thought at least this one has a unique spin on it unlike most other ones.
---
Taking that long with it meant you weren't really thinking about what you'd do ahead of time.
---
And on top of that, you usually weren't even casting the spell the same turn, so might as well take your time.
---
This is literally replacing your entire deck, not just adding a bonus spell to your hand with a few effects.
---
I‚Äôve been playing quest paladin and it actually isn‚Äôt too bad. certainly not a high tier deck but I‚Äôve been able to beat midrange hunters and wall priests alike
---
This is going in my Priest Eggs deck (a deck that removes all of its cards 3 cost or under, then steals the opponent's deck and uses Shadowreaper Anduin as a finisher).
---
wat
---
Hear that? Ancient Shade is now viable!
---
*Howdy* 
---
Shuffle effects existed in arena during the Caverns of Times events and permanently shuffling cards into your deck that were in your hand temporarily DID work, so this interaction should work. 
---
No joke, but try wild odd Druid. It's super memey but I used it to push 18-14 at season reset yesterday. 
---
Fatigue warrior likes this card a lot
---
If Undatakah picks up three Lucentbarks, he will go dormant once. Just like with Immortal Prelate, it moves that specific card to either your deck or goes dormant. When Immortal Prelate gets double **Deathrattle** from Baron Rivendare, it doesn't shuffle in extra copies because that specific card is shuffling into your deck.
---
This set looks HORRIBLE. Imagine spending real money on this. I had an open mind given the Hall of Fame but this is so bad. 
---
Brode left a sinking ship. Clearly. Given revenue is down 52%, people should vote with their dollars and make Blizzard really hurt. This will never get better until 100% of people stop buying it. 
---
Stratholme alone had a confirmed number of 25000 residents and all but a handful were raised so it's quite more than a couple thousand even with all the Scourge that have been permanently killed. We barely scratched the surface with multiple fronts of magic and technology. 
---
Yeah I remember how big a deal the first Elise was just to stave off fatigue for another turn
---
Hard to tell because people will use the paladin card duel or the hecklebot to try and pull it. but if that happens then people will just stuff their decks with mega minions, going to take a while to see when meta will settle down.
---
card dump is usually after final reveal stream?
---
They doubled class legendaries the same time they stopped making as many neutral legendaries. Went from 10-12 or so neutrals per set to 5 or 6. 
---
At least the math is correctly done by AI
---
Can you discover the same card? Like get a deck 10 mind blasts because you were offered it all 5 times?
---
This actually started out as "**Battlecry:** Draft a new deck." But it turns out that takes a long time. :)
---
I was so close to crafting [[Hemet, Jungle Hunter]] for my Hakkar Priest. The new neutral seems so much better and fits in even more decks, AND will be in standard for the next two years. Sweet!

2/-/- | Replace your deck with copies of "Discover a card."

Twinspell is also great for hunter specifically because of the value with zul'jin. It not only casts both copies, but you'll get the non twinspell version of the spell when zul'jin casts the twinspell version
---
Similar popularity. Buckets are based on pick rate, not win rate
---
We're going to ease into Specialist with the preconstructed deck. We're trying 3 class specialist, Bo3 with the provided constructed decks. So you'll have one class that is your primary that you'll need to start with then you can switch to the others game 2/3.
---
Oooooh so you‚Äôre a *BITCH* .
---
i think its more to extend fatigue for 10 extra turns.
---
Blizz making fun and interesting card, and what does this sub do...nothing but complain.
---
Mmmm that Menagerie Magician synergy
---
the thing is that when you fail to remove even 1 minion they kills you the next turn
---
This card is just insane and got me to pull the preorder trigger. Every deck will be a fatigue deck. Shudderwhock, shadowstep, seance, etc. I don‚Äôt see myself ever not putting this in a deck. 
---
My prediction:
---
Neutral Legendary Dragon
---
Big body (8/8; 10/10; 12/12)
---
Strong effect (ex. Lich King; Nzoth; Keleseth)
---
you should get 15 free Rastakhan packs - the gift for returning players
---
Ik right! I really wanted to play it, but thats only in the shaman class  :(
---
I will not open them because it killed the hype and opening a lot more packs on release is more fun. I couldnt play with the cards because I simply created a tavern for me only
---
It actually should be the same time as galvadon
---
yes
---
You say armor is oppressive, but you want healing to function the same exact way armor does
---
I can't believe the fucking idiots in this subreddit that downvote anything remotely negative.
---
neutral
---
How stressful would that be, one wrong cut and goodbye hours and hours of work.
---
I can't recommend dusting anything you don't have extra copies of. Even less so when you're new
---
Also, try searching for 'extra'. It will show any cards where you have more than you need when normal and golden versions are both considered. Then just dust the extra golden ones
---
I wouldn't just call her better. She's a *lot* harder to play than Elise. Elise you can just plop down for 5 whenever. With this, you have to make a decision about when to play her, and if you draw her too early, you might be holding a dead card for awhile. Even when you're finally ready to play her, you need to commit 8 Mana to a card that has zero immediate board impact.
---
That's why I like about this one: it encourages decision making. We haven't had enough of that in the game during the last year. 
---
Love this one, I'm thinking about crafting it gold
---
Seems interesting, but not oppressively powerful...although I can‚Äôt think of a deck for it. Something Midrange that runs a lot of Battlecry minions seems like it might work though. Are we back to the days of Midrange Shaman?
---
the wild pastures will already do it.
---
No. If you heal yourself at 30 you're still at 30. Armor it was easy to get like 80 - 100 health. I just want healing effects to go off even if you're at Max health 
---
You heard him guys!
---
C'THUN SYNERGY!
---
Oh. If that‚Äôs the case then disregard everything I said.
---
Well to be fair it wouldn't be EXACTLY the same, since Alextraza would be able to undo it. Still, terrible idea, lol.
---
Day 1 craft for me. 
---
Comboing this with Splitting Image would be pretty funny.
---
Getting a 'free' 1/4 taunt isn't bad, it's just a bad card to put in your deck

1. People like winning. Big priest wins, even though it's not the best deck
---
2. Fun decks are very expensive, and I don't believe there's a lot of folks who can actually afford to play multiple different fun decks

3. Fuck big priest
---
rogue is already cancer in wild

Vargoth is a better Cannon Barrage synergy for 10 mana than this.

---
Millhouse on 2 against priest has actually won me a few games as well :)  
---
I'm pretty sure both shaman and rogue will be able to put together a decent aggro deck. Current aggro shaman loses firefly (and theres a new 1 drop for them anyway) and we still have hench clan and the pirate synergies for rogue.
---
R.I.P Fatigue.. 
---
Whats with the fire crown thing
---
Okay, so you want healing to active card effects, but not actually heal? Interesting idea, but it would make some cards obscenely powerful. Northshire Cleric comes to mind
---
I love playing wild Jade Shaman.  It‚Äôs tier 3 at best, but I love it.  Day 1 craft for me.  
---
Why conceal the barnes?
---
I don't think this is good, but I just want to commend HS devs for making interesting neutral cards. 
---
In the past, this would've been a 5/8 neutral minion with no text.
---
Lol no it's not, 5 Mana do nothing the turn it comes down. No thanks.
---
All looks fun, but we have been looking forward to expansions before. Then we get smacked in our faces by hyaenas, Huffers and Patches and all the fun and value goes down the drain. Notably we have only seen one AOE card so far. 
---
Warlock has had both of it's legendaries revealed though, so I definitely think it will be Warrior over Warlock. Warlock and Priest are dark-horses, though. Perhaps they will be the opponent's decks. 
---
Thats really upsetting actually because i dont think shaman has the sustain to play control after losing healing rain and volcano. I kniw hagathas schene is supposed to be the new board clear but it needs to ramp and unlike druid shaman cant just do nothing for 4 turns and come out ok.
---
I wrote a clarification. I don't want health to go over 30. Just healing effects such as get a random spell after healing to go off if you use health on a Max health target. You would essentially waste the heal for tempo. 
---
Silverback Patriarch has been a Hall of Fame candidate since the first rotation and frankly I‚Äôm amazed it‚Äôs made it this far. 3 Mana for 1/4 stats **AND** Taunt is ridiculously good and it‚Äôs definitely not something *tar creep* - sorry, *to sleep* on. 
---
She‚Äôs mounting something alright
---
Really depends on the wincon of each decks. Benedictus isn't necessarily an auto win in control vs control and he is better than this card in that set up. And it's a neutral card so any control deck can run it, meaning it's a meta and decklist issue, not one of polarization.
---
These fatigue grinds haven't really been here since Wotog was released. And since Warriors have boom while other classes lose their DK I doubt we'll go back there.
---
Well played.
---
I concede.
---
A mammoth tusk. They're one of the epic mounts that you can buy in Dalaran I believe.
---
Kapp
---
It seems like there might be some obscure OTK with this card in the future
---
That's a fair point. Maybe a simple rewrite of Northshires text? Healing a damaged minion draw a card? 
---
Or more if he casts Vanish. Then you throw a Shudderwok, and you can keep this going for a while.
---
So were you completely making up your facts last week, or completely making facts this week?  Because if you haven't played in a month, one of those two must be true.
---
Reno Jackson, Kazakus, Zola, Banker, Malacrass, Dirty Rat, Gluttonous Ooze, Nzoth, Keysmith, so many juicy targets for this in my Reno decks.
---
Disenchant and craft barista. 
---
It's usually this much. Most of the random neutrals aren't revealed on stream and also most of them are just unmemorable pack filler.
---
Just play two weaponized pinatas and always find prince liam
---
What you don‚Äôt like the decisions in Mecha‚Äôthun Druid of ‚Äúdraw cards or gain armor?‚Äù 
---
Contrary to popular belief, wild is cheaper than standard. So for a f2p player, dusting wild legendaries is just stupid. Instead, they should start shaping their collection based on what has consistenly worked in wild
---
What's the flavor ? (besides coffee)
---
 EU Edderion#2722 80g you go first 
---
Thank god Silverback Patriarch is a best.
---
Well first off, correct me if I'm wrong, but they're not actually changing any of the existing burgle cards for rogue, the new one(s) that they're adding just have a different version of the mechanic. 
---
Secondly, healing is just that, healing. Over-heal would be incredibly counter-intuitive, unless you're exactly a quake player transitioning to hearthstone. 
---
\&gt;This will cause players to have to play self damage cards in order to have lost the health to activate heal synergies. 
---
Yes. This is how deck-building synergies work. It's also why weapons/minions that damage your own hero generally come over-statted.
---
Worst art in the set

stop pretending shaman is bad
---
I‚Äôm definitely gonna be playing it in an aggro/tempo list with vex crow and sorc apprentice. I think it‚Äôs flexible enough to be used in aggro or control
---
8 mana 7/7 delay fatigue by 20 turns.
---
Thank you blizzard.
---
How so?
---
One for each class. 
---
- Karazhan Midrange Druid (variations of which included everything from ramp to C'Thun to spell)
---
- Yogg n' Load Hunter
---
- Reno Grinder Mage
---
- GvG Midrange Paladin
---
- Raza Priest
---
- Rogue, my favorite class... It's a toss-up between Classic Miracle and Kingsbane Mill. Thief Rogue is close as well. 
---
- Crusher Shaman
---
- Handlock/Renolock
---
- LoE Control Warrior
---
It isnt necessarily a control card. It fits into the "wallet warrior" archetype that sort of floated around standard with the recruit weapon and cards some days back. The big mana cheats from that deck make surviving to the 10 mana turns possible. Also, and this is important, warrior has cheap removal spells that can help it to its "shadow essence" turns.
---
The entire deck is large, with reasonable mana cheats. It may be closer to big rogue than big priest, it isn't huge power swing turns, but rather repititve abuse from huge minions, from turn 6 on, big warrior should be consistently able to fire out giant statlines that NEED to be dealt with.
---
Big warrior never really saw the light of day. One thing is certain though, when it got its footing, it was one of the most punishing decklists to be matched up against. 
---
So  **Barista Lynchen**  was just revealed, which can copy Chef Nomi plus 8 other minions in the deck. So it makes sense to cut Power of Creation for that. 
---
Absolutely. That‚Äôs what really sets this apart for me. I think this‚Äôll see a lot of play. 
---
If this card is poop you can call me shitdeck mcdoodoo.
---
it depens i mean my paladin is 45 but i only have 130 wins with it so...
---
seems like someone hasn't played bp vs kingsbane or a lot of aggro decks before it's not free wins lol. the deck is mod tier 2 for a reason...
---
Neutral has 5 legendaries revealed. There has been 5 neutral legs since they started with double class legs. 
---
Filler
---
The original vendor is [Mei Francis](https://imgur.com/a/r4m170o)  sad to see her drawn so poorly and as a generic character when she was so iconic during wrath of the lich king
---
If that is not one sexy F helmet, I don't know what is!
---
Overall a pretty boring card
---
Looks like about a 50/50 of getting something decent. Having said that, you wouldn't even put this into any kind of deck unless you thought you could get a few spells off, so although I doubt it will see any play outside of arena, it would be like a super violet teacher for rogue.

You mean \[\[Preparation\]\]X2 into \[\[Coin\]\]X2
---
lol spreading the stats over two bodies in that way is really bad.
---
Add a copy of your other _**Battlecry** minions_ Shudderwocks to your hand
---
YOU CAN STILL PLAY BAKU MAGE IN STANDARD 
---
Thanks a ton! I agree with MOARCookies, it'd be nice if they actually made that clear on the Fireside Gatherings page.
---
What kind of spaghetti code does it take to be incapable of counting to 30?
---
Unless the meta becomes this and everyone just plays mechathun just in case they face it. I mean it‚Äôs possible. 
---
she deserves it, was WAY more well known/iconic than half of the legendaries printed in this game
---
Meat Wagon's rotating out, too.
---
Yea youre not putting that card in Big Priest, also thats an 11 mana combo
---
Lol, don‚Äôt underestimate the rage of random Redditors. 
---
Every control deck might end up using this card and then people will start using mechathun and then this deck will include both. 
---
Oddly, the evidence argues for the exact opposite.  By the revenue data, 2017 was the most profitable year for HS.  The first year without adventures and before any of the improvements to the economy were made.  That's before they increased the gold/quest, made quests easier to complete, added in no-dupe legendary protection.  Also before they added 22 packs into the new player experience.  Before they started doing things like bonus gold and dust for quests events.
---
As they've reduced the cost for the game, it's generated less revenue... shocking!
---
Easily among my favorite Hearthstone cards. 
---
Varian helps fatigue along, this guy doesn't.
---
usually done by playing shudderwock from your hand.

Kalecgos is the strongest reveal lorewise.
---
I think this is a 4/5. It has acceptable stats, puts a second body into play, can likely impact an opponent's board (unless you're running trash minions in your warrior deck), and can be found off of other mech discovery options. I wish that they had made it only pull out mechs, but I think it would have been just insane if they'd done that.
---
*I serve the firelord!*
---
or like some have  theorized he is outside the set ,kinda like marin. Since golden is from adventure and normal cant be from pack just crafted;
---
It's a "go big" card. The random elements are one of the cool gimmicky things a digital ccg has over physical ccgs. Not saying it's good or bad.
---
That‚Äôs why I ask. Maybe it‚Äôs a new classic card. We‚Äôve seen many classic cards be added since the HoF, maybe they heard us wanting Whizbang in classic. Wishful thinking 
---
wow didn't know you are into necrophilia , i'm glad you love to make out with Frost Lich Jaina, most people prefer Valeera the Hollow ([Thicc](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/shacknews/assets/editorial/2017/08/Valeera_the_Hollow_Art.jpg))  or Bloodreaver Guldan ( [Ripped body](https://i.imgur.com/9128OdL.jpg) )
---
Barnes 2
---
If I was using boomship I probably wouldn‚Äôt have too many important battlecries. But I understand the literal difference I‚Äôm just trying to relate it to something we have. 
---
So they only have one Legendary left to reveal? That stream is going to be really boring...
---
Well it is a card for the warrior class, costing 10 mana, that summons a copy of a minion from your deck while also giving it rush. I believe that's what they were going for 
---
Still got the rope during those 5 picks.
---
I mean, if dice rolling is your thing then that's totally fine but the moment people start claiming there's immense skill to Hearthstone, you lose me.
---
Source?
---
It also gives a way what youre doing before youre doing it (assuming that people wont know if all youre doing is drawing a lot)
---
Just wondering, why exactly did you craft Malchezaar?
---
He got you there mate.
---
Probably different people. Also, there's a fine line between pushing and forcing archetypes. New expansions should push new or existing archetypes, but they should still allow the class to do other things.
---
F R E  E Z E - M A G E
---
I'd say Shaman is looking great too, even with the few cards they were given, they have those big control tools and can cheat out big minions effect with Muckmorpher.
---
Rogue is also getting some seriously good value cards, so I wouldn't be surprised if they get a good spot in the meta.
---
this doesn't swap your hand, it just changes your deck. Wayy too slow to be run in aggro, you don't know what you're talking about lol
---
Good thing we have a very valuable hof coming
---
It has been established in lore that Hagatha didn't make the Nighmare Amalgam, it was an experiment from Boom Labs that managed to escape and found its way to the forest near Gilneas. With that in mind it looks like Dr. Boom shared the secrets of making amalgams with Hagatha's forces to better their arsenal (as seen through Hench-Clan Hag). 
---
This really helps show a sense of teamwork between the members of EVIL. They aren't just doing their own things here in Dalaran, they're playing off of each other as team mates should.   
---
Nothing better than losing the game on turn 2 when a firefly triggers your wandering howl fiend. 
---
You shuffle in an extra copy of each card in your hand. You draw the number of cards you had in your hand.
---
Looks really strong actually, those are some really consistently strong options, only bad one being the owl. Even Raven and Silverback is pretty decent value 
---
I‚Äôm putting the scheme in any slow warrior decks. Not because it‚Äôs good, but because I want to surprise people when we‚Äôre both close to fatigue death and I come out with 2 25 armor cards
---
Probably not good to put into your actual deck but a pretty good discover from assembly or boom hero power
---
##Getting Started To Hearthstone Tips
---
1.  First, all this information and more can be found in the [Reddit Beginners Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6tbyp5/hearthstone_beginners_guide_year_of_the_mammoth/).
---
2. The best way to get gold is just finishing Daily Quests. (Always re-roll 50g quests)
---
3.  Get all the classes to Level 10 and beat all the Expert AI bosses.  Jump into Ranked as soon as possible (Casual mode is locked until you are Rank 25.)  Don't worry, Ranks 50-26 is a one time climb.
---
4. Also, get one class to Level 20 to unlock Tavern Brawls which get you 1 free Classic pack per week. (Wed-Sun)
---
5. Complete the Prologue in Knights of the Frozen Throne for a free Death Knight.  Death Knights are *very* impactful.
---
6. There are also special promotions still active that get you free packs in the game.  You can even use an emulator to knock them all out quickly. (*Use Google*). (Play a game on iPad, iPhone, Android Tablet, Android Phone, and Samsung Galaxy phones)
---
7.  Open packs in each set until you unlock a Legendary.  In your first 10 packs of a set you are guaranteed a legendary whereas the normal drop rate is 1/20.  I would start with Knights of the Frozen Throne in hopes of getting another Death Knight.  Or start with a pack released in 2018 (Witchwood, Boomsday, or Rastakahn).  
---
8.  You can also complete all 3 Wings of *Knights of the Frozen Throne*.  In total, this rewards you with 1 Legendary Death Knight (Prologue), 3 Packs, and special Paladin Portrait.  (F2P Guides courtesy of TommyJTheGamer)
---
  * [First Wing of Ice Crown Citadel](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6sydke/im_the_guy_who_did_the_mostly_free_to_playbasic/)
---
  * [Second Wing of Ice Crown Citadel](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6uf7g5/im_the_guy_who_did_the_basicfree_to_play/)
---
  * [Final Wing, and hardest, of Ice Crown Citadel] (https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6w4koa/im_the_guy_who_did_the_basicfree_to_play/).
---
9.  If you buy 1x Kobolds and Katacombs pack you will get a free Legendary, Marin the Fox.  It isn't competitive, you can't disenchant it, but it is free.
---
10. Aim to get 5 Ranked wins each month for the free cardback and rewards.  The best rewards are at 20,15,10, and 5 so these ranks are important.  (Compared to Rank 5, Legend is only +45 dust)
---
11.  Buying in bulk is usually best.  If in doubt, focus on Classic (will always be good in Standard) and sets released in the current year.  Right now that is The Witchwood, The Boomsday Project, and Rastakahn's Rumble.
---
12. You only get cardbacks but if you want help on the solo player content you can find it here:  [Kobolds and Catacombs Dungeon Run](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/7qtrt9/noblords_guide_to_dungeon_runs/), [The Witchwood Monster Hunt](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/8ff4wy/monster_hunt_overview_and_monster_hunter_guides/), [The Boomsday Puzzle Labs](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/guides/puzzle-lab-guide-release-date-experiments-card-back/) or the [Rastakahn Rumble Run](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/a8ddw7/guide_to_rumble_run/).
---
13. If you play Arena, you can get drafting help with [HearthArena](http://www.heartharena.com/) or [Lightforge](http://thelightforge.com/tierlist).  You can also find the ["Rewards Table"](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Arena#Table) here.

Die Barista, Die
---
If this pulls anything medium to large, you'll probably win the game on the spot. If you're ahead on board, you'll stay ahead, if you're even, you'll probably win the trade(s), and if you're behind and not immediately dead, you'll probably mount a comeback. So much synergy with this card and the fact it summons a copy is tremendous. I think most warrior control decks will find use of this. 
---
Yo dawg
---
Thanks!
---
My jaws that bite my claws that catch
---
People have done a good job of answering your second question about getting more packs.
---
Your first question is harder to answer. "What should [your] priorities be?"
---
It sort of depends on what you want to do with the game. If your goal is to expand your collection as much as possible, you should make the cheapest tier 1 deck every expansion (people have been right to point out you should wait a couple weeks to let things settle) and reach rank 5 with it each month. This will take some time your first climb but it is helpful to remember that you can make it to rank 5 with only a 50% overall winrate. It will take you about 180 games (~6 a day), but you will eventually get there. Doing this will net you an extra ~2000 dust each expansion, which is huge for building your collection.
---
If you want to reach Legend, then same as above, but you need to play more games. You also need a positive winrate, so you may need to grow as a player.
---
Something I don't see a lot of people talking about is how winrate isn't the only or even most important factor when it comes to whether you should craft a deck/card. Winning is fun, but most players are under rank 15, even after playing for a while, and they're still having a good time. As a F2P player, you will often have to choose between cool/fun and powerful decks. If the former is more your speed, I recommend watching a lot of streamers and taking note of the decks that appeal to you. If you can't afford the entire deck that strikes your fancy, recognize that decks are made of packages - sets of cards that work together. You can pick out a cheaper package from an expensive deck and play with that. For example, Deathrattle Hunter plays a lot of expensive legendaries - King Crush, Kathrena, Rexxar, Keleseth, Zilliax, Houndmaster Shaw, sometimes Oondasta; but you can still have a lot of fun with the main deathrattle package:
---
Cube x2
---
Devilsaur Egg x2
---
Terrorscale Stalker x2
---
Play Dead x2
---
Spider bomb x2
---
These 10 cards are only 1460 dust. Whatever you use to fill the legendary vacuum will not perform as well, but you can still have a lot of fun. If you choose packages that will be in the game for awhile, then you can increase the power level of your deck that runs that package over time as you collect more cards. This way you can dip your toes into several archetypes at once. This is NOT an efficient way to build full decks, and "full decks" are the most powerful. But it will let you have several decks that are fun to play at lower ranks as a F2P player.
---
When I first started, I spent all my new expansion dust on a single deck and got burnt out grinding it. The next couple expansions, I did more of the second route and slowly built several decks. It took me much longer to reach Rank 5 than is possible for a new player, but I enjoyed the experience more.
---
tl;dr: if you want to hit Legend/collect as many cards as possible, craft the cheapest top tier deck each expansion and play it a lot. Otherwise, don't worry about what is "best" and just watch other people play and craft the packages you like.
---
You're the one saying it gets wins. I'm saying it's easy to play and frustrating. I know it's tier 2.
---
This card will never be good in aggro. If I am on turn 8 in aggro and my best play is war golem, then the chances of winning that game is pretty low and since aggro usually doesn't draw many cards, a card that is useless most of the time is a big deal.
---
If you're playing Aggro and haven't finished the game by turn 9 I've got some bad news for you....
---
This is not a strong argument, considering there's male streamers as stated above like Dog who go through this. If its a genuine nice comment like "wow she's very pretty" then its fine, but predatory comments like "damn hot babe lemme smash" then it is obviously wrong. Plus, just an FYI a lot of these creeps is how women in Twitch so don't be surprised female streamers are generalized as sluts that will take any comment as long as they make money
---
You can't even get Zayle in packs. You have to craft him and can only craft his normal version.
---
Adding nearly nothing new to the game and still wanting 50 bucks suck it
---
I guess but like past turn 5 u can never get anything down: blizzard,flamestrike,meteor, dragon fury
---
Shudderwock? (Sp)
---
Well that's what the Brann's for 
---
duuuude. I cannot wait to put this in my dragon priest deck...wowsers. 
---
Okay, yeah that thing is trash. I'm with the masses in thinking it *must* have been an 11th-hour change from something bomb-related.
---
I'd tap that.
---
The spellstone ressurects Vargoth, you don't play him on the same turn. And some wild Big Priests run Thaurissan
---
If you have evil miscreant would you make room for togwaggle?
---
Thats why its fun right. Its fine if its confusing one day on aprils fools
---
I double checked, the listed rewards include 15 ROS packs, a gold classic pack, 2 card backs and the Zayle, Shadow Cloak legendary.  Zayle is supposed to be like Whizbang and give you one of 5 premade decks matching the 5 antagonists.  I think they did confirm that it's not disenchantable.
---
Also you get all the single player content, the new hero powers, starting decks, enemies etc.
---
I still really want Toki to be added to Classic.  ~~Even if its at the loss of Antonidas~~
---
No, the spellstone ressurects Vargoth, you don't have to play him the same turn.
---
No it gets super rush
---
http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=74324 
---
&gt; This may attack the turn before you cast it. (You may put this card from your hand onto the battlefield tapped and attacking during your declare attackers step. If you do, you lose the game at the beginning of your next turn's end step unless you pay this card's mana cost during that turn.)
---
Yea, she did a great job on Happy Hearthstone! It was fun to listen to her and Peter, she gave some really cool design insights on old and upcoming cards, and was one of the folks behind the Death Knights as we know now (plus she wrote the quote HOW LONG CAN THIS GO ON).
---
What if it was a 4 mana 7/7 that looked like a gorilla..? 
---
I think its safe to assume that the vast majority of players rejoice at the fact that those two are gone for good.
---
On the 5th if you can get to a pre-release event. I think you can host a private one at home, but you'll have to check.
---
https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/hearthstone/22933273/the-rise-of-shadows-pre-release-looms-over-dalaran
---
April 5th during Pre-Release fireside gatherings.
---
Well that's just expensive in a completely different way. :P
---
If you Soularium with Vargoth, at the end of your turn he will draw you three cards that will Discard at the end of your next turn.
---
If you have Betrug on the board and he summons Vargoth, Vargoth will get to trigger before he dies at the end of the turn.
---
Yep, this has witchwood raven all over it 
---
Not sure I'd call it a dream to fill my board with Ironbeak Owls and Silverback Patriarchs.
---
When it comes out like everyone else. Pre-ordering is just paying before hand.
---
I just dont see it working out well with all the new tools this expansion. Hecklebot and the one that makes you cast a spell from your hand can both be instant losses
---
KnC had 5 neutral legendaries including Marin, as usuallly.
---
As the others said, Zayle will probably just be outside of the expansion.
---
Your deck is better than mine! Nerf that shit! Lol
---
Man, you are playing Aggro and complaining about your turn 9?
---
They will become a problem in Wild in the next 1-2 years without constant pruning/nerfs like Cold Blood and Flametongue. I'm keeping my Golden Copies in anticipation.
---
I agree. We should just all riot and not play the next expansion at all. How dare they give us an extra free legendary a few days before the expansion!!!
---
Yes.
---
Battlecry: summon a copy of a minion in your deck. Give it Rush.
---
That doesn't cost 3
---
He is the sleeper hit of the expansion.
---
&gt;when the draw is right
---
It gets a successful combo draw about 90% of games, by Turn 6.
---
Turn 6 combo is STILL a massive problem. You have to be hyper aggro or need a bounce or transform spell to beat that. Most classes dont have that shit or need to tech hard for it.
---
&gt; Shadow Essence a Barnes
---
In fewer than 10% of games this happens. It's also not even world ending, it's a bit of a boost to the opponent if they arent hard teching. 
---
&gt; it rly has to pay for it by being horrible at it's lowest
---
I could live with that if the deck was inconsistent. It isn't. It has a dozen boardwipes, a ton of ways to stall out, and the draw is *still* consistent anyways!
---
&gt; highroll-dependant
---
I hate this terminology, since it's the same as rolling a 3 on a D20. Was that a highroll? Well, in terms of Res Priest it is. Its "highroll" just means you *cant* win against it. A "midroll" means if you didn't hand-hate or aggro him down already, you cant win. A lowroll happens very rarely, less than 1 in 10 games on average. This consists of them either not drawing any of their combo pieces by Turn 8 or getting one and pulling Barnes. Spoiler Alert, even if this happens, they have boardwipes to keep digging until they can try to roll again. The deck isn't a "highrolly" deck just because it employs cards that roll and a one off legendary that wins you the game if you throw it down on four. The deck is consistent because it can do *all of that*. A deck that summons the Ancient One on Turn 5 by bouncing and replaying Barnes? That is a highrolly deck. A deck that automatically wins 20% of its games through Barnes and also has a backup res package that lets it win over half of the other games? That is a consistent deck that occasionally lowrolls.
---
Kingsbane with Lifesteal was cancer because of its consistency and its ability to shut down decks entirely. Even Shaman was very powerful but was far from cancer. It gave you every opportunity to fight it. Consistent small board presence, high pressure board wipes, direct face spells, all of these can be played around and against. Early game plays VS Priest often mean fuckall when it coins Lightbomb, then Psychic Screams your board or Spirit Lashes your early game minions or Shadow Word Deaths your value minion you're using to push lethal or throws down the Hero to wipe your board of big buffed minions.
---
So much wiping, so much consistency, low odds for lowroll, and if he nidrolls, he wins. If he lowrolls but has enough removal to stall, he probably still wins. **THE LICH KING** is one of the weaker cards in the deck. Can you believe that?

Bit late.

Nah just print it
---
But if he multiplied first?
---
Oooooh that's much more balanced than what I thought. I was thinking a Warmaster Voone but for battlecries *in your hand* not on the board.
---
zurg rush?
---
No not specifically aggro i was just saying the card allows the user to survive forever
---
In a value/control oriented meta, fatigue matters a lot. Saying fatigue is irrelevant is making the assumption the meta doesn‚Äôt go into fatigue. In a control vs control matchup, the fatigue is generally what ends the game, which makes the relevancy of this card not fatiguing you vs what Varian Wrynn did very important. Varian was terrible in control vs control, this card is not. I‚Äôm not saying this card is strong, I think it‚Äôs a fair card, which in most cases isn‚Äôt good enough for competitive, but to say fatigue is irrelevant is a bit too much. 
---
Well, obviously, that's not an argument anybody is making. 
---
I got it by mail with this text :

&gt;and was one of the folks behind the Death Knights as we know now (plus she wrote the quote HOW LONG CAN THIS GO ON).
---
When was this revealed? Must have missed it
---
As far as i watched Thijs revealing this card. You discover 3 cards each for 5 times. And you gotta choose 1 card each of those 5 discovers. And of course as card says it copies twice each of your chhose, so 10 cards in total.Also those cards replacing your existing deck as mentioned. 
---
I've done that for the last two rotations and have never regretted it.  I don't care about tavern brawls or wild though.  That's really all it comes down to.
---
How dare they increase the size of an expansion. Such monsters.
---
I think for Baku yes, but a few people dont seem to bothered by Genn. But Baku definitely overpowered, as much as I'll miss him
---
Turn 10 : omega agent + Barista for some nice value
---
I've never played wild but I intend to now that baku will be there 
---

Hench-Clan Hag, Mimiron's, Conceal. Hmmmmm.
---
You're getting downvoted because you forgot to say "I know I'm about to get downvoted but..."
---
this was one of my favorite cards until odd paladin came about
---
then it turned into a random win condition and thats lame
---
This is better than the other 10 drop, only because this essentially gets you two minions that actually impact the board when you play it (this is if you've played Dr Boom Hero).
---
I just don't know how I feel about this "summon" warrior. Recruit was really op, but in warrior it never took off. Also I don't want it to take off lol. Again, recruit was arguably a terrible mechanic.
---
Still the same problem as the other warrior card, what minions do you now run to make this work? 
---
They should have been in last set of year then they would leave in peace. 
---
The average board state is a minion on both sides. If aggro is running over you on turn 6 so bad that you can't stick a minion, even after you killed something with flame ele, then that isn't average. 
---
Also, look at the direction of the game and tell me what aggro deck there is that will smash you that fast. Unless some miracle, op aggro cards are printed, I'm not seeing the average aggro time to kill being less than turn 8. Its about to be a value meta with value midrange and control decks at the top. This card fits very well in that context.
---
Perfect with Hunter's mark
---
Obviously with emperor ticks to play on the same turn.
---
Not per se spagathi code.  It probably has twe conditions: one for to many cards and one for to few cards. For some reason both got triggered and put there output in the notifcation
---
In WoW, Basilisks are pretty large, so [[Stoneskin Basilisk]] definitely qualifies. Additionally, Dreadscale was an enormous worm-monster.
---
Thank you yes that‚Äôs exactly it it was arena and i did pick the second one haha sorry if it was confusing 
---
Makes so much sense...
---
Just coming to add another voice to confirm this fix.

The second botao pair created by vargoth wont trigger their end of turn effect
---
pretty much all karma grubbing infographics on this sub are wrong and have an asterisk somewhere in the first post, it's okay brah.
---
Ahh, the patriarch.
---
He attac
---
He protec
---
But most importantly
---
He has beast tag
---
Hmm... As a gorilla he does become something of a soft taunt... I mean... who wouldn‚Äôt throw everything they have at the Gorilla? It‚Äôs just so imposing. I‚Äôm on the fence.
---
First off: The deathrattles need to happen in the right order. The Undatakah needs to go dormant first, THEN restore health to be re-awakened. Not the other way around. So this is a 50/50.
---
Next, he'd come back as a plain Lucentbark without the Doctor's deathrattle. So this wouldn't cause any kind of infinite cycle.

Remember that the genn boost is only on your starting hero power, so you'll still have a 2 mana void form
---
"... to craft at least two legendaries that becomes meta." Here. I fixed it for you. 
---
Aw it's a shame King togwaggle is rotating out. I guess I'll have to meme in wild. 
---
Vilespine isn't a core card in Myracle, losing Striders is big but ultimately it's just 2 cards.  The draw engine is still there, so the deck should still exist.
---
Hey guys thanks for the answers. I didn't think it would work but was just curious. 
---
Ratings based namely on how good the cards are to be summoned (cards dependant on their battlecry will not fare so well)
---
Excellent: King Mukla, Jungle Panther, Emperor Cobra (hard removal is always a good thing),
---
Good: Nightmare Amalgem, Iron Fur Grizzily, Augmented Elekk.
---
Bad: Messenger Raven, Silverback Patriarch, Blink Fox, Duskbat.
---
Terrible: Iron Beak Owl.
---
Dont remember Ornery Tortoise stats but its battlecry not going off should make it at least a decent roll.
---
I've got a new smartphone I'd love to show up.
---
This isn't one of those things where you need three decks to enter the tournament, is it?
---
Reno shudderwock without any face damage cards (except for the 5/5/5 shuffle a bomb into your opponents deck)
---
&gt; especially when you want to play around opponent's Brawls.
---
Right, so every card ever is a bad card because there's a card that "beats" it.
---
&gt; This card doesn't bring you closer to fatigue and has Dr.Boon's Rush synergy for being a Mech minion.
---
Thank you for stating what I've already said.
---
Picture 1: looks exactly like I thought he would
---
Picture 2: YES EXACTLY

You can host one yourself, set up a private gathering.

Glad someone gets it. Seems r/hearthstone lost a lot of its sense of humor since I left.

4/3/6 | Your other minions have Rush.

Thats not what is says on the Hearthstone Wiki [https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Shudderwock#cite\_note-30max\_1-1](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Shudderwock#cite_note-30max_1-1) 
---
Patriarch is the real highroll
---
Replace Dire Mole with the new 1/1's, replace Razormaw with Headhunter's Hatchet, replace DK Rexxar with Halazzi and maybe 1x Starving Buzzard.  If Control is a problem then add more 6-drops.
---
I think Dire Mole -&gt; Razormaw would have been broken, like Shamanstone Trogg-&gt;Golem level of good, in the new meta.  Everyone is getting powered down, this includes Midrange Hunter.  But Master's Call still exists, so the deck still has powerful things to do.
