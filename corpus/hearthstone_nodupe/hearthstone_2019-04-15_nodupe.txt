We were THIS close to ~~greatness~~ PERFECTION.

Nothing reshuffles your deck unless it's stated in text, afaik cards just go into a random spot in your deck. So OP was booned either way.
---
He's a really bad tempo play for 10 mana, requires your opponent to draw their deck to work, and is easily countered with cards like rafaam and Archivist Elysiana. I made a paladin deck that uses the hakkar-prince Liam combo, but I've never actually won through the bloods, only by them not being able to remove my threats.
---
It makes me sad that Togwaggle isn’t in the top tempo rogue decklist..,
---
He is playing stonetusk boars and made a pun. That's all
---
Golden legendary pity tracker is actually on a separate timer. You can see the rarity of every card opened in the screenshot however.  A Golden legendary is noted as a gold star. None were opened during that period. 
---

---
(Also they are hard to miss! Haha)
---
You could never disenchant new Hall of Fame inductions for its full dust value. It was always just the full refund.
---
Hello Trollden
---
How about 12 mana, so at least you have to earn it with some extreme mana shenanigans.
---
I'm pretty sure you could
---
Ayyyy someone else who turns on "Show touch" in the Developer Options for moments like this
---
It makes broadcasting a phone to a TV and playing as a group so much better.
---
I’m running same list except for Argent Squires I have one Ooze and one Fan of Knives (rank 3). 
---
Ooze is a difference maker against other rogues as well as helps against bomb warrior.
---
Fan of Knives on the first Whispering woods always wins me the game agains Token druid.
---
People want to be able to play wild and standard with w/e deck they want at no costs to them. It’s insane.
---
The moment the card was revealed it was obvious it’s most vital use would be preventing fatigue. Removing bombs or corrupted bloods from your deck was something to consider but it was clearly primarily an anti fatigue card.
---
Having the entire neutral card pool to discover from just means your deck quality is gonna be really shitty afterwards (besides getting an answer like this is suuuuper slow) so there gotta be a really good reason you want a new deck - and there just a limited amount of those.
---
Im guessing its the easiest win in your life with that starting hand.

Somebody set up us the bomb.

Token Druid, Tempo Rogue, and Bomb Warrior.
---
Thanks, that's cool to share the paywalled options with us broke Bois !
---
She makes games go 40 minutes and end it a draw. That is a new one
---
Anyfin Paladin in standard.
---
That would go against what was written in the [Year of the Mammoth announcement article](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/20475356/), where the last thing Team 5 wanted players to feel was the need to disenchant Hall of Fame inductees. Offering a full dust disenchantment would pressure players to do as much.
---
What you got there?
---
I’ve accidentally silenced my own minion before... no copy either... just silenced
---
He clicked the boars and dragged them to the warrior across the board from him. Anyway the boars have dire frenzy.
---
As had been pointed out tracking discards the cards you don't pick. The deck you are playing uses master's call to discover Jepetto
---
No the problem is we lost all good taunt minions the 3 mana drops are so empty now wich is so bad.
---
which means he can just hit up [hsreplay.net](https://hsreplay.net) and find out what every auto complete would be by looking at the best winrate deck for each class.  We can't provide that as it is constantly updating.
---
It definitely is. I was playing mostly BSM when token druid was good a while ago. In literally every logical way imaginable, that should be an absurdly easy win for BSM, but Soul of the Forest meant a deck literally built to survive aggro by wiping wide boards over and over got absolutely dominated by a deck designed to build wide boards over and over.
---
Well that's why standard exists.
---
Yes they don’t want players accidentally thinking they are usable in standard, but that is easily fixable by putting them in the “black markets section that makes it very clear these cards don’t work in standard and requires you take one extra step to get there so people don’t buy them on accident like they think is a fear.
---
From my understanding the first ten packs of any given set which you have not previously opened packs for should contain a legendary. And no, the only effect crafting a legendary has on pack opening is that you can no longer open legendaries which you already have.
---
just stolen steel yourselves a pair of sulthrazes and get those bad boys up to a hundred
---
WELL, LOOK WHO IT IS
---
Yup
---
So the one single counter to bomb warrior is banned because games go long.  Maybe she needs a slight change, like cant discover herself and cant be targeted by spells so she cant go infinite.
---
Or maybe aggro players should grow up, most timed rounds in other tcgs get a minimum of an hour per round already.
---
Zoo is extremely dependent on your opening mulligan, and keeping up pressure. Trading minions in efficiently to kill theirs so you can keep your other minions alive is also important, as is having an idea of what your opponent is playing so you can play around certain things (like keeping stuff to refill the board in case they brawl).
---
As for playing multiple decks, get Whizbang if you can. He can give you any of the 18 pre-made deck recipes, which includes Bomb Warrior, and I think it has Murloc Shaman. Not the most meta decks, but let you play multiple different decks for 1 legendary.
---
Are you using Walking Fountain? I once lost against a Shaman who summoned 6 Walking Fountains, 2 with Eureka from deck, 2 with Eureka from Hagatha and 2 from hand without spells. I just couldn't bring the ass down to 0 hp. Then I got hit with a bunch of overload damage spells and lost 24 hp in one turn.
---
They should remove the rush or windfury from Walking Fountain imho. 8 heal and 8 damage pretty much guaranteed unless there's a big taunt minion with at least 8 damage in the way.
---
How magic carpet is an actual real card is beyond me
---
Warsong Commander got nerfed because of [[Grim Patron]]. I miss it lol. Grim Patron worked exactly like it did in the Grim Guzzler section of Blackrock in WoW. If you fucked up and aggroed one, the entire room attacked you.
---

Speaking from my experience, you might be trading poorly. I know that when I first started out playing zoo/aggro decks. I traded too Much/ for too long. 
---
With decks likes that, you’re meant to trade minions and build a board until maybe turn 5 at the latest. After that you’re looking to end the game as soon as possible. 
---
It would be impossible to say without seeing you play. But try being more aggressive if you think that that might be the problem.
---
This is a bug that happens when you get your new quest during your match(So you play a match at 00:00)
---
You seem fun, I’d like to go to parties with you
---
RIP faerie dragon
---
I guess it doesn't seem fair to base card definitions on abstract interpretation. Unless there is extended documentation for card definitions, isn't it best to use the card definitions themselves? When I look at it from that angle, I can't help but think this has to be a bug. The solution to the bug could be re-defining one of the two cards to account for this OR re-implement either card to account for this use case (if this use case is deemed as correct/valid).  
---
idk.. I'm just salty.. rip my mechs.. xd
---
Obligatory: “I’ll show you a big warrior” comment
---
It’s 50:50.
---
Either it happens or it doesn’t
---
Underbelly Angler only works within a specific deck (Murlocs).  If that archetype is going to be successful it needed something to really give it power.  It’s easy to see why as a class specific card it should be more powerful especially if it also has a tribal synergy.  
---
I would rather they try to push the envelope when promoting tribal decks as opposed to doing too little.
---
Congratulations, you played yoself.
---
5 mana is way too much for buzzard now.
---
Just take a break. I took mine whenever the Year of the Mammoth card back came out (it’s the one I don’t have) and I’ve been able to enjoy the game a lot more since then
---
&gt; Play to win, dont play not to lose
---
This is most player's biggest mistake and what causes them to make easy match ups unfavorable. 
---
For example, a lot of Aggro Rogue players were explaining that they have difficulty piloting the list against Zoo + Token Druid. But those match ups aren't even that unfavorable, if you play them correctly, they are even, if not favored. A lot of players approach the match up with the mentality of Playing to Not Lose, when they should be playing to win. This mentality causes them to make really suboptimal plays, like using their Waggle Pick to hit a 2/2 or 1/1 token instead of going face. They're playing super defensively and against the nature of their deck.
---
You aren’t meant to get exactly every legendary you want. It’s not what you want to hear, but I think it’s better for the meta and most people’s enjoyment of the game.
---
with blizzard being a profit machine and not what I would consider a good-faith studio who value good gameplay over skinner box player-retention mechanics (esp. related to hearthstone), this seems incredibly unlikely that it’d last long before getting cease’d.
---
Won't Zoo and Tempo rogue beat it?
---
Or Luna’s pocket galaxy
---
How is that any different from Standard? It is still just a ladder with established meta decks, they just have different cards in them.
---
Good luck!
---
F
---
I say do it, I'm loving the card so far and you have plenty of dust.
---
Just a quick “instinct check”... if you had to choose between Un’Goro or Ros to win ungodly money... which would you choose?
---
Nice! I got a similar combo recently; prep + vanish + kragwa. With cutlass in play :) I added a poison in after a few turns. She (Hagatha) eventually conceded :)
---
Yeah for the most part. I craft cards sometimes, typically mid expansion I’ll give a deck a try. I like to see what’s fun to play and gives me a change in pace when I hit a bad stretch in arena.
---
Not enough damage to beat old armor shudderwock shaman
---
i dunno do you?
---
Congratulations! Have a useless silver award. Sorry, I'm just a cheapskate. :p
---
I feel icky!
---
Same. I crafted gold Whizbang and I play wild almost exclusively and I haven’t regretted it one bit. If that’s worth it, this is surely worth it.
---
Ben Brode talked a lot about card balance on a video he did about purify, he said that all cards are not supposed to be balanced and blizzard makes stronger cards to push different deck types, the "3/4 with rush" and "0 Mana deal 4 damage" are purposefully strong to make a burgle rogue themed deck real.
---
You just corrupted an innocent soul
---
It's intended. Living Mana worked the same way.
---
You have already lost
---
Especially after a 40 min game of grinding out a control v control game
---
Nah, [[Silverback Patriarch]] is freaking OP.
---
1 and 3 seem like the weakest mana slots for minions
---
Meh. I would've just academic espionage into a pyroblast.
---
3 packs per wing.
---
You also get a golden Zayle (Whizbang type guy with 5 decks) if you complete the whole adventure, and some other minor loot like a cardback and a golden classic pack.
---
I mean bomb warrior is annoying just cause they have like a bajillion board clears ( and when ever i face them they seem to always get them). I do think both decks are retarded, and have to many tools. I still rather token druid though cause then I can have a short game, instead of a game that lasts forever.
---
I did it on day 1. Never looked back. Generated golden value is unmatched
---
Oh boy I sure want warrior have pyroblast
---
I'd say the difference between crafting Golden Rafaam and Whizbang is the fact that with Whizbang all your cards are golden at the start of the game. While with Rafaam you have to fish the card out in order to make your deck gold. I would save the dust and craft a golden Whiz instead
---
Yea, it’s sooo much fun. And I’ve never felt just out of a game, just unlucky. Even when I got blown out. I really just needed warpath
---
It pretty much follows the standard meta cycle. At some point token druid becomes so strong, more people start using it, then people start countering it hard and that draws out more control, etc. etc. Personally I think it's a healthy part of the meta...except for when it was Druidstone after KFT. That was scary...and I mostly play Druid!
---
Look okay i meant to say mortal strike. Idk scott its been a long night
---
djq#11316 NA ill show, u  go first
---
Fuck all three of ya, plus Murloc Shaman.
---
Love, Midrange Hunter
---
The more degenerate deck is usually the one that wins.
---
Dust refund values is the reason I don’t pay for this game. It’s a scam, you don’t get nearly your money’s worth
---
YES WHAT THE HECK THEY REVERTED IT SMH
---
No, it’s the fact they can punish with Savage Roar if you fail to clear any board
---
&gt;mortal strike
---
it is not cooooooooooooooooool enough to post on reddit then :P
---
You're right, I'm comparing them in a vacuum which isn't fair.
---
You think that’s bad? I played against a Bomb Warrior who was running Azalina Soulthief for some ungodly reason. He copied my Archivist, and discovered Wrenchcalibur and Upgrade with it.
---
Even with three extra copies of Witch’s Brew from Kragwa, I couldn’t fuck with that.
---
Haha I did this , I thought it was a cool mechanic where your opponent has to play two minions of the same cost to resuming his minion on board like an offensive dormant
---
Part of what makes Rafaam so powerful is the amount of cards you have in hand when you play him. He's infinitely better with a large hand than he is with an empty hand.
---
You get 16 RoS packs when playing through the single player content.
---
No his facts are right. its just blizzard's inconsistent programming
---
what up big fella
---
Can we start using r/fuckdruid again?
---
I'd like you see how well you do in ranked lmao.  You must be one of the people top players are getting bored of.
---
Conjurer's Call needs to go. Absolute horseshit card. Every game against mage ends up like this on turn 6 at the latest.
---
Edit: Well this blew up...
---
Ugh, everytime I see your list I get more and more tempted to burn the 2.5k dust I'm missing to finish it off. I love how it doesn't run any of the highroll discover cards hoping to get something and instead focuses on just being aggressive and efficient.
---
You thought
---
the first two legendaries i opened were millhouse... I dont know how i didnt quit right then
---
That's pretty much what it is. It's in the deck for when you're going to lose anyways so you either steal a win with something like Talanji or you go out in style.
---
kikers?
---
Do the quest rewards give you guaranteed legendaries? From today’s quest out of 4 packs I pulled 3 legendaries, which seems pretty unlikely... so I’m suspicious...
---
I haven't played in a while. I didn't realize that Wild was rank locked. I've always played it because I couldn't play enough to consistently earn new packs.
---
Sure Mr. Stuck at Rank 12, sure. Complain about aggro being braindead. Maybe it's your brain that's the problem.
---
I would argue this is a bit of a giant meta ;P
---
I have also thought about running Tinkmaster but I do not have him and don't want to commit the dust if it doesn't work out. But he is also great as a pseudo polymorph in a deck that really doesn't run many spells
---
Still need some dust in case I want to craft Rafaam
---
&gt;we want interaction
---
&gt;no no not that kind, the kind I want specifically
---
Agreed! I actually was 1 win away from legend multiple times, but never felt extremely salty like in the last couple expacs
---
I dont think any other class really has the tools to support a no win condition deck like Control Warrior does. You can consistently remove everything until both decks are empty whilst getting an enormous health pool, it was the same with old Odd warrior except it used other cards like Elise and the taunt beast to sustain your deck
---
As much as it pains me to say it, defile and psychic scream were unfortunately token druid's biggest weakness and it makes me miss them
---
They took ice lance from mage and nerfed war axe. Unless they nerf Warlock hero power zoo will always live.
---
if you only have fun for five days after an expansion launch maybe hearthstone isn't for you
---
I have Tinkmaster and tested it out, it didn't work out. Way too inconsistent.
---
Bomb Warrior gets countered by Token Druid, Mechrattle Hunter, Hecklebots, and Weapon Hate. Bomb Warrior seems strong because it both preys on some aggro and unoptimized lists. Bomb package is strong but mostly it gets carried by the Raven Control Warrior tools.
---
It’s a mix token floods the board then sometimes buffs and sometimes doesn’t even need to. I try to go aggressive but it’s hard to always have board control with so many minions.
---
You’re just a typical internet troll who came to this post hunting for an argument. 
---
You didn’t speak like a normal person, or give insight as to why you do or don’t disagree. I brought up what I consider to be the poor state of the game, and how I feel it could be fixed. By cutting cheat/swing plays. 
---
The game has declined on twitch viewership every year since 2015 for a reason (Aside from expansion releases). Multiple big name streamers have quit over the last year or so for a reason. And it’s not cause the game is great. 
---
Plenty of “pro” hs players have quit. Which proves it isn’t about winning, cause they damn sure don’t have a problem winning. Like I said, even when I win it feels like shit in the process. 
---
Also, like I said in my post, I’m rank 2 right now. Which is proof I’m climbing just fine. I’ll be legend again this month, but that’s not the point.
---
Seems likely. Have done this.
---
"Half of 2100 is 950"  
---
 Hmmm
---
Yeah u know a card is broken when u feel dirty just playing it
---
RoS isn't even remotely close to the power level of neutrals in like ungoro.
---
You could pretty much make a completely valid T2 from neutrals alone.
---
I don't mind the concede before lethal, I mind those that empty their hand and fuck around and then concede, if you just wanna queue up asap again you cut that BS out. For ropers i found doing the same to them very effective, none of them have my patience, they want a fast win by conceding annoyed opponents, I drag it to 50 minutes if I have to.
---
Well this subreddit is 95% control players so it makes sense that they hate anything not control.
---
There is no ‘twinspell’ on it so there is only 1 copy. But yeah, basically it takes you to get rid of ‘twinspell’ the turn before the combo
---
7 hours, it was a nice run
---
For what it's worth, a glance at HSReplay says mech paladin is slightly favoured, and several other decks have 50-50 winrates against token druid (like Silence Priest and Tempo Rogue).
---
What i usually do is add people i beat in arena (fuck the people who beat me i am too salty to give them a prize) and offer it if they accept. Usually people will stick around on my friendlist and sometimes offer a quest back to me. Also dont have any real life friends left who play the game
---
850*
---
Shaman can. I run a list with the only condition is too stop aggro and outvalue control.
---
I don't think he meant a programming restriction, I think he meant Blizzard doesn't want to add more buttons.
---
badmarggray sent you a post by memebase
---
yeah there's 8 that i counted. also had one of the most iconic nuetral legendary win conditions in most decks, lich king.
---
shit old kele' boi, bonemare, geist, saronite, happy ghoul, scalebane, and bone drake. wait, 9 because prince 3 was in warlock? nah.
---
Yep thats what i do, but only to the ones that i win over, im too salty to give free gold to the losses
---
Quik maths
---
theres a saying i like to preach to humans but i guess i can apply it to hearthstone classes: "Everyone is equal. Equally worthless."
---
Fuck priest
---
"Created by the lich king"  --&gt; there's two Lich Kings left in the deck.
---
Yes. It would.
---
Well yeah in this case sure, but in general, is that how it works? Like if you had a discounted mechathun and ray of frost, can you just drop mechathun and play RoF, RoF?
---
yeah but un'goro's true power of love was saying goodbye to so many shit cards, and being cheap because disenchanting said shit cards meant you get to play for free.
---
Yea the fact is you have to draw it to do that... :(
---
He used psychic scream and removed my 2 lich kings but they were right in top of the deck hahahaha
---
The deck easily survives until resurrection turns because of all the crazy removal Priest has.
---
I don't think any card in Hearthstone history has ever been hit as badly as Warsong Commander was during the Patron Warrior days
---
As a token druid player atm on rank 3 token druid has massive disadvantage on rogue(not every rogue) right now. And guess what most people run? Rogue.
---
Anyways, just bare in mind that druids don't have many 1 drops and many times their opening round is bad. Many decks take advantage of it. To name a few, murloc shaman, warlocks are some decent counters. Rogues that have made a certain tech that I can't say(I play druid in ladder lol) also counter heavily druids.
---
Every year several old sets rotate out of standard, which means you can still play those cards in wild, but can't put them in standard decks.
---
Jeweled macaw and crackling razormaw were from the set 2 years ago, and thus can now only be played in wild.
---
Here's a budget (but quite good) version of the deck that is playable in Stanard:
---
https://hsreplay.net/decks/Zp8MphqhlsFe3UrbL8Jax/
---
I’ve been 12-3 or something against rogue as token druid
---
Well that iteration of token druid was a midrange/combo deck, not aggro. And midrange and combo typically eat control.
---
The thing about those other decks is that they usually run out of steam pretty quickly. If you get 1 or 2 good AOE against something like zoo, you have a chance at beating them. Token druid is a lot like odd paladin back when it had 5 mana level up, but in this meta there's 3 less expansions of AOE and taunts, plus no Death Knights to stabilize.
---
I got to go Krag'wa + Divine Hymn + Seance a few days ago. That was sick.
---
Plenty of pros have quit, because that's what people do, they move in. Others have come to take their place instead.
---
I didn't provide anything of substance to start with, because it wasn't needed. Your post was just a mindless rant trying to push an agenda. It was super obvious that you don't care about the other side of the conversation, so why waste the effort? 
---
RoS is possibly the expansion with the least swing cheat cards ever printed, right after they massively nerfed ramp cards. Ressurect priest is back, but they moved it to late game value and 0 ways to cheat out of the deck. Conjure mage is completely fine, you have to destroy a minion of that cost to get a new one. They have big power swings, but what deck doesn't.
---
I think you missed the point about my comment on your legend rank. I don't fucking care what rank you are. If your rank 20 or top 200 legend, it would make crap all difference.
---
All I read is Mimimimi and *crybaby noises*
---
Yea, just had my first daughter, and finally got her home. There is still 5 hours to go, thought I had time.
---
Not for newer players though.
---
Cool. Thanks.
---
Continues? This is a really rare scenario, Let him have the nuts for once.
---
We must preserve it in amber.
---
Thanks, it’s doing ok but I’m stuck at 15 with it. I’ll try some other builds
---
The RP, I imagine.
---
I use research project, if I can also burn my opponent, and the add two random minions just to generate hand size... I can still keep the cheap spells in deck to deal with early game
---
Yeah but now theres two
---
He meant [Possessed Lackey]
---
Being able to make your own formats for tournaments and other stuff would do WONDERS for improving how fresh the game feels. You can see this kind of shit when all those expansions cycle out
---
Yup, just went face every turn
---
&gt;Then more people would play wild,
---
You say that, but Wild can be a lot less forgiving than standard.
---
I think the reason is a lot more simple, if Blizzard get involved with Wild, they will be in a never ending loop of trying to balance it. So they will just leave it be and not recommend it... despite it being a core aspect of the game.
---
Nope
---
I’ve yet to lose to a token Druid with my tempo rogue. You just treat token Druid like any other Afro deck, take out the board first, chip away at health when you can.
---
*That’s literally every card.
---
Can’t play cards from your deck. *usually*
---
Be quite if Al'Akir or Ragnaros asks where the insects are. They have something bad about insects, don't know what
---
Bomb warrior is definitely the most popular right now
---
just dust them lol
---
I think it comes from the decks having slight similarities to Magic the Gathering tempo decks, which rely on playing early threats and protecting them while slowing the opponent to a crawl. Sap is a perfect example of a tempo card. It basically undoes the opponent’s last turn at an extremely cheap price.
---
The thing is... Nothing else in the deck resembles Magic’s concept of tempo whatsoever. It’s just an aggro deck with Sap.
---
That we do. The “Watch and Learn” and Challenge a friend for 80G quests are all taken care of as a part of this arrangement :)
---
750*
---
clearly getting that W!
---
I agree, but I can assure you they'll never change this.
---
Looking at the history bar. Hmmmm
---
Then im never lucky and the game ia bullshit
---
Doing the overload murloc shaman, works quite well. The problem is that Savage Roar is a lot more useful and economic than Bloodlust and that treants gets health buffed Blessing of the Ancients which makes them able to trade favorably with weak murlocs
---
There are games like League of Legends or Fortnite that stay fresh by constantly introducing new things, so their playerbase stays strong.
---
Hearthstone isn't doing that, so lots of players are leaving.  That's all.
---
I'm sorry but that thumbnail....anyone else?
---
ok
---
The Rotten Applebaums I see on history bar probably healing mage back to full
---
Every new expansion is my last expansion))
---
&gt;I already felt like this was the case when they cancelled tournament mode and opted to rehash Dungeon Run many times over 
---
It's safe to say if they didnt make a "sequel" to dungeon run that people would've been butthurt about that too.  People WANTED more dungeon run style content.
---
Are you trying to see people shouldn't be forced to do a job they don't like? Well well well... Good thing some people are lucky enough to have a community really to support them no matter what I guess.
---
Didn't the last patch add the ability to reroll Legendary Quests?
---
You could always play in Wild to use those cards.
---
I don’t think a format that somewhere in between standard and Wild really makes any sense. I don’t think the tavern brawls have been fun pretty much ever, so I would like them to actually do literally anything to the game.
---
It also lines in the obvious format issues too. It would be nice to hold tournaments or have any way of creating an in game community. You know, like an equivalent to Magic nights over the internet that is more engaging.
---
Wild cards are impossible to get unless you craft it, so really the card becomes more expensive when it enters wild. Which... is going to push people away from the 1/3 things they could actually do in the game.

There’s no game modes, no attempt at new game modes, no ways to make our own game modes or formats or game rules. The game succeeds at the thing it’s going for too much. The simplicity leaks into playstyles, it leaks in to the simple game modes, and I’m glad many people can enjoy it... but I’ve never heard someone disengage from a product from being at a normal level of complexity. I understand something like warframe and PoE turning people off even if many people would like it, but Hearthstone is, for lack of a better word, a stupid game. A stupid game that so obviously has more interest in discouraging you owning cards to play.
---
What Blizz needs to do is create a sandbox mode where we have maybe 10 parameters we can adjust to create our own formats and each expac they add a new dimension or two. 
---
Like: number of copies in a deck, number of cards in a deck, hand size, life at start, class composition, ban list, etc. 
---
Then have a lobby where players can queue into various rulesets with eligible decks and then Blizz can use their extensive data to analyze what is most popular and start supporting that as a full-fledged game mode. 
---
They need to stop asking us what we want, give us as much control as possible, and then just watch what we do. They can outsource game modes to the community and then stop hiring mode designers.
---
Exactly how Magic started making Commander products and now a format they didn’t create is their most popular.
---
Most other video games do. 
---
And a preorder won't get you multiple decks unless you get really lucky. 
---
However, comparing hearthstone to any game other than MTG (which is also overpriced) will make people unhappy.
---
I always have too many cards when I finally get around to togwaggle, but they tremble in their boots when I slam down two nat pagles.
---
Somebody get this man a job at Blizzard.

Dredge is a deck based around cards like Life from the Loam and other cards with the Dredge mechanic. Dredge allows you to put cards from the top of your deck into the graveyard. Basically, you run spells that put cards in your graveyard,  cards that return cards from your graveyard to your hand, and creatures that have graveyard recursion so they keep coming back. You end up with a never ending number of threats that keep coming back no matter how many times your opponent kills them. It’s gotten a reputation as a solitaire deck because you don’t really care what your opponent does, you just put cards into your graveyard and bring creatures back over and over again until you win.

Mech pally has a strong enough early game to stay alive long enough to put up big taunts and token druid doesn't run silence. The secret version is slightly unfavored because it takes so long to get good taunts up but the galvanizer version can have a 2/10 taunt up by turn 3.
---
OP obviously used different measurements, as there's no deck in the game right now with 65+% winrate, cause it would've been a major uproar and there'd be a nerf announcement out already.
---
Sorry for the late reply, its the druid 1 drop from the new expansion
---
It's the good old mind control problem. Mind control used to be underpowered at 8 mana. It got nerfed to 10 mana because bad players felt bad losing to it.
---
The game has no room for creative decks.
---
Thank you mate, I use a way more late game focused most but I will give yours a shot
---
Coz the top class and Decks right now are all running it
---
r/fuckpriest
---
in b4 huffer double skill command
---
Bullshit on so many levels.
---
I’ve been playing Dragon Mage since Apxvoid created the deck, and I’ve managed to pull the combo in 3 games out of around 40-50. You don’t just have book and giant on mulligan every single game, or either by turn 3.
---
What pisses me off the most about single player content is that each mode consistently does something well that I wish the next mode would fix, and sometime that happens and sometimes it doesn't and they end up making things worse.
---
And it's not like Dungeon Run is without sin either. I'd argue that compared to Rumble Run and Monster Hunt, Dungeon Run's RNG is quite literally a run-killer, and not all bosses, treasures, and classes are anywhere near created equal. I've lost great runs to Candlebeard, the statue guy, and freaking A.F. Kay because I rolled them when I was playing a slow deck and also drew poorly early on. Dungeon Run without good treasure luck (and bucket synergy) is an absolutely boring slog, and that's only compounded by the fact that 1/3 of the classes are exceptional, 1/3 are a decent challenge, and 1/3 make you want to hate yourself. (Fuck Priest in particular) And don't even get me started on the RNG-fest that is the final bosses. 
---
Comparing that to Monster Hunt: 
---
* +The 4 playable classes were *mostly* closer to one another balance-wise and enjoyability-wise, with the exception of Toki unless you pull her double-cast treasure. 
---
* +Every class had base-line power to them that made them stand out from the rest of the playable classes. 
---
* +The unique, character specific treasures were very fun to play around with. 
---
* +Having a set final boss for each character so you can build a deck around them and their gimmicks. 
---
* +Having a final battle to shoot for that functions as a climax to the whole mode. 
---
* -- Throwing the new and almost literally game-changing treasures into a random pool with the old ones really hurts the treasure RNG. 
---
* --Toki. Just, Toki. Such cool potential, especially with her treasures...but she's such complete garbage base-line. 
---
And then we got Rumble Run, which was a whole other host of good and bad:
---
* +The different shrines should have added a ton of replayability and enjoyment to the mode, and somewhat did, after the much less diverse Monster Hunt. 
---
* +You got stuff right at the beginning so you already had a strong, unique, and enjoyable deck right off the bat. 
---
* +The treasures were SO. MUCH. BETTER. than both Dungeon Run and Monster Hunt, and changed things up quite a bit (even if the minion treasures were very much pidgeonholed based on what Shrine you pick)
---
* --The bosses were the most uncreative and un-fun of any of the Dungeon Runs, except for maybe Dungeon Run itself. They're just other shrine decks, with no creative mechanics and no real conclusive ending. 
---
* --Speaking of that, the Shrines! Good god, not only does picking  your CLASS come down to RNG, but even when it comes to shrines within a class you have massive variance between game-winning and just bland and boring. It's worse-balanced than Dungeon Run, and that's saying a LOT. 
---
My desires for future single-player content are fairly similar, but with a couple differences. 
---
* Immersive in both setting/feel and playability. 
---
* Well-balanced, equally enjoyable playable options. I don't care if it's less than 9 total, I just want them all to get equal attention and be of equal quality. I'd take something that's less replayable if the first playthrough is damn good. 
---
* Unique bases to work from. If I wanted to play the base classes, I'd either play Dungeon Run or Standard. I want the single player to stand out from both of those and to give me more of an experience I can't get anywhere else. Take notes from Darius and Tess. 
---
* Going off of that, better base-line power levels. Make things unique and strong from the very beginning, rather than having to earn having the mode be fun.
---
You knew this was gonna happen the moment they released the druid cards.
---
genn/baku impacted the game without ever havign to be drawn OR played.  Theres a reason they got carted off to Hall of fame.
---
Any luck here?
---
Would you consider the old paladin dk exodus deck a degenerate deck though? Granted the combo is unstoppable after he gets all the pieces and done the setup, but the chances of that happening is of a pretty low percentage.
---
The reason why I consider aggro decks a degenerate deck instead is because it deters casual players from starting the game. If a casual player thought up of a neat combo, like the olde lightwarden healing rain combo, they almost cant ever pull it off in an aggro matchup for obvious reasons. They are forced to go netdecking or play aggro to counter them, and it takes away the fun for some.
---
Play big minions early; mountain giant, twilight drake,  sunfury protector, big taunt minions in the mid game and you won’t have any problems. Khadgar Mage beats it.
---
You should have sold your BattleNet account. You'd at least have some money for the collection.
---
&gt; which was your only option against other Rogues
---
Well you *do* still discover a card from another class.
---
Battlecry caps to 100 damage I think.
---
We got a free legendary this expansion as well. I think blizzard has done a pretty swell job this expansion with give aways. But honestly, no matter what they do, players always find a way to complain.
---
It was a joke bro, don't need to get defensive.
---
I was able to go infinite until the last day, and I got 2 legendaries from it. Can't complain
---
As a pleb I do that cause every action I take is a small step to levelling my hero to lvl60
---
&gt; I'm not their target customer anymore.
---
Their target audience are the people who used to play Farmville...
---
HAHAHA ITS A V BAD DECK
---
Dark Age of Camelot is still a thing?
---
he's pretty balanced tbh, 3/2 is hardly a threat to serious decks
---
without Oblivitron the power level of the deck is reduced by a lot. It's better to have it if u want to play it.
---
PewDiePie (a YouTuber) released a track "Congratulations" to TSeries( an Indian Music Channel) when TSeries overtook pewd in subscriber count. 
---
And there's this running trope that all of pewd's fan base is 9 years old.
---
And since OP is Indian and you said congratulations thought you are referencing that.
---
Well obviously you need to discard. T4 Cataclysm and concede will get you there.
---
Lol
---
People don't like to hear it, but auto-conceding is a serious option if Resurrect Priest is the largest barrier to your enjoying wild. I'm not excusing Blizzard's outright neglect of the format; they are absolutely responsible for me having to suggest something so aggravating. However, we can only play the formats as they exist today and I'm having an enjoyable and priest-free time in Wild.
---
Besides, if you were rabidly devoted to reaching high rank at any cost, you'd be playing that cancer yourself.
---
Agree with everything except Ubisoft, even though it prints Creed games every year - it still has a robust gallery and support ongoing games like RS6:Siege and For Honor. Still they got issues that pop up every now and then; as well as the microtransactions, which is an industry wide problem.
---
I agree, but at the same time Kobolds and Catacombs offered a much higher amount of mana cheating than pretty much every set released prior combined.
---
Granted, part of card games seems to generally be figuring out how to circumvent the cost of playing the big bois.
---
Why did you even cast this? Looks like you have lethal anyway.
---
Dennis is that you?
---
Ok, I stand corrected.
---
What do you mean, "even" control shaman? Isn't it kind of expected that a deck that typically skips the first four turns because it runs nothing but lategame minions struggles against early aggro?
---
Don't get me wrong, I hate face decks as much as the next guy... but I find it hard to blame them for being advantaged against the type of deck that they actually *should* be advantaged against.
---
Oh yeah, aggro definitely beats token.  (Aggro mage is fun too, with the deal 1 mana to adjacent minions)
---
There is a.pity timer. It's ~1 in 400 for a particular set though so it's hard to hit.
---
Archmage Vargoth by himself is a better giveaway card than pretty much any random legendary given out in the last year.
---
True
---
So far this new expansion seems a bit more promising. There are still some cards that seem problematic, but the meta is still adjusting
---
finished a 10 win run in arena and got a black knight. Does it seem weak to you? Just not sure when I would want this tech card.
---
Dora auto chess
---
Sadly, part of the reason is that most of the rewards require winning. If Blizzard adjusted the awards to incentivize playing over winning, we'd probably see more creative decks.
---
Yeah. It's going to rotate because Team 5 wants to periodically make a new version of the card with different decks like the Zayle Shadow Cloak releasing alongside the solo content.
---
i can give u a good list add me if u want zeg247#2891
---
everyonegetinhere.com is one too
---
Its so funny people are complaining and they are the same damn people that keep buying cards and playing the game.  
---
I agree with pretty much most things said here about how blizzard doesn't do anything really like make new formats, and personally i think its disgusting just how many cards get played in a game that do not even start in your deck. It's like they aren't even trying to make hearthstone a real game anymore, yet they still doing the whole competitive thing because it makes them money I guess?  
---
We can complain and "quit" all we want, but when we keep buying and coming back whenever new cards come out, nothing is going to change. Blizzard is just going to keep milking us.
---
I mean the viewer numbers streamers get for autochess isn't that bad. Will they make less income? Yes. Will they lose all their subs and viewers? No. This is a way to keep streaming without quitting because it's making you miserable.
---
Nothing beats cutesy patootsy 1/1/1 C'Thun from [[Gurubashi Hypemon]] though. Just saying.
---
Yup, friend's account was like that too. I had already made a deck, but didn't lock it in yet
---

7/5/7 | Battlecry: Discover a 1/1 copy of a Battlecry minion. It costs (1).  
---
Same here man. Keep the Elesiana hate coming.
---
Yes
---
Or play token druid and win.
---
&gt; Soul of the Forest might be the core problem.
---
5 year old cards barely seeing play finally getting a deck they perform well in are "the core problem".
---
Cool. I got Flark but struggle using mechs around him. Could you share what you have? Cheers
---
Aggro sucks
---
Control sucks
---
You'd probably say combo sucks too
---
So, Midrange is all the game should be?
---
To show my opponent what I had, what my play was going to be.
---
The pack was a shadows pack. Did you preorder because it would have gotten lumped with those.
---
I feeL you, once I got a choice between a 1/1 , 2/2 and 3/3.
---
Deck has poor winrate vs zoo.
---
if you play wild, id recomend you post your thread on r/wildhearthstone ,they also have evry week/2weeks or so thread about fun decks normally.
---
 but for non meta but not terrible deck i recomend jade rogue in wild :) i have around 400games with it total. you can build it alot of ways n'zoth vs battlecry focus for example or more tempo build or go full on infinite with lab recruiters and such.

I see. I always have the feeling of stepping into a sunken cost fallacy. But then I shall give it a try.
---
Hey man!
---
It's good that you’re being honest with your goals. Rank 3 is a good level, and you should be able to get to Legend in 2 months max with proper studying. I wrote a post about it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/9w86d1/reaching\_legend\_tilt\_mindset\_and\_confidence/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/9w86d1/reaching_legend_tilt_mindset_and_confidence/)
---
It seems like it could help you, especially on the mentality issues you are talking about. Good luck on the journey! The first time is always great!
---
I havnt played league in over 3 years and no desire to play again. HS i rage quit every other month
---
why 1 non golden deck when you can have 18 golden ones ?
---
From rank 5 to legend it's a grind. You simply need to play a LOT of games to reach legend. Being good helps, and really knowing the meta decks can't hurt. 
---
Imagine this, with a 55% win rate, you need 227 games (rank 5 to legend) on average - math done on hearthpwn. 
---
So gear up and start the grind :P 
---
My best is rank 3, but the grind got to me, and now I barely reach rank 5 - I just play for fun now.
---
I made a hunter with 2 knife jugglers 2 unleashes, the 1 mana rush minions, snake trap and hyena's. Works wonders agaimst token druid. Won a few times around turn 4 or 5 because of huge unleash and hyena combo.
---
if only he was useful
---
Ah,  I see,  thank you.When this will happen? And what is ur personal favourite deck?
---
Tbf this expansions has great epics but you can make some of the best decks without crafting any new Legendaries.
---
You can make Token Druid for a reasonable amount of dust and you don't really need Keeper Stalladris. You also don't really need Greenskin, Myra's or Tog for Tempo Rogue and there are cheap, strong Hunter variants.
---
If you don't like Epics at all, this set has Ursatron which is great for Wild Mech Hunter which can easily get you to Legend and can be built without a single Epic or Legendary.
---
These are just a few examples. My point is this expansion is pretty affordable overall if you have a decent collection already and there are cheap ways into Wild as well, if one is interested.
---
Yeah, but it's only one card, which also might heavily gimp your deck after playing it and can also be pulled with hecklebot (another deck manipulation offender), so ya know? It might be the best counter we have but it's more like a bucket of water to a raging forest fire.
---
Honestly I think i get this as an option 80% of the time. Otherwise its toki
---
I haven't played it since February, had some fun with DnD RPGs. Now Im back in the game and it feels pretty good with the rotation and everything.
---
When did I complain?
---
I did it day 1. No regrets. It never occoured to me to craft cgolden wHizzbang. Damnit wiah i did that
---
Everyone complaining about Bomb Warrior and Token Druid.
---
Meanwhile the top decks by winrate look like this: https://hsreplay.net/decks/#sortBy=winrate
---
Only reason the "archetype" winrates don't reflect this is that their categorization of decks into archetypes is not good.
---
It's because there's a wall of value when it comes to packs. 
---
$180 will pretty much get you everything you want, and enough dust to craft what you missed. 
---
However, less than that pretty much gets you nothing.
---
It's a general boredom trend, look at DisguisedToast, when he plays HS it feels like he's not enjoying it at all.   
---
Check his last stream when someone asked what HS is : " if you're ready to spend 500 bucks to have a glimpse of fun destroyed by everyone playing the same meta deck then go. This new expansion is the right time to get in ". He then apologized to Blizzard but... Is he wrong ?
---
Strange, I was in the middle of making a deck, then my wife went into labor. Got home yesterday with 5 hours to spare, no luck.
---
Control warrior and zoolock
---
She still streamed Hearthstone occasionally, but yeah, you're pretty much right, she practically quitted Hearthstone long time ago.
---
Your opponents name is finnish and translates to "Military boner".
---
I really want to see this photoshopped onto the "now thats what I call music" album.
---
She's entirely correct. I play mainly Arena and despite Arena receiving a massive change in the card pool even Arena doesn't feel any different at all. It's the same cards with different numbers.
---
Did you throw it back with your face?
---
Pretty sure she chooses to stream. Don't act like shes such a victim for getting paid to play games.
---
A mobile game can still be complicated though, and even before mobile was announced Hearthstone never had any way to interact with an opponent's turn aside from secrets. Team 5 just don't want to do anything.
---
Anyone considered that streaming stuff like hearthstone or autochess is in itself a craze people will get bored of? After a while they're all the same, using same gimmicks to retain viewers,  the same acting pretending whatever to the viewers... i don't think stuff like twitch keeps growing indefinitely.
---
MTGA is a real threat here. Hearthstone always had a better implementation, but Magic was the better game. The first isn't true any more.
---
I honestly think ur the first to post this on reddit, over a year after the expansion came. Amazing that you found it!

I don't get the hate towards games as a service. Hearthstone might not be the best example of it, but games like CSGO, Dota 2, PUBG, Fortnite, Overwatch, Rainbow 6 Siege and many others have made it look really good in my opinion. Certainly much better than games that are released and then completely forgotten about.

The coin makes your current mana go up to 10, playing [[Omega Assembly]] makes your mana go down to 9 at which point the game reads the card text, the card text is therefore read after you lose that extra mana so you only have 9, the forbidden cards work in the same way. If you increase their cost, they activate with that amount ofmana less in their effect.
---
So why do you get three cards when at ten mana when you only have 9 left after playing it? It looks at your max mana as well, so then it can see that you have 10 mana.
---
I'm not sure about reducing the cost of the card but I imagine it would work as you originally assumed if you have 10 current mana after playing the card.
---
enjoying part is 100% subjetive, but its winrate isnt over the top its not even tier 1.

It's almost like team 5 printed strong cards to try and get more people to buy packs or something...
---
I crafted all mage new cards yesterday (mage being my favorite class) and I’m not disappointed.
---
But bomb warrior and tempo rogue seems to be the best decks so far. I’m tempted to spend my 7k on whatever the deck needs.
---
maybe the dragon warrior version is better against them,having 2 extra execute effects from the  smolderthorn lancers is in theory good against these big bois
---
In 2018 I mostly played Wild, got Legend there a couple of times, and then I quit the game in January, after having played since December 2013. Wild was as you would expect at the higher levels, every deck was incredibly powerful, and if you were trying with a homebrew, well good luck to you. 
---
I've never been a deck builder, but I do like variety. Back in the day I liked being able to take a tier 2 or tier 3 deck and pilot it as high as I could, because I enjoyed playing the deck. Eventually though, you just see meta decks that are so refined that you have to play another tier 1 deck to compete with it most of the time.
---
I've always thought that they should rotate in some different expacs here and there, but they never did and now I'm not coming back to the game.
---
He'll probably just get Frost Nova from Babbling Book and freeze all the cars.

a streamer quitting looks a bit like a divorce.

theres the classy divorce, where both go separated, they have respect for eachother but have grown apart (day9, hafu, reynad?,...)
---
than theres the petty one, every opportunity theres a jab thrown at the ex-partner (amaz comes to mind)
---
than theres the disastrous, ungrateful one that u leave in a big fight and let everyone on social media know how u couldnt wait for it to end (savjz, stancifka)
---
in all cases both parties need to change a bit to get the best of eachother.

Is crystallizer played in zoolock for any reason besides a 1/3 body?
---
It's honestly blizzards dream come true in terms of deck design. No spells, no big combos, just minions and trading. Zoo is the gateway for a lot of new players I would imagine.
---
That is a high roll. If you pull the smaller minions you spent your entire turn to ping the board 3 times.
---
He does, just doesn't exactly pull in the numbers the other guys do. Last week or so he's at ~5k-7k
---
How is priest uninteractive? Especially compared to aggro
---
I think it is correct

uau, incredible, not cool, this post needs to be taken down, go fy you miserable crying kid

Most impressive! It's like before he was nerfed in Vanilla WoW.
---
List?
---
1300 packs? Hey it's me, your pack-less brother
---
not just streamers. people were hoping for something new with this meta. but instead we went from 1 shotting out of nowhere to swing board states that are uncountable. the game has to many insta-concede decks atm and its just not fun.
---
Why did you pre-order this expansion when they announced that there wouldn't be any major changes this year? Everything added was basically QoL
---
Well, I’m really sorry if this is a common repost
---
lol what an unnecessarily hostile response
---
You still have to draw it, and most of the meta decks can get rid of it on turn two with little issue. By the time you are Christmasland playing it with Scargil your deck is already full of bombs or you're about to get Druid rushed.
---
This dude was probably trying to trade with the sword.
---
Yeah, I can load up DotA 2 and (attempt) to do the exact same thing as a TI winner at the cost of zero dollars. I would have to buy in hundreds of dollars to be able to play around the same decks as a popular Hearthstone streamer.

Looks like a new yes deck on a rising.

I think players want more meat and potatoes. I know I log in excited, play three or four games and lose interest, and that's fine, but I need something to keep me coming back. Varied deck types, strats, rules, and honestly new types of content. New cards are cool, but they're not free and unless you want to drop some dough for a small pool of cards, it's hard to keep up. Which is ironic, as they wont make changes to existing cards for fear of alienating returning players, when returning players are alienated by lack of cards to begin with
---
as a new player, i dusted Thaurisan, Jaraxxus and Antonidas. i opened antonis far later. just need thaurisan and jaraxxus now to ease the regret
---
I was lucky enough to unpack a golden Rafaam on day 1, and I have to say, it is amazing. Now, I don't play standard much and I have found little to no competitive use for him in Wild, but those few games with Zoolock in Standard have been a blast and Rafaam is a one card wincondition. I'd imagine as long as the power level in standard stays low'ish, this dude will see play. 
---
The only Golden Legendary I've ever crafted has been N'Zoth and I have zero regrets. Cards that generate golden cards are indeed sweet. 
---
And frankly, it feels great to have a hand of golden legendaries. Do it.
---
Unsure! They come out fairly unregularly, maybe one every 2-3 weeks, I imagine the next one will be out about 2 weeks from now.
---
If you want to take a look at their most recent one  check out https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot (but remember it's outdated now!)
---
I've been playing a lot of Token Druid (I was playing it at the start of the expansion, matched up well against Bomb Warrior). How about you?
---
wow why did it crash that hard?
---
Without seeing your checklists, I would say whizbang is a good craft. If your decks are lacking, his decks are a good option and have good synergy.
---
You could try playing Wild with your existing collection, just as a way to dip your toes back in the water, while you buy newer packs / craft newer cards.
---
I had opened the pack on the fireside gathering during the weekend pre-expantion
---
That video title makes me want to play the mega millions, and add the mega-plier
---
Your experience is limited to the losing side. The deck gets rolled under many circumstances. It’s not OP, you’re just losing to it a lot. Figure out how to beat it. That’s what the rest of us do.
---
Mylos #2877 EU trading 80g quest
---
A lot of the times as well, it seems that quite a few of the hated decks are fun to play but not fun to play against. 
---
Most control players will be calculating, when to clear, to pair that with healing, can they wait one more turn to get the most value etc etc. 
---
But the opponent sees you do nothing , do nothing then stabalise. 
---
Bomb Warrior same problem. 
---
Dam a 3-3 for 3 is pretty low tempo, if i play that i might go on the back foot so i should hard mulligan for board clears if im keeping that in my hand. 
---
Opponent sees , oh a 3 mana do nothing turn in the hope to RNG burst later ..... "fun"
---
&gt; edit: me disagree? me downvote &gt;:[
---
token druid players getting legend want to believe it was skill that got them there.
---
And when she does, it’s always of her cleaning her room!
---
The game was probably already won if you picked Cho and won after that. There is no way Cho was the game swinging factor.
---
Far too many people do well too consistently for RNG to affect things as much as those percentages suggest. Like yeah, RNG influences losing streaks, but you never see frequent legend players try and fail to hit legend, you know?
---
Just a connection issue. Nothing to see here.

There are worse decks... Heal druid has its strenghts, tier 4, but playable imo. Dog had some decent winrate im top 100 legend with it.
---
This is too true. Many game live past their expiration date due to custom user created features(like mods) If Blizzard was able to open up hearthstone to an api, or allow for customizable games(60 hp game, 200 card decks), you can have the community handle the staleness for you.
---
Gets killed by hemet
---
Honestly he should have just dropped edwin, daggered to kill his pick, then dropped edwin again as 18/18.
---
Anyway how the hell is edwin 16/16 with the opponent at 5/6 mana?
---
I don't know. i kind of disagree with this statement.
---
Say what you will, hyper aggro decks were bullshit. But... games were done or you could get the right cards and have a fighting chance. So long as you played your resources correctly/planned.
---
With DKs, it was "I got the right card, now I just win" or "fuck I didn't get the card, I just lose". It is like there is no middle ground.
---
Remember, match polarization was always a thing, but people didn't really start seriously talking about it until we had Dks.
---
This is just my personal take though. I played the shit out of WoTOG and all those hyper aggro metas. And yet I took multiple breaks during year of the Raven (when hyper aggro just wasn't a thing really)... so what changed if the game is the same? Or maybe that is the bigger problem. It is still the same game and it's just gotten to a point where people are realizing it and saying "man, I want something else"

Don’t be another bomb warrior, I think Bomb warrior win rate is so low because literally every second game its Bomb warrior vs Bomb warrior in higher ranks. 
---
Also bomb warrior loses 90% of time to me.
---
&gt; Whose to say how Things will pan out from here on out, though?
---
Because they wont. T5 is a bunch of incapable idiots who should have never been allowed to touch any game. Sure if might work for some kids but the game is objectively bad and just survives of the name. Lets sum up:  
---
  
---
- The game was official released 5(?) years ago. The only features that we got are Tavern Brawl (which is not even up 100% of the time) and Fireside Gathering.  
---
- The client is still extremely buggy, on mobile and desktop. Random crashes and disconnects still happen.
---
- The game became easier and easier, and it seams as they tried to solve difficult decks by making an easy version of the same. (Freeze Mage -&gt; Quest Mage, Mill Rogue -&gt; Kingsbane, Patron -&gt; Recruit Warrior etc.)  
---
- And do I even need to start about balancing? Remember when the community cried about there being almost no early game board clears? Well that doesnt matter anymore, because almost every class can fill the board in one turn again or/and survives boardclears (Soul of the forest/Murloc)  
---
- Wild is pretty much fucked forever
---
Landscaping is better in Druid than this trash 'treasure'. Treants have synergy with multiple cards like Dendrologist, Mulchmuncher and Treespeaker!
---
man i just dont like getting wrecked by netdecks. i respect the hell out of homebrew decks. i dont get mad when they surprise me with what they pull out because i know that it's not just the most efficient set of cards, they just wanted to try something out
---
What if you’re just kinda devoted to reaching legend? I’ve been legend a few times in wild(usually with less powerful stuff like face hunter mill rogue and dragon priest) but now I can’t even hit rank 2 because big priest is way out of line
---
Anyone saying this card is bad is a fool. It’s saved me countless times
---
Murloc Shaman is a cheap brainless deck, so it sees a lot of success at the lower ranks.
---
This sub hates on Token Druid, sometimes rightfully so, but at least that deck requires decision making. Murloc Shaman boils down to "drop murlocs, hit face".
---
That doesn't work past rank 10 though.
---
But... the problem is indeed sact pact. Majordomo Executus is also not a hero card, and it replaces your hero with Ragnaros the Firelord when he dies. Ragnaros is an elemental but does not interact with elemental cards, like Earthen Might. 
---
Also, since sact pac is the only exception on how these sort of interactions work, isn't it logical to assume that it is the one not working correctly? 
---
Anyway, I know this whole interaction is a pretty insignificant thing overall, and I'm probably taking it too seriously. So I apologize for (probably) sounding rude.
---
There's always a way to punish. No matchup is 100 - 0, it's all about finding the win condition and playing to it.
---
I wouldn't dust a RoS legendary until I am certain I won't open another RoS pack.

I mean, does the part where your weapon visibly closes up and your attack disappear not clue you in that it’s inactive?

---
Who wouldn't be burnt out playing the same game 8 hours a day for 5 years. HS just doesn't have the depth of gameplay to be fun for that amount of time. Most of the "Pro" game are all team games so they survive due to the team aspect, plus the depth of gameplay.
---
Multiple time legend player here. 
---
1. Get a deck tracker if you don't have one, and pay attention to your win rate. It's much more important than your rank. Just ignore rank altogether in fact, it will come in time if you have a high enough win rate. 
---
2.  Don't play tilted. Immediately squelch your opponent. If you lose three games in a row, *take a break.* 
---
3.  You should know what you're looking for in your mulligans against every other class. The more unfavored the   
---
matchup, the harder you need to mulligan for the right cards. 
---
4.  Picking one deck and sticking with it is usually the best way to go the first time you want to hit legend, but don't   
---
stick to a deck that's not yielding good win rate for you. 
---
5.  On your turn, before you do anything, think about what you are going to do on your turn, and what your opponent is likely to do on their next turn, and then check to see if your play still make sense. If it does, do it. If it doesn't, do something that does make sense. 
---
Example: Yesterday I'm playing against warrior as mage. I haven't seen a brawl yet, but I assume he has it in his hand because he's holding 9 cards and I haven't seen one yet. I have a 6/6 and an 8/8 on the board. I have two mana left after I play the 6/6. I have a loot hoarder in my hand, and I consider playing it. But then I think, what is he going to do next turn if I play the loot hoarder? He could brawl, and then if he does and the loot hoarder survives, that would be a huge punish. So I just hero power his face instead. They aren't always this obvious, but you get the idea. 
---
   6. When you are ahead you need to be thinking, "how do I lose this?" and  don't take unnecessary risks. Play to minimize your *opponents* outs. when you are behind you need to be thinking "how do *I* win this?" and you may need to start taking risks to try and win that unfavored matchup. play to *your* outs.   
---
7. Reflect hard on your losses and think about why you lost the game and "he had a perfect draw and I didn't draw what I needed." isn't a good analysis, even if it's true :p. 
---
8. Play every game as if it's the final boss.
---
Don't know who that is
---
HS is still fun for new(er) players because everything is so fresh, even the new cards are really "new" to them. But to people who have been playing this game for years and years, the "new" cards every 4 months are just new jpegs of cards they took away from you and recycled.
---
Wdym by "my checklist"? Do you mean the composition of my decks?
---
alternate opinion:
---
cost to craft legendary (1600) / dust from legendary (400) = 4
---
cost to craft epic (400) / dust from epic (100) = 4
---
cost to craft rare (100) / dust from rare (20) = 5. Rares should give 25 dust, bringing the ratio to 4.
---
cost to craft common (40) / dust from common (5) = 8. Commons should cost 25 dust, bringing the ratio to 5.
---
Slightly increasing dust from rares and slashing the cost to craft commons doesn't do much to pull from Bliz's pockets, but it seriously helps F2P pauper players.
---
Otherwise, if legendary cards gave 800 dust, then dusting a single legendary is enough for 20 commons. That means a pauper player could get a complete collection after only 20 packs. The ability to dust 1 legendary for 2 epics, 8 rares, or 20 commons makes the desire to dust legendary cards too high.
---
Yes that exist since like day 1 (or discover since League of Explores) that's what I meant by: "I loved the first 3 years or so" because back then they had something new that no other TCG had, and now... It's the same "LE RANDOM CARD" and "DISCOVER" every fucking time. That's it, they've innovated about 0% over the last 2 years

Plenty of famous streamers who stream less than 8 hours a day and play multiple different games throughout their streams. Plenty of streamers and non-streamers that try much harder and put much more work/time into something and never become famous. I don't understand the point you are trying to make with being famous here.
---
I still disagree entirely. Your choice not to include combo disruption in your deck does not make a combo deck uninteractive. Every single deck can choose to tech against combo if they so choose. 
---
I do still feel that combo variants are uninteractive by design. But I feel that players do have the option to water down their deck slightly by including two or three neutral tech cards.
---
Your mech example is simply describing an archetype that provides more opportunities for interaction. One having more opportunities does not make another uninteractive, but rather less interactive.
---

wait, what? ~54% avg wr for 7 classes is too high?O.o

He can't cast it at all if I pull a single Unraveler from casting Darkest Hour.

Technically he could have ramped on 3 with Jade Blossom first, I guess - but as it so happens this game was indeed a [straight gg on t5](https://hsreplay.net/replay/Wt3Nkc5q3HPn6Xa7PYEdh6), even without pulling an Unraveler.

I'm reading thru for the first time and am on book 5. Started off slow, but it's starting to get interesting now that everyone is coming into their powers.
---
I've always enjoyed playing Thief Rogue decks and now that one is kinda-sorta viable, it's not as fun.  Mostly because you then run into a lot of other Rogues running similar decks and Rogue vs Rogue steal decks are just not fun.
---
The camera was the best part of this, but that is crazy lucky
---
I think they need to reduce the cost of legendaries to 800 and epics to 200. I’m more upset about epics
---
how on earth can you fail to see beast synergy right here?
---
"If that kills it" and **overkill** effects don't work the way you'd intuitively think they do: even though the effect requires a minion to be killed, the effect actually resolves before that minion dies. So if you kill your own minion with [[Bane of Doom]] when you have 7 minions, you won't get a random demon, because it tries to summon the demon before killing the minion. I still think this sucks, years after complaining about it.
---
I dont think so. I like the meta its some fun decks there are in the meta right now
---
They would rather create a new game mode or bring death knight class.
---
Tbh I always like to imagine games as if it were an actual battle being fought and how all that would work, so with this I’m just picturing garosh fighting valiantly against the murloc swarm before doctor boom steps in and tries to do the same but the onslaught never seems to end. Super cool visual.
---
Got outjerked again. Feels bad.
---
Simply put, I disagree.
---
While Delivery Drone does produce more cards, its only one-fifth of a card per turn on average. Even then, the seemingly constant generation of cards like Dyn-o-matic and Omega Devastator are better handled by changing those cards in particular rather than changing the Big Red Button itself. Three of the remaining four hero power options are also really rather weak generally, especially in the control match-up.
---
I can agree that allowing for both Dyn-o-matic and Omega Devastator to act as instant two-for-one trades is annoying, but that is still better left to adjustment on those cards rather than Dr. Boom, Mad Genius. Omega Assembly existing as it does as well could also use a serious adjustment.
---
Wow so I even started knee deep in it. Was around 3300 when I got there.

---

---
Bah!
---
True and false at the same time.
---
In my opinion Wotog meta was perfect you could play every archetype and win.
---
Pretty much, lol. Big Priest has become unbelievably degenerate because it turns out Catrina Muerte and Archmage Vargoth are even more broken with res effects than the previous package.
---
The strongest decks now are pretty much hyper aggressive (Murloc Shaman, Aggro Rogue) or contain degenerate synergy (Big Priest, Big Warlock).
---
You know blizzard would never do that.
---
look man my friends and I were playing and one game two fo use picked control warrior together and instaintly choose to leave that shit. Same shit in ranked game. Fatigue is a meme at this point since any class can get 10 extra turns with one dumb card.

Sometimes I had Deathwing in over Rafaam pre-RoS but I’m testing out the new boi.
---
It's  been more than a year than I spent 0 on this game.
---
And I will tell you, I fucking love Lucentbark Druid
---
Wow really? I'm at 72% vs Druid. Timber and Unleash seem to be an easy 12 damage combo in this match-up.
---
Moments before disaster
---
I think that since this set is about the league of villains led by Rafaam, it would be fitting for one of the next two expacs to he a league of heroes, and who better to lead them than Babbling Book?
---
Need 10 full mana crystals, coin is not valid
---
I think you're just overthinking here. winning is fun, as such, players want to win -&gt; strong decks have higher wr than weaker decks -&gt; players play strong decks.    
---
maybe there's some "giving in" part, but the value of winning outweighs "giving in"   
---
like, some people may work at a job where they don't particular like or are neutral towards. but the reward of doing so outweighs the working aspect.
---
Modern is more popular than standard. So no, commander is a lot less popular. Makes sense, its a fairly expensive and relatively inaccessible format that requires more people to play with.
---
PrimAtive
---
I think there are certain decks people prefer to play against. It just depends on the person. 
---
I think the current meta is more enjoyable to play against than the previous meta. There are fewer OTKs so they're more unexpected and there is less feeling of inevitability. Control and midrange decks no longer have infinite value options so even when they last long there is still a clear cost. There are fewer absurd value swings like Gul'dan or Diamond Spellstone, and they take more commitment. Aggro is a thing again and is beatable. 
---
My biggest gripe is that my favorite deck to play as (Dragon Control Priest) is rotated out and there's not a really good replacement. My favorite games of Hearthstone have been close wins or losses with that deck. Resurrect Priest can be fun and appeals to my inner Timmy, but it's just not as dynamic. There's none of that adrenaline of having to push the opponent down just a *few* more points of life before I can actually go for the kill. So if I have any problem with the current meta, it's not that I dislike the decks I'm playing against, it's that I don't really love the decks I'm playing with.
---
While I agree that it's not as fun to lose as it is to win, I disagree completely about your assessment. 
---
I remember back when Reno was meta and you had these long drawn out battles between say, Reno Mage and Reno Priest (both were controlly value decks). Say what you will about games being too long etc., but in those types of games when I lost I knew immediately why. ("Oh I need to save my entomb for THAT minion", etc.) 
---
It's all about counter play. People dont mind losing as much when they lost because they made a bad decision. When you feel like there was nothing you could have done any differently then it is extra frustrating and that's why aggro metas are the worst to some degree. Even when teched against aggro, if they draw and curve well there is no counter play whatsoever.
---
Well written, great post, would give gold if I had any left from the last time
---
You used the coin.
---
For it to be active you have to have 10 base mana,not 9 and a coin
---
The problem for the average joe is the cost of the decks. 
---
People don't like to lose, so for your non-whale (the majority) player you are limited to few decks.
---
You can't experiment because if you mess up you're stuck with a low winrate deck. If cards were cheaper you wouldn't get punished as badly for experimenting.
---
It'll still devolve into meta decks, but with more room for experimenting there will be more variety. I don't want to craft a few epics or legendaries when it'll take a few dozen packs or so to be able to afford it.
---
Wild doesn’t exist for some players.
---
The thumbnail is awesome expect the text
---
Same can be said with Hagatha + Archivist Elysiana.
---
The value isn’t infinite, but it’s big enough to have win games.
---
Aaaand the circle is complete! This post surfaces again. And thus the cycle of blame continues. I call dibs on posting it next expo!
---
My guy, this is wild...
---
Good for her. When you don't have fun playing your content will suffer sooner or later. If you're a good streamer and built up your brand (and that's certainly true for Hafu) you'll likely have enough viewers to earn your living even if you switch to another main game. Plus it's not like she's switching to a game that's much less popular than HS. She'll be fine.
---
btw: imo everything gets boring once you played a game for so many hours. I still enjoy HS a lot but there are times when I don't and I just do my daily quest for a few months before I really start playing again.
---
Do you not have eyes? Or did you just not look at the cards when you crafted them?
---
I always find it super weird that you can get whiz bang from cards
---
An upvote works too, and thanks :)
---
This is solid advice. My only addition is to not play distracted. You need to slow down, think and plan your turns.
---
i still have my 3 Cenarius that i opened
---
I don’t play bomb warrior though...
---
If you look back at all previous expansions this is the case every time. In 2 weeks rogue will dominate the meta. It’ll have a win right 5% above the rest. 
---
If it doesn’t I’ll eat the hottest pepper I can find without any water or milk for 10 minutes.
---
Day9 quitting has really bummed me out, and dampened my enthusiasm for hearthstone.
---
An example of the power of streaming is that Day9 quitting and playing MTGA on the regular has very much resulted in my own waning enthusiasm for HS, and definite interest in MTGA.  People always say Magic is super expensive, but can it really be that much more expensive than HS at this point? (serious question)
---
Well shit you got me there
---
I unfortunately don't play wild. Been wondering whether this archetype could still work in the meta without some key pieces.
---
The Reynad one was a nice twist. Bought 200 packs...on his free to play account lol.
---
Custom tournaments where the organizer selects the playable / unplayable cards would be fun
---
Then what is your excuse?
---
Sounds like a healthy matchup then?
---
It will probably happen in the update where we get more deckslots/s
---
Yup, except to stay alive you need spectral scepter, a weapon.
---
You're complaining because a deck is powerful, not because it is overpowered. You need to realise that there will always be a strongest deck, and there will always be a card in that deck that people think is "the problem" and should *obviously* be nerfed. The reality is that Mad Genius isn't actually overpowered, and is very much consistently beatable. 
---
The immediately recognisable way I know this, is because you complain about bomb warrior, not warriors as a whole: control warriors run the Boom hero too, but you don't complain about it because only bomb warrior is prominently played on ladder.
---
Exactly. I’m fine with this meta. I like Aggro and I like Control. So long as Combo is dead, Hearthstone is in a much better spot in my mind.
---
Coin coin coin. I bet no one has said it yet and I bet no one will after me.
---
Coin.
---
My regular Rafaam turns regular cards into regular legendaries and golden cards into golden legendaries, so my concern would be that it matter more whether the card being transformed was golden or not. I would ensure that golden Rafaam actually makes everything golden.
---
So you're happy that every match above rank 5 is a face race?
---
Given that MTGA isn't trying to hit the mobile market, that doesn't surprise me. I'm not sure that it says anything about the viability of the game, though. I don't think that takes away the point that MTGA is offering viable competition in the PC space.
---
&gt;Modern is more popular than standard.
---
Are you joking right now? Modern is not even close to more popular than standard. If you're talking about competitive tournaments then maybe, but I was very specific about non-tournament popularity. Modern is far below standard and commander in that regard. It's honestly ridiculous that you would try to suggest otherwise, especially when your reasoning is that commander is less popular because it's "expensive and inaccessible". Modern is far more expensive and inaccessible than both standard and commander, especially for casual play which is the vast majority of MTG play.
---
Biggest bummer
---
Cause you don't have 10 mana
---
You have 9+1
---
And yes, that's a difference.
---
Asa Akiras nerdy sister
---
it's good that they are in the game because it leads to more complex counter deck building and stuff like that.
---
it's starcraft games that end in 10-15m for example (original starcraft).
---
it's not just a way of providing more playstyles, it's a way of putting a cap or counter on people that overextend in terms of making late or long term investments.
---
otherwise the whole game would be who can make the most op late with no counterplay before then
---
Casual =/= cheap here. They may be casual, but their decks are still expensive. Because fun jank usually involves old expensive rares and mythics. And no, most are playing 500$+ decks. Of the 4 LGSs I go to, where people play commander regularly, the vast majority had decks in the 700-1300$ range. A couple had precons or slightly modified precons which were cheap (myself included). A few had really expensive decks using the duals and a bunch of real expensive old cards. ***Very*** few people had decks in the 100-200$ range, if you exclude the precons (And even with the precons, they were in a minority). And I asked around out of curiosity before. Its like that at almost all LGSs, as it just happens.
---
Blizzard? Afraid of getting sued?
---
I find it FAR more likely that they wanted the luxury of deleting the pity timer at the earliest convenience and have now done so. The world should take note. There now is zero pity.
---
The only wild deck I have is Jade Druid and I saw that coming. Absolutely disgusting.
---
Wow cool i didnt know i could play in different languages, 
---
-learns japanese
---
oh okay
---
Don't blindly dust the legendaries, maybe they will be useful cards like Zilliax. Ask here, someone will answer ya.

********
---
It's not taking me to legend anytime, but I'm having fun in the lower ranks of Wild with it.
---
&gt;Sure it might work for some people but the game is objectively bad
---
And plenty of people still play, enjoy, and defend it. Make an actual post/submission saying this stuff, saying the game is objectively bad, and watch how badly you get shit on. You can tell me it's just a circlejerk, but in my opinion it would indicate that perhaps you're not necessarily in the right.
---
You've just explained why I hate control as the point of those decks is to just stop everything until they run out of resources. It isn't for some cool combo. It is literally. I'm hero to stall you out. The less stuff on board, the happier a control deck is.
---
Jade isn t control though, it was a ramp deck.
---
I don't care. racists gonna racist. scum.
---
What's a good winrate?  The control warrior deck I'm playing right now has a 59% winrate so far with like 40 games played.  Is that worth climbing with or would I want to look for a higher winrate?
---
starkos89#1330 NA Challenge a Friend trade
---
Right there with you. I’m 100% positive I could get to rank 5 or so, but I have a hard enough time devoting the time just to get to rank 10, so I’m usually between there and 15. 
---
And I prefer slow decks which are horrible to ladder with. I can climb pretty decently with zoolock but I just get bored too quickly. Rafaam can at least make those games a little more interesting though but then it can turn into an RNG clown fiesta (until you get Talanji and then wait a couple minutes to see “Your opponent has left”).
---
Also, the classic sudden-death card [[Holy Wrath]] is known for using the non-modified cost.
---
Game froze.  At this point you lost to dc, DC, if got close and reopen when it happens you can usually make it back in
---
Becomes meta after legendary weapons rotate.  Classic.
---
They pretty much straight up took a sledgehammer to Heroes's knees and elbows, and proceeded to leave it in the back yard with a supply of bread and water. There's basically no Blizzard support beyond the basics, and anyone still in it is in it because they love the game itself for all its faults.
---
Fair enough sadly control and F2P usually don’t go together unless you’re optimally using your gold

---
5/-/- | Draw a card and deal damage equal to its Cost.  
---
Again, that may be true where you're at, but it's pretty much the exact opposite in many places. Personally, I ended up buying some precons just so I had something more fair to play with people in my area because even my favorite, a non-competitive Maelstrom Wanderer deck, is too powerful for them.
---
3-3 for 3 is perfectly average minion so you don't even lose much tempo. Plus it will have Rush later on so it becomes psuedo-removal. 
---
Bomb warrior is just play cards and shuffle in lethal damage. Really not a fun or interactive experience for me. Sure, they have to "manage resources", "calculate when to clear" but that's any control deck ever so it's not like you do anything special for it. 
---
What do I do vs bombs? Myra's? It doesn't help that warrior has one of the two hero cards which exacerbates the problem as they have a distinct advantage over other classes. 
---
Honestly, just seeing so many bomb warriors has distinctly soured me on this expansion so far.
---
I'm shocked he hasn't been HOF'd yet
---
a) “[making] multiple decks viable for ladder variation” is not a simple science. See point 7 of [Magic’s “When Cards Go Bad” article.](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/when-cards-go-bad-2002-01-28) Constant changes to cards under test combined with the simple ability to overestimate or underestimate cards/decks means it’s difficult to control exactly how many decks will be “viable” a year in advance.
---
b) Part of the problem is external to the HS devs and totally uncontrollable - third parties like VS and HSReplays can gather enough data to calculate “meta scores” for every deck down to the hundredth of a percent, and players will mostly gravitate toward the highest win rate decks even when they only win half a percent more often. Nobody can really do anything about this, unless you can somehow convince thousands of players that a deck can be ladder viable when its win rate is only in the 49-51% band.
---
I was talking about being famous with hearthstone.
---
Yes some people are gifted. That has nothing to do with what I just said. If you want to be great at anything you have to push yourself to put time in it even when it sucks and keep going. That is literally for anything. That is in fact why you’re an unknown.
---
Except bomb warrior isn't grindy and doesnt take too long to win... the other decks are just getting lucky with an early combo. Bomb sucker is just... face rolling the screen to play whatever mana cost card you're up to.  It takes nothing to just plant shit in someone's deck. But whatever. Call it whatever but it's simply not fun to play against and you shouldnt have to tailor a fucking deck around just dealing with ducking bombs.
---
right? classic blizzturd card design.
---
I just wanna say, dumpster rank Wild is mostly people playing meme decks.  I had someone yesterday at rank 19 who, bless their heart, was playing a full-on Bwonsamdi deck, with everything you could think of to go in it.  Kel Thuzad and co.
---
Well, that and people playing old Standard decks.  I have yet to run into a Big Priest, at my rank.
---
I dunno if I prefer Himom for Highmane or Dirty Sanchez the Spell Wizard for Antonidas.
---
I see what you're saying about the lack of innovation. We'll see what happens with these new titles they're boasting but I'm not super hopeful. You're right though, Blizzard has become too "coorporate" and it isn't that studio that "just makes great games" anymore (not to say their games aren't great)
---
Oh hi mane
---
fel rraver is the closes we got
---
Also I noticed you chose all aggro decks which isn’t a coincidence: even if it has the same winrate as a late game deck it ladders faster since the games are shorter
---
This meta just feels like token druid and control warriors though.
---
&gt; They could do that tomorrow and it wouldn't affect anything.
---
fragments existing player base into smaller pools of players.
---
I know a lot of people that play MTG. Ive asked around a lot. Its the situation almost everywhere. Im afraid you are the exception to the rule here.
---
Also fast on the sense that you win or lose by turn 5 so laddering is quicker
---
I guess but I feel like some metas bring on more complaints than others.
---
Mulkas big brother is from the tutorial
---
That average is heavily skewed by infancy deaths.
---
Sure, I can see Face collector as a potential option, but I think Edwin has stronger potentual than Face collector. In any case, NEVER get shark
---
Uncollectable card from the tutorial match that you can't summon with the arch mage
---
All the OTK decks are really what made me quit. There's virtually nothing you can do (with a few small exceptions that mostly require RNG) to counter your opponent's plan.
---
What's ridiculous about it is that you often get this card as one of the cards. So even when they clear the board you just put another one down and repeat. 
---
Then you get 2 more and it just becomes impossible to clear.
---
Why should the game drag to turn 10? This is part of the game, if you dont enjoy it, go play other game, like yugioh where turn 1 kill is normal, or mtg where turn 5 kill is perfectly possible too... oh wait.
---
I fucked up and magnetized the wrong minion today because i queued all my attacks and a minion died right as i let go of the card lol
---
problem is these requests are around for a hell of a long time. it is a digital game.  these patches should have been years ago when there was traction, not delayed 5 years because they don't want to change things too quickly.  the current team or business strategy is moving too slow for hearthstone.  balancing patches as well just come out too slow and not frequent enough to compete in the digital card game market, to me.
---
I hate to break it to you but I wouldn’t consider any of the current meta decks hyper aggro. Best example is our current pirate rogue vs MSoG pirate warrior or our current token Druid vs JUG token Druid. Hyper aggro is losing on turn 5 even with good anti aggro like early taunt, doomsayer, and ooze. These decks just feel hyper aggro because we currently have no super effective anti aggro cards we used to have and the ones we still do have would result in a lower win rate vs control decks. So now it’s just up to your deck building skill how many cards will you put in to combat aggro and how many cards will you put in to combat control. You’ll never get 100% wr, you just need more than 50%, just figure out what combination of cards does that.
---
&gt;when Blizzard isn't innovating anywhere and seems to be under the impression that they can just drop the same exact type of content over and over again on the same release schedule and keep going forever.
---
Because people are still buying it! I post this in thread after thread but holy shit, no-one in ANY of the subreddits for the games you mentioned wants to address the fact that players on the subreddits unironically go "Eh the game is fine I don't need any more changes" and then keep paying money.
---
I don't get how people can seriously keep complaining, while simultaneously DEFENDING these people who are making their voices heard even more effectively by actually spending money. And yes, there are a good amount of these people, given how I see people who say "I spend $150 a year on Hearthstone and I get so much hourly value out of the dollars I spend that it's more worth it than any other game :)))" get, y'know, 30+ upvotes on this sub alone. I'm not saying people can't or shouldn't think/pay what they want. 
---
Just that if you (You reading this, not just the person I'm replying to) want things to change at a faster rate, maybe you should consider looking at the people posting the same place as you who say the game doesn't need changes when you think it does? Because your comments aren't "just opinions". Many people here post thinking that Team 5 sees their issues. But that also means they see the people thinking the game is fine. But is that okay with you? That someone just flat-out says "No you're wrong the game DOESN'T need additional features it's fine you're just entitled"?
---
The deck is very highroll dependent. In my experience there is 2 types of this deck. The premade one that consists of 29 Murloc sand bloodlust. And the more refined one that consists of about 17-20 Murlocs, hagstha, thunderhead, zaps, bloodlust, and lightning. 
---
The only Murloc one loses about 80% of the time because it loses steam if you don’t draw the underbelly. 
---
The hagatha one has a lot more help in that it’s not completely over if you lose board control. That being said both of these decks have trouble dealing with big taunt minions/ decks that have some form of early board control. (I played a Murloc shaman with my mage deck that I have a spirit of the dragon hawk in and on turn 3 he has underbelly, warleader, and Murloc scout. I played spirit the previous turn and then daring fire eater hero powerd his board and he instant quit because he knew he’d lost board control.)
---
The key to these Murloc decks is that you either 1 highroll underbelly in your opening hand or 2 your opponent gets a shit starting hand and can’t even play anything for 3/4 turns.
---
The deck is easily counterable with every class except maybe priest because most of their low cost aoe is gone. 
---
Warrior? Warpath/turn 5 brawl, whirlwind, armor, mechs
---
Shaman? 2-3 damage to all enemy minions(can’t remember name), hagathas scheme on turn 5, hex for the war leader/underbelly, feral spirit for board control
---
Warlock? Hellfire, mortal coil (for single murlocs), the deal 2 damage to all minions and discard your lowest cost card, 1/3 taunt
---
Mage? Spirit of the dragon hawk, mountain giant, shooting star, hero power, arcane explosion
---
Rogue? Fan of knives, backstab, weapons, lackeys, vendetta, south sea deckhand, prep vanish, sap
---
Paladin? Secrets, consecration, pyro, hero power, weapons, heals
---
Hunter? Secrets, weapons, lynx
---
Druid? Heropower, swipe, taking boardcontrol with tokens
---
As for neutral cards that can help:
---
The beast that destroys Murlocs, pyromancer, taunts, silence, boar, 3/6 battle cray deal 1 damage to all minions (can’t remember name), plenty of others
---
The decks not insanely good your could just have bad draws when your play them/they could have perfect draws against you
---
I'm an old player and have made a ton of decks from scratch. If you're at Rank 5, you're just pitted against everyone using optimized competitive decks. It's fun when you pull off what your deck is meant to do, but that's rare. Going to Casual is even worse because you're going against people who barely have any cards sometimes.
---
&gt;Unfortunately so far, I don't believe they've given other decks/classes enough tools to deal with the amount of control that exists in the best decks.
---
Wat? It's control that needs the tools, not the other way around. Look at all the tier one decks right now. They are all heavily minion based with a low mana curve. 
---
The only "tool" you need is to spam the board over and over with minions. Just play 30 games of token druid or zoolock and you will beat control more often than you lose.
---
Does the "Legendary in 10 packs" apply to sets in Wild also or only sets that are currently in standard?
---
Even then, that treasure that fills your hand is better than draw 3.
---
Ya. Combo with Dire Frenzy and Tundra Rhino for tier 1 deck.
---
Battlecry: you shouldn't have played Edwin
---
I dont do combo decks so ill never use him
---
I'd still rather play the most true Hunter legendary we have, Lord Highmane
---
Troll harder
---
It took me way too long to realize that I was not Team 5's target customer which is ultimately why I quit Hearthstone (still lurk). There were so many early signs that I missed that would've prevented a lot of disappointment in regards to the direction of the game;
---
* going mobile (bigger player-base at the cost of tech debt - possibly one of the reasons why they don't add new features/game modes)
---
* unwilling to change the UI because it would be "confusing" for returning players (the whole deck-slot incident)
---
* similar to the last point, they don't want to buff/nerf cards because it would be inconvenient for returning players to actually read the god damn cards they are playing
---
* high variance RNG cards (I'm okay with low variance RNG but stuff like Barnes takes the fun out of the game for me)
---
It was SO hard to quit due to the sunken-cost fallacy but now that I haven't played in 4 months, I feel no desire to go back to Hearthstone unless their entire philosophy on the game changed. I'd highly recommend for everyone to consider if they are still having fun and they like the direction of the game; if you are only sticking around because you've spent lots of time/money on the game, you mighty be a lot happier if you quit Hearthstone.
---
You Fuul, you dare challenge [[The Gruul]]?
---
people just want to be able to play janky homebrew decks with the same success as t1 decks... like the t1 decks from EVERY meta feel oppressive to play against.  and tbh I'd rather play vs bomb warrior than pirate warrior, although i pretty much hate whenever control warrior is good in a meta..

8/7/7 | At the end of each turn, gain +1/+1 .  
---
you're missing my point
---
He's right tho
---
Risking not using it is flirting with catching double Leeroy to the face tho. Still great to use on an empty board imo for most situations
---
&gt;Plenty of other games do this just fine
---
Serious question: do they? Which games are you thinking of? I can't think of any games where I can lose five in a row and think "this was a fun way to spend my time", and I'm not even as hypercompetitive as a lot of people. I play a lot of meme wild decks in casual, but getting wrecked repeatedly sucks in every game.
---
Would ask if you got an invite straight after, but as it was a friendly match it’s doubtful!
---
Someone arrest this man! He's telling the truth!
---
Yes, big priest cant do shit like this (it can, but requires the opponent to not do anything untill turn 5, and to draw the nuts and get lucky barnes pulls), but this deck can do it better and more consistently. People will complain about big priest cheating a big minion and ressing it once or even twice on turn 5, but thats just 1-2 minions and turn 5 **in the best draw possible**, this is way too many minions, turn 5 or even before, and some of them have charge so they do damage inmediately, others block your spells. The best draw possible is comboing turn 2 going second for 4 big minions...
---
I dont know if we will discover new decks that can counter darkest hour in wild, normally with all the interaction we have its not hard to make counter decks, but if we fail to do so, even if the deck is just tier 2 (like big priest), its matchups will be pretty polarizing, a la star aligner druid, and that can guarrant a nerf.
---
&gt; +1/+1 from boulderfist is all it takes for you?
---
+1/+1 is all the benefit Keleseth needs to give your minions for them to become overwhelming. Nerfing cards by a single point of either attack *or* health is frequently all you need to make them unplayable. +1/+1 is a lot.
---
&gt; Ok, how about a 6/7/7 or a 6/6/8?
---
...no, because those aren't enough stats to justify it. That's really your argument? "Oh, you think this card is playable purely because of raw stats? Well what if I *reduced* those stats, suddenly not so playable now, *huh*?!?!"
---
You sent the same reply like half an hour apart. Weird.
---
Oh, I agree, I was just asking if that was it or if I forgot an 8/8
---
\&gt;I have 8k dust, probably I'll craft what is missing for the zoolock deck to get those monthly rank chest. So for cards like that "1 mana buy 3 cards then discard them", which are from boomsay or before, there is almost no risk I will open them in packs after crafting if I only play arena right?  
---
That's correct. If you craft a legendary or own it, then you can't get it again in packs unless you own all the lengendaries.
---
I think they're talking about reno priest even though that came a year later. Or arcane golem faceless finisher combos.
---
TWO Unsleeping Souls?? What are the odds??
---
 Swiecor#2941 trading 80g EU I'll show, you go first
---
I will easily wipe you out with The 🅱️Ancient One
---
Holy fire and holy nova are bad cards, i would replace them with the 5 mana aoe from LOE and add somemore big minons (lich king, ragnaros).
---
I would also swap binding heal with spirit lash.
---
Was my favourite deck, I still want to make him work in a deck.
---
I dusted my free DK from the lich king adventure in the past, I was new into the game and don't understand sht
---
Patron warrior was an OTK deck that required no board control, even worse than the Worgen one. Unless you're referring to the deck after warsong nerf.
---
it depends on the situation and on the deck you use and in which environment you are using it
---
in a aggro deck the 12/12 would be better
---
in a midrange deck the dr
---
in a meta where a lot of singletargetremovale is played the 12/12 would be bad
---
in a meta where a lot of silence is used the dr would be bad
---
at the end, probably both would be played
---
Was it ever played? Seems pretty garbage even for druid.
---
I'm with you 100%; thief priest mirror is the best matchup.
---
Razacus could easily take games against aggro with cleats/Reno without ever seeing any of the cards you mentioned. It was more of a control deck with different answers and win-cons depending on the matchup, with that pseudo-combo built in for long games.
---
I don't play Magic so could you give me some examples of games modes the players have made? I'm not really sure what that would look like for Hearthstone if we had physical cards and could do what we wanted.
---
&gt; up from a specific point rawstats are better
---
The opposite hold true due to hard removal
---
Would a 30/30 Ancient One be better, or a 15/15 that makes a 15/15 on death?
---
But games never went to fatigue with Jade Druid unless you played it wrong. There wasn't UI so you couldn't cycle through your entire deck. You always got 10/10's before you hit fatigue so you won control matchups before then.
---
Bad players thought that the reason Jade Druid was oppressive was the fatigue counter when that was never really an issue. Fatigue decks weren't a thing at the time unless you played weird fatigue jank at rank 20.
---
I like to run \[\[Barysta Linchen\]\] with togg, sometimes it's really worth it, others i can copy some lackey, SI7 or something and sort of refill my hand if needed
---
At this point, I would prefer a Peasant or Pauper mode over a tournament mode. Anything to spark some creativity.

5/4/5 | Battlecry: Add a copy of each of your other Battlecry minions to your hand.  
---
Should be two weeks after expansion launch, like the solo content before it
---
It's like 1/135 * 1/135 man wow
---
Thank you. People have no clue what control or midrange or aggro is.
---
Honestly as a tech card ooze is super strong. It’s a 2-drop with vanilla stats that outright destroys a weapon, usually tech cards have some sort of downside (ie eater of secrets as a 4 mana 2/4) but ooze has none, of weapons are meta you just throw ooze in your deck without a second thought.
---
Big Bad Archmage was so good for me in arena
---
Nagyon erős! És csak 6 mana?
---
And a mysterious blade that carda is soooooo rare
---
Typical well played
---
 I was going to reply when I saw this beat me to it lmfao
---
Combo renolock was a thing also (leeroy/PO/faceless) in the early days of renolock.
---
It's because the devs say he opens up many archetypes
---
I was legit thinking this cause I like golden tech cards but turns out you get it by hitting level 58 rogue!!! So hop to it with the rogue grind!
---
You forgot Rogue, where it was run a lot, but destroying it was almost irrelevant.
---
Sure, it's definitely context sensitive. I just think that most metagames would see Highmane maxxed before a single card with similar stats to the combined nature of Highmane. You could very well also just see a Hunter with 4 six drops including two of this.
---
In all likelihood though this card would not see play and that's pretty interesting to consider since it looks broken.
---
Treantposters unite.
---
yeah, sorry it wasn't really well expressed, at the start of the game u choose 5 cards to add 2 copies of each at the bottom of your deck? what u think?
---
But the context here is specifically referring to the Gadgetzan Meta, not Reno decks in general. Typically Reno decks were pure control due to the survivability the card offered, but Raza Priest’s namesake was the benefit that Raza gave the Anduin DK, so Reno was really just a minor player in that deck’s power.
---
Use gold for arena and dont stink. I've always had more than enough dust for good decks.
---
It's still in standard m8
---
Well I feel like if it was in standard today, people would play it. 3 mana hard removal with a drawback isn't too bad if you need it. But back then they had access to Naturalize for 2 cheaper and the drawback isn't nearly as bad. In some ways Naturalize's drawback was a good thing.
---
To be honest 'Fun to play against' in the scenario of a competitive video game always just sounded like 'It's shit'
---
There are also people who defend goat fucking, does it make it ok?
---
you are definitly true in this point
---
but i think that is the problem of hunter not having enough carddraw for this
---
i think in zoo it would be ok not great but playable
---
Maybe craft \[\[Whizbang\]\] so you can play different stuff while the meta takes form
---
To your first point I completely agree IF we are talking about low cost cards. High cost cards? +1/+1 is meh who cares. The difference between a 10/10 and an 11/11 is meh. The difference between a 2/3 and a 3/4 is everything. It is a huge huge difference and we can't just lump it into one rule that +1/+1 is always a big deal.  
---
As for your second point I am just trying to gauge what the point is in which you think it is enough stats to justify running in a deck. A 6/6/7 doesn't see play, it doesn't even get considered. Suddenly you are saying a 6/7/8 definitely sees play. My question is is there anything in between the 6/6/7 and the 7/7/8 which you would still consider playing? Personally I wouldn't even consider the 6/7/8 either. This is the whole point of the discussion: "how overstatted does a high cost vanilla minion have to be to see play in constructed?" So, for you apparently it is just +1/+1. That's your opinion, that's fine. I disagree, that is also fine. Don't get so defensive haha, we are just talking.
---
thanks for guiding us
---
Guy had a board full of murlocs and the spell that transforms them all into legendaries. I could kill all but 1. With him having 3 cards in hand I thought itd be a safe bet to let the weakest live, the murloc legendary that makes murlocs cost 1. Turns out he had 2 murlocs in his hand, one of which being the one up for discussion. I lost that match.
---
Did someone say bomb, ah ha!
---
(tom cruise gif here)
---
Wait...  Wha...     what?
---
The thing is the death knights were not balanced. I had two of the strongest one , the priest and warlock one, but lacked the support cards. Like if the warlock one were to be in this current meta, I don't think it would be crazy. The main problem there was the cubes that created that value engine for that swing turn. With the priest one, it was about running a lot of cheap thing with your control deck. The warrior and shaman one felt fair. So now that blizzard wants to move away from infinite value they haven't dealt with the cards they already created. Maybe make new cards for warrior not a mech, sure it fit well, but is that synegry is too much.
---
Here is the real answer.
---
&gt;I swear, if you run Mossy Horror you’ll be just fine.
---
I don't know - I've been playing control shaman, and even when running mossys and *all* the boardclears I'm still often not able to deal with their wisps+soul turns.  The issue is that you need **two** clears: one for the wisps and one for the treants.  Just mossy on its own is no good (it makes their boar *stronger*), so you need exactly mossy/hagatha's scheme + lightning storm (or potentially 2 schemes), otherwise you just get double roared down.  And often they can refill their boards more times than you can clear it, so keeping **two** clears can be hard.
---
Pyro might be a good call though - may try swapping out a doomsayer for it.
---
Maybe, but at that point there's no reason for every to slot it in.
---
Any combo deck can win againt aggro just by stabilicing. Toggagle druid coul win after the second spreading plague, no need to do the combo. That doesnt mean its not a combo deck.
---
There was no other wincon appart from raza+anduin+velen. There simply just wasnt. Against aggro they can win by stabilicing with the hero power, but against all the rest of the meta they ahd to win trough the combo. Beating an afk opponent with a 3/3 or 5/5 hitting face doesnt make it an "alternative wincondition", the wincondition was raza + anduin and the rest of the deck was as much stall and cicle as the deck could get.
---
This Minion is so buggy
---
I prefer when things are properly put into a museum.  Unfortunately, most of them will only have 1 charge left on them.  You don't get the Jaraxxus/Doomhammer value that you did in vanilla.
---
r/woooosh
---
I think the issue is the Dragons are considering such core cards of the Classic set. They recently even started giving them away as a part of the beginner's welcome bundle. So they would almost definitely have to treat it differently than they do other HOF cards. They might just nerf it, say, to +4 spell damage or something.
---
it wouldn't be broken, eccentric scribe is better.
---
As for zoo I think you could consuder it though in my personal experience cards that cost this much have to deal burst damage to see play. I will say this is a good target for Defender of Argus.
---
I meant recycle. It costs 6 mana and delays fatigue.
---
What was the original comment? Dude was too much of a coward to keep his comment up.
---
You are not wrong, but this sub is nothing but complaining.  It is nice to have some balance.  I don't consider this post false equivalence, I consider it rare balance.
---
It's like odd pally all over again, but with better buffs.
---
**cast when drawn** spells cast themselves; lorewalker cho gives spells *you* cast to your opponent (and vice versa). Since you're not the one casting, cho does nothing.

Look, I know you think you have a point you are trying to get across when you say things like that, but I just want to let you know how sanctimonious and toxic you come across when you say things like "have bigger problems."

You're not a psychologist, you're not a professional, you're a dude on the internet, just like the rest of it.  Instead of belittling people and trying to be condescending or judgmental of their feelings, why not try to bring something positive to the conversation?

Token druid, mech hunter, control warrior, mage with conjurer's calling.
---
Remember how Patches now screams YAHAR?
---
Its the best thing ever, especially after how Thijs made jokes about it
---
Learned that the hard way. Started booms day expansion, thought bomb hunter looked dope. Well it sucked, so made a meta deathrattle hunter, and made it to rank 2.
---
I only watched her play Hearthstone a few times, she always looked bored so no surprise. I need to clean my followed list anyway.
---
But then they could be targeted by a Toki -&gt; Hemet if the opponent got it. I think OP's play here was correct.
---
I played a pretty cool Dragon Soul deck that used as test subject spell engine with seance to let you cast a bunch of spells every turn to generate a board full of 5/5's. This combo could also heal you to full every turn in case you don't draw dragon soul. Slide in an Amara from the quest and you could play an 8/8 Amara every other turn while stalling for dragon soul.
---
Sunreaver Warmage doesn't trigger if spells are reduced by Kalecgos.
---
Speak for yourself. I like to lose because *I'm good at it*. I've been having tons of fun losing to various things.
---
Aggro is pretty popular right now, but it's not unbeatable. The major problem with aggro being so strong is control decks being far too greedy and getting punished for it. That's aggro's purpose, to keep decks from being too greedy.
---
Rise of Shadows is great! Standard meta hasn't been so good in literal years. If the meta is too aggro, then you adapt. Hell, the reason why we have so many aggro decks is that people needed to find a way to kill bomb warrior before they died to Blastmaster Boom.
---
Sure there are a few troubling card interactions in standard but this is so much better without KFT and K&amp;C super value cards.
---
I then went on to rank down to no stars on rank 15 as the New expansion dropped :P
---
Togwaggle doesn’t win without combo, your 3 remaining 1/5’s from your second plague are not going to beat down a 30hp hunter, and the deck usually doesn’t run any other minions besides ironbarks. People may concede after the second plague, but only because they know the combo is inevitably coming. 
---
Razacus by comparison has a much greater variety in win conditions, with Reno, a good Emperor, or clears into any decent-tempo follow up all taking games off of various archetypes.
---
I do hope they ban her in tournaments or the games will be total snoozefests. Especially when we have the specialist format and everyone decides to bring Elysiana double/banker as their Tertiary.
---
what the hell are you trying to say
---
...how is a 6-mana 7/8 worse than Eccentric Scribe? And don't say "Eccentric Scribe is a 6-mana 10/8!" because no, it's not. Eccentric Scribe is a 6-drop that's first half dies to a lot of 3-drops and whose second half dies to literally any AoE ever. And is silenceable.
---
A 6-mana 7/8 would be an all-star bomb in Arena, and totally playable in Standard constructed following a new rotation when card quality is low. Like, y'know, the one we just had. A 6-mana *10/10* would be played in practically every deck ever made.
---
Dies to Hemet. Literally unplayable.
---
It's an awful play, depending on what minions he has left in his deck.
---
Yep same...I’ve won a bunch of games because of the double leges.  Usually insane value, especially when you can play it same turn.
---
that would actually be horrible for this build. the idea of this deck is to get Catrina asap and make her multiply
---
I was at 22k dust at expac start, crafted what I needed for BW and that brought me down to 14k.  I'm still riding kind of high off of when Old Gods was out and this was basically the only thing I played at work during downtime, so I had a LOT saved up from spamming arena runs.  
---
But I've been trying to keep the decks I make to about 1-2 per expansion at most.  Kinda regret BW now, I always liked playing the slow controlley warrior game, but it's not been much fun really, Boom giving a bad hero power 10 turns in a row also doesn't help my outlook lol.
---
Tournament Ban should equate to deleting the card then.
---
The meta still needs a week or two to shake out and see if anything is actually too powerful. Meanwhile, please don't trivialize other people's concerns. Even if x deck isn't super OP, it can still be strong enough to impact enjoyment in a very negative way.
---
In RR Hunter decks were flat-out the best (after the initial 2-week Druidstone repeat from Boomsday).  Then the second round of nerfs happened, and Hunter was still clearly the best (most-played *and* highest winrate) only now there were fewer Hunter decks to choose from.
---
The first post-nerf RKR meta was alright, pretty combo-heavy but that's okay sometimes.  The second post-nerf meta was like the first one but more boring and odds are your deck got nerfed.
---
due to how many aggro decks i had to face after rank 10 i had no other choice  but to have as many heal spells as possible
---
Do you have Boommaster Flark by any chance? There's a bomb mech hunter that uses him instead.
---
haha love it! hate playing against it, but love the meme
---
Why is it not a Beast? He is his Brother means for me that their parents should be beasts and the brother should be a beast.
---
Server disconnect.
---
I would LOVE a singleton commander format in hearthstone with like 50 card decks. Just make the commander go back to your hand like the Rogue DK card if you haven’t played it
---
ugh whats the secret? I think my max is 5
---
Help
---
Is the poll thread about whether people would play it serious, or is a joke? It seems like it should be a joke, but the comparisons to sea giant and mountain giant have got me shook, I could be convinced that "cheap big dude" isn't actually viable

---
The worst part is that some tavern brawls are awesome but are gone in a week. Would be cool if we could play custom rule games even if it was just with friends
---
I'm glad I didn't buy any packs with money, 1 week in and I'm already bored. I'm bad at the game usually siting between 15-10 on ladder with my homebrew meme garbage, playing against the same meta decks, casual is even worse for me, same 3 decks every time I queue. Wild is no option for me and I don't really have interest, arena for a bad player like me is wasted gold..nothing to keep me playing or engaged besides the onetime singleplayer content. Curious how the meta shapes but nothing to make me stick around
---
Calling Reno a minor player is laughable. Reno was the primary win condition against anything aggressive (arguably &gt;50% of matchups, depending on your pocket meta)
---
good job. you graduated from butthurt child to normal person. 
---
now lets just get the other 100 million people playing to follow suit and we'll have a decent community,
---
I quit a few months ago, thought about trying the new expansion but discovered I no longer got a free legendary or free packs and decided it wasn't worth it.  What hearthstone has become is not what I imagined so I have decided to move on after 5 years.
---
Part of the fun of card games is to do exactly what I described. Would you rather Blizzard just give us 10 decks to buy and only ever use those? That would be the definition of a stagnant meta. 
---
What tools are we not given? What do you mean by create and test the cards? Are you suggesting some sort of wikipedia style card game where everyone just creates what they want? Blizzard designs cards that interact with each other in a multitude of combinations and ways and it is our task to find out how to use these tools and counter each others creations.
---
yeah, I've only had it since the latest patch when I switch apps or something. it used to bring me back in no problem, but now it just gets stuck like that. - would love to know a fix if anyone has one
---
Academic espionage flavor text has overkill.
---
Play a lot, and if you really want to win, use a deck drafter helper online or download a helper
---
you start to talk louder.
---
Look man, jade druid is and has always been midrange. It's the definition of a midrange deck. It aims to curve out and overpower other decks with big minions and high tempo plays. It can take the game long as which makes it a grindy midrange deck. 
---
Your definition of control would include GvG midrange paladin, classic midrange shaman and any midrange deck that takes the game past T8. That's still midrange.
---
Burgle rogue is still bad, tempo rogue is the nuts and it doesn’t even run any of the cards in some builds
---
There are certain decks that just feel bad to lose against. Freeze mage/Quest mage used to always be that type of deck for me. It felt like they either got the cards they needed in time to win or they didn't and lost. A lot of combo decks end up being kind of similar to that, but with mage in particular, there was a lot of aoe/stall cards to make the game feel less interactive.
---
This subreddit has a lot of people, and those people find different deck types/matchups to be annoying. There are people who enjoy playing the decks that I hate and love having them in the meta. On the other hand, Deathstalker Rexxar had been one of my favorite cards since its release, so I didn't particularly mind when Hunter was popular. When a post shows up on the front page complaining about a deck, it just means that some people don't like it, not that everyone hates it.
---
Even as aggro, this shouldn't be an issue, as long as you remember to always kill the mountain giant. If you can't kill the mountain giant, you're screwed already.
---
Man, stay off the internet if in-game emotes are affecting you this much.
---
Im glad they pushed it. Its a very fun archaetype that isn't overpowered. Sometimes they have cheesy wins like discover a Hero card (transform into Hagatha, Dr Boom)... but the other times, they'll get useless cards too especially when playing against warlock
---
In an ideal situation I can do the following.
---
1. Start out with any relatively reasonable archetype.
---
2. Tech my deck extremely heavily against one specific matchup, at the expense of all my other matchups.
---
3. Pretty much autowin the 1 matchup I teched against (my overall winrate will be bad, though, due to losing to everything else).  The only time this won't work is when my opponent has also ridiculously teched all-in against me.
---
Views and drama.
---
Thanks!
---
I thought we was gonna go on a rant about BB afterwards. Guess not. lol
---
u have no idea the shit this vomit is giving me-my opponetnts always draw/top deck the BEST answer ALWAYS,the RNG fk s me all the time/1 shit example -iam playing priest and iam facing warr,i am using thought steal for example-the result is double shield slam and this is every single time when rng decides who rolls higher-they alywas roll higher than me its prettu annoying!!
---
Yeah not sure what you're getting at here either.

How about Big Bad Archmage plus 2 coins to summon Gruul, the Golden God of Hearthstone? This way you instawin and don't even have to go face.
---
&gt;Blizzard should put out new game modes to increase variety,
---
agreed. but we've all been saying that for years and nothing's come of it. so if we choose to continue to play this game we need deck building in standard fixed
---
Its cause they got an xbox UI designer to work on sc2 for their new battle.net 2.0. Instead of working to add on to the great stuff they had in wc3, they worked backwards and stripped everything that gave wc3 its charm.
---
Losing is fine if the deck your playing against is actually fun to play against.
---
There is nothing fun whatsoever for the other player that at any point their opponent might just win by simply ending their turn and you draw 6 (or enough bombs to kill you) bombs in a row.
---
A lot of games feel like you're not doing anything useful. You just have to rely on really really dumb luck to win the game let alone enjoy it.

---
Its like a death knight Whizbang.
---
I'm surprised most of these streamers continue to play 8 hours a day in a game where there is nothing new other than card releases every 4 months.  The game itself is just stale and Blizzard knows this which is why they reached out during the AMA last month to find out ideas on what to focus on.  It's funny how they all just disappear after the release of the expansion however.
---
Dies to BGH, 0/10.

"Death is close" is one of it's effects when C'Thun gets buffed tho
---
And now those same people are doing the same with AutoChess. Though I do  think theres some good you could gleam off of AutoChess that might be why some people are addicted to playing it that HS lost.
---
As someone who only plays Thief Rogue or Espionage Rogue, I instantly concede when it hits my Spectral Cutlass. I wish other weapon decks weren't so popular atm :(
---
Kaq i fortë, dhe vetëm 6 mana?
---
Hmmm, I think legendaries are fine. THey are unique and interesting. The fact that you can only play one is this idea that you can only use this once and then that's it, so you need to use your legendaries wisely.
---
I honestly am starting to think the problem is Discover (to an extent). It allows someone to go outside of what hearthstone allows - 30 cards with only 1 copy of any legendary they run.

I love discover, but I think the devs need to be more conservative with what kind of discovers they release. For instance, discovering a spell can be huge. Kalecgos does it, and that is unique, it is a legendary. I think it is fine that it is powerful. But the new Rogue pirate card is infuriating. You are discovering a spell from another class! On top of that you can select the best one, the one that will impact the board. Unlike Kalecgos, you can play around it because you know the spell is mage, and if they play it immediately well that is just Kalecgos' power. But the rogue pirate there is no way to even remotely play around that, so when they get a really good spell you just feel cheated.

70% of any dust earned above 100K seems more realistic.
---
I forget where I heard this, but "the longer the breakup speech, the sooner they'll be coming back"
---
I gotta give credit where it's due to streamers like Savjz who said they're gonna quit HS in like a tweet, and then just dipped. As opposed to streamers who built their entire career off of one videogame and then is shocked when they have to build their community from the ground up when they play something else
---
I wouldn’t recommend it as it gives diminishing returns every rotation. Additionally you may want to jump into Wild six months from now.
---
Ahh um homem de cultura
---
I think part of the problem is that monetization of the game is so tied to card collecting. The fact that they don't have paid skins/cardbacks/other cosmetics means that they can't reduce the cost of card packs or increase dust refunds in a meaningful way without dropping revenue for the game.
---
But his image has to be a meme
---
Not back when Face Hunter/Old zoo with PO was around. You play this on 6 in that meta and you basically just conceded.
---
In no world is savannah better than an unconditional 6 mana 10/10. Like, i don't even. This sub, man. One day some will unironically praise silverback as a good card. I've seen many users in here come close and get tens of upvotes.
---
Also, I think the low level of emote is what leads to this toxicity.  I played mtgo, people could plainly chat with each other.  Very little toxicity.  Admins wouldn't tolerate it if it existed either.
---
These extremes are only your assumption (and a confirmation bias most likely as well). Reality is much different. Most of the matchups may have a clear favourite but will be no where near being polarized. If you just look at statistics from any metastats website you'll see there aren't too many 80-20 or something matchups. The fact that for some of decks such matchups exists is still fine. 
---
There was a time where Freeze Mage and Control Warrior existed in one meta each of the decks had it's good and bad matchups, and some autowin/autolose ones as well. These two had especially polarized matchup against each other, but that wasn't ever a problem.
---
if you think blizzard is doing a good job with deck options in standard then we'll just have to agree to disagree. the fact is the game is hemorrhaging players and the number one reason given is because of how stale standard feels, even after a new expansion
---
if you're good with playing slightly different versions of zoolock, token druid, control warrior, etc, every expansion... with the only new deck concepts based around costly legendaries... then you're in luck! blizzard has this game tailored just right for you, have fun!
---
but many of think they can do better. and that's my point
---
He said Blizzard, not Rare studios
---
Because Highmane is unplayable garbage right?
---
There are consequences though (I edited my comment). But the real life solutions are harder to implement in the internet because if someone in real life does something bad, they get punished there. But in internet, there are better ways to frame others for things they didnt do, or hiding your true identity while doing nasty things.
---
And at the end of the day, if you thing saying "hello", "well played" and "wow" deserves a punishment, Its just your own fault.
---
Polarisation is going to be more frequent in Wild due to the increased card pool. It’s part of the format.
---
Frost Lich Whizbang vs Whizbang, the Firelord
---
Fan is good, but the deck I run is more minion based. Even if you don’t have a strong board by turn 8, Hooktusk is great for getting new cards and clearing out their board, along with some spells.
---
What a well thought out post. You nailed it and have my upvote.
---
Yep. They need to do to Standard what they did to arena and do monthly set rotations including cards from legacy sets. Or at least have that as a mode. Something in between standard and wild. Because wild is a complete and total shit show, and standard gets stale after a few weeks post ex-pac, leading to 3+ months of delirium and boredom. The game can't continue to survive that.
---
does it board clear?

WHERE MY TREEEEES AAAAAAT
---
those two points are two of the reasons i find fun though.  which just proves his point, that different people find different parts of the game fun.
---
I predict a golden legendary every time I open a pack. I'm nearly always wrong.
---
Spent thousands on this game. Spent years practicing and learning the game. Finally made it to legend with control priest and odd rogue one season. Felt accomplished beyond all belief for 5 minutes. Realized how much of my time and money I wasted on this game that provides nothing to me but some occasional entertainment. I'm proud of you for hitting legend. But dont end up with time out of your pocket.
---
I have used general consensus from comments on plays/videos.  I could be mistaken.
---
"I lost a few games. Game bad."
---
DID SOMEBODY ORDER A BOMB?
---
*&gt;  Why so the majority of people, that don't like it, allow it?* 
---
We dont allow it though. Why do you think we allow it? Because it still happens? Well then, welcome to the real world, were some people are, and will continue to be, shitty to each other. Enjoy your stay.
---
*&gt;  It's like we allow a small group of shitheads to dictate how we act because if we resist it encourages them? That's fucked up* 
---
What???
---
Lol... Then why do people talk about it here?
---
I usually never dislike an opponent (except maybe emote spammers and/or ropers), i just proclaim my hatred of HS itself.
---
It's not even funny how many times the 'two cards I need are in the bottom of my deck', ALWAYS followed up with both of them appearing in the next games mulligan/opening hand against a deck you don't need them for...just to rub the salt in your wounds.
---
Just use both!

Don't need a formal announcement when your stream history paints the picture as is

Also your way isn't "proper".

You should have posted this on 4/20
---
The price would only seem reasonable to those coming from other card games. I and many others come from other pc/consoles games where spending $60-100 on a game means you'll get the entire game. When $60-100 in hearthstone only gets you 70% of the cards in an expansion (a lot of which are filler cards), it's just not worth it. 
---
So what I'm trying to say is...
---
People seem to forget hearthstone is also just an online game.
---
Energhized#2701 EU trading 80G, You go first!
---
How do you stop a one turn giant, Dadgar, into conjures?  Hell, even now I'm seeing more of a freeze mage deck list that's running that combo.  There's so many potential variations of this deck that make it more annoying than cube lock.
---
So far I've seen heavy spell mage, freeze mage, tempo mage, and big mage running this exact combo.  As where with cube lock, it was that one iteration and that's it.  Obviously some minor tweaked tech card choices between each cube lock, but it was still essentially the same exact build.
---
You mean Keleseth.
---
No it isn't. Dota has almost the same amount of heroes and we see 90%+ hero usage at major tournaments and TI. 
---
Riot is trash at balance.
---
Great in Arena, though!
---
Because as I said before, when someone loses a game, everythign the opponent does can be labeled as "bad". He plays a shit braindead deck, he won because he pays a lot fo money and has legendaries, he is so lucky, etc...
---
If the opponent emotes, then its "BM" because they want to see themselves as victims and because its easier to cope with the lost game if our opponent is a bad person. So they do comments like "*He is a shit guy he BMed me by saying "good game", wooooo I lost but at least im not a shit head like you"*
---
Does Janali trigger from the warlock hero power?
---
Pirate warrior...
---
But it's not lol
---
How come weapon destruction is so hot right now? Is Waggle's Pick good enough for most decks to run Ooze, or are there other weapons with such an impact being played? And why is it happening now then, and not during the Legendary Weapons time being in play?
---
Most Pc and console games should actually cost 90 dollars to be profitable, and thats why there are so many microtransactions. 70-80 is enough for the base game, not the entire game. Dlc, microtransactions, etc, all cost extra. If you come from other games, and the monetization of these games do not appeal to you, maybe the game just does not appeal to you
---
I’m in awe how Zarog’s Crown has gone mainstream.
---
Control can have a combo finisher. E.g. Anduin + Mindblast or Alexstrasza + Grommash. It wasn't the main goal of the deck.
---
Don't get me started on epics.
---
&gt; Multiple time legend player here.
---
That's an outrageous claim, sir.
---
Imagine being this confident and this wrong at once
---
Thats the price you pay. You dont /have/ to sit on cards. Force the bomb out, less value for the warrior when boom comes down, less you have to worry about later if you draw the bombs out.
---
These are only my observations. I was hesitant to draw bombs, but either you take them now, or take them later, when the warrior can get 6 boom bots and do even more damage.
---
The optimised version was indubitably a combo deck. But the deck took some time to get there.
---
Plus it's perfectly possible to have a hybrid combo-control deck.
---
Ggs :)
---
Yep. only time weapon removal hurt me in my legend climb was when i actually needed the pick damage to go face, the minion back to hand usually was beneficial. i hit top 500 today with your list by the way, so thank you lots
---
Greenskin was my first ever legendary. 
---
I dusted him to have enough to craft Leeroy. 
---
I just recrafted the captain few days back...

done
---
Infinite Togwaggle is a value combo without a doubt. It plays exactly like Mech'thun, except when you draw your whole deck your win condition isn't kill Mech'thun and auto win, it's shuffle crazy amounts of Togwaggle into your deck thereby securing a value victory by inevitability. That is undoubtedly an entire deck built around a single combo--deck full of card draw and cycle, built around a two card combo that requires you play your big minion and then another card to do something to it that secures you victory either automatically or inevitably.
---
Combo decks do not have to be OTK, or TTK, my friend. Just because you're used to decks building around lethal combos does not mean value combos don't exist because they do. Any deck that builds nearly completely around a very specific set of cards is a combo deck.
---
&gt;A 6 mana 10/10 would be played in ANY deck, from aggro to control
---
I'm not sure it would be played in *any* deck but it would certainly see play
---
Oh wow, that sucks. They need to find a new design for this.
---
This card single-handedly made me stop playing Warrior of any kind.
---
There's no way of knowing whether your opponent has Elysiana or not until you've played 20 minutes in the mirror. And when you end up teching her yourself because you have to, *then* you suddenly play against super greedy decks that also include Baleful Banker. It's so silly.
---
You are being downvoted, but I actually agree with you.
---
I think while a creative card, it doesn't have a place in a game like hearthstone that was always supposed to be about fun and fast paced games. She just gives too much value for what a game of only having 30 cards is about.
---
I think rather than deleting her, Blizzard should rework her. But, let's be real. They allowed Shudder to go on freezing games for so long. One can only imagine how many years, decades even, until they take action
---
Hasn't been played for a while though.
---
That buff is bugged, not the Prelate.
---
I.e. copying a minion with that buff with Faceless Manipulator also does not give the copy Rush.
---
Glad you're having good success friend! Congratulations on your legend push.
---
Closest you can get right now is mage with [[research project]]. A few streamers did some fill the opponents hand with cards [[Griftah]] and [[drakkari trickster]]decks last expo, but i havent seen anything like that in RoS.

2 months... or whoever long an arena season will be.

Right now an arena season was decided to be 2 months. But next season lengths might vary.
---
I’ve been adamant on this mechanic being possible since reveal
---
Ok, I made a half freeze mage that runs biology project and that free legendary to make people draw 6 in one but that’s the best I can get.
---
Okay, I can agree with that, only noting that "too much polarization" is very much one of those subjective evaluations that is going to differ from player to player.
---
I'm not satisfied by it. Hard tech for overpowered bullshit is not satisfying balance, to me.
---
Card text can overrule keywords. Just like Competitive Spirit is a secret that triggers on your turn, even though secrets aren't supposed to be doing that.
---
I played back then too
---
Not sure if this is supposed to be a dig at me or the ones who blindly say it's good but either way this is a very real and very common thing. It even has a name. [The Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).
---
I think this is a fair point for people to disagree on. Everyone has different preferences and different stuff they react to more or less strongly. If anything, I think I'm kind of bummed out the music is such a barrier for me, 'cause I love watching great HS content, and Dog seems like a really good creator and dude in general.
---
Why is no OTK positive? What are you smoking dude? HS at its core is a rock paper scissors game. Aggro/tempo, combo, value, midrange. The meta before this was IMO the best since it had representation of all. With no OTK decks currently, both the tempo decks and value decks don't have to worry about so they only need to gear their decks to win against each other.
