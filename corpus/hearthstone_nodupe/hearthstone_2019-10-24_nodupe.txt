I really love when the game lets you win via funky mechanics no one anticipated. It feels like an old-school Nintendo cheat code.

It happened to me with godfrey..
---
Yes, same for me as well. Old special portraits do work, I just played one with Tyrande.
---
Are you trolling? Do you really not see the difference between what Zephyrs does and what pretty much every other Discover card does?
---

---
Is Hearthstone your first card game? I don’t think you understand how design space works, both in terms of making sure there’s enough and making sure to not squander it. Hearthstone’s card design should continue as its currently progressing and not focus on shallow design space and flash over substance like you seem to want.
---
And saying “everyone dislikes” the latest dungeon runs is ridiculous. People complained about it and then there were dozens of posts a day for a few weeks and still people posting about it every day.
---
Sounds like you’re just burned out and want things that just seem fresh no matter how good or bad they actually are for the game so that the game can seem new again. But it’s not a new game.
---

---
Thanks! I'll check if I have these cards!
---
Honest question: if in a situation you have to concede to prevent harm to your kid, do you still feel anger about this concede afterwards? Just checking psychology here xD
---
How are people still supporting this game when the company is a piece of shit
---
Yeah, and basically turn it into another "netdeckerino brawl."
---
The main point is that companies like blizzard have been thrust into the middle of human rights discussions without any real tools to do much of anything about the actual issues.  And that, perhaps, we need to look at giving support to these companies through the government that allows them to take a stand on human rights issues without fearing retaliation.  
---
Historically, companies like blizzard really didn't want to take a stance on the issues of the world either way, blizzard just wants to make and sell games.  But it is clear that the world doesn't work that way any more, and it still isn't obvious how companies are supposed to deal with that fact.
---
Well I finally opened a lucentbark, so totally worth it XD
---
Honestly I don't see the fuss about cellphone pics.
---
No
---
Do you honestly think your garbage attempt at defiance makes a difference?
---
What? I have to actually use my brain and think about proper positioning and trading and not just play an OP card on curve? And it's not even constructed so I just can't copy+paste any tier 1 decks that everyone and their mother is playing?! DiS bRaWl BaD! Give me my insta-win constructed brawl, Bli$$ard!- This comment section right now.
---
“My dude” when you sign a contract you can’t just say whatever the fuck you want on live tv. Technically you can but they are within every right to punish you. Get outta your moms house and get a job and you’ll understand how contract breaches work, idiot
---
yeah you will be able to craft one whole epic with all that free dust xD
---
Wdym? It looks great. I hope they never change it.
---
Doesn't the board rotate the other direction sometimes though? I do agree that paladin is pretty powerful when it rotates the way you're describing it though.
---
Ranked bores me cause of how long everyone takes to play their moves. 
---
Fucking hurry up lol. turn 1 and taking 50s to drop a Murmy.
---
Bubble Blowing plus the Lance is a win condition in itself, I try to narrow my deck to be as small as possible to get the 'infinity' Lance active
---
Warriors was pretty mediocre in standard. Like, it was ok, but warrior was so awful outside of odd it didn't matter even when every other deck was odd paladin lol
---
The most substantive HS design piece so far is the "Class Identity" post.  So uh...
---
It wasn’t all from one defile.  We also played around a bit after.  I died on turn 1 of fatigue.
---
I wish it was just 1000 wins not 1000 ranked wins.
---
Yep, it's own :)
---
It just means you're a casual, like most people here.
---
5 years later...
---
Umm...I don’t think that’s why players don’t like this mechanic. This is one of the most infuriating boss gimmicks from the dalaran heist, because flooding the board is the only viable way to win. It’s not difficult to understand, it’s just boring and forces you to play aggro.
---
\*I won the game with 356 steed kills.
---
It adds charges to the Lance because it overloads by 1.
---
Same!
---
I would but everyone I queue into SMOrc's when I just want to summon infinite 'steeds.
---
Thanks! I haven't read this before. Can we call this Rexxar 'Ecce Smorc' then?
---
That's easy, all you have to do is giving up your human rights and bow down to Winnie the Pooh.
---
I think the magic number is still 14. Happened in one of my games and it stopped.
---
Yes. Maybe this is the reason. :(
---
the problem of having to answer real questions?
---
I'm using a kind of flagship android phone in the past half year  (galaxy s10) and i have never expected something so buggy. At least 33% of the times i have to relaunch the game. The startup HS logo stays on screen forever sometimes, getting entirely frozen (like meme windows), getting crashed, other weird glitches. I don't know what to say.
---
Indeed, I summoned 83 dreadsteeds in one game and killed the khadgar before my opponent could get it
---
I would disagree somewhat. You can’t lay down a list of company values along the lines of “Every voice matters”, and then say you never wanted to take a stand on the issues of the world.
---
how is togwaggle scheme infinite?
---
Seems to be more specifically ‘summon one of these’ rather than a copy.
---
YES YOU ARE THE \_\_ONLY\_\_ one. You are the special snowflake. You are the one special kid your mom always told you were. Yes, you are literally the only living human being who hates the new meta. The rest are mindless sheep. What a fucking degenerate OP.
---
**Shaman**
---
Weaknesses: Generating infinite card value.
---
Strengths: Freezing minions with Moorabi and overloading for 2.
---
seems^good^to^me
---
We get it you dreadsteed.
---
I've won every match the roatation went right without playing a single card except the coin and conceded every match the roatation went left unless the opponent chose a bad class, this is ridiculous
---
When will they fix the mobile app?
---
I played against a murloc shaman today and his deck had like 4 murmies!

Every time someone starts roping me, I just return the favor. Usually takes one or two turns before they stop. And then they start emote spamming because I won't stop once I started. Not until the game is finished.
---
Free Hong Kong.
---
&gt;If the game dropped 50% revenue because say people went en masse to this new Riot CCG then you'd suddenly see mass development and a complete change in the cost structure of the game to lure people back.
---
Heroes of the Storm were just shut down in those circumstances because Blizzard management had overvalued the game and gave items there premium prices. They tried lootboxes to give some incentives to the players who just play and hide prices, but they didn't try to lower the prices when the game was revamped in 2.0 and when it was revamped back.
---
Similarly WoW has never had it's services cost reduced however many people stopped playing.
---
So I don't know if that will be the scenario here
---
Some for me I didnt get the pack
---
I think you meant to use a different word there.  
---
This is pretty frustrating  
---
This is pretty dumb  
---
This is pretty irritating  
---
etc.
---
I thought it was something small like 14
---
Good point, thalnos is bad if you get him late but coiling evil totems or a ziliax is worth it imo. 
---
You play nzoth usually around 5-10 cards left unless you draw him after that, thalnos serves as an extra card draw to get you closer to an empty deck and in my experience it never fatigued me but maybe I highrolled so far it works for me, the deck is not rushing and you have quite the healing taunts to care about thalnos again from my experience.
---
You don’t really need luck, you need help.
---
I pity you.

Malding KEKW
---
Don't know what you are talking about, he looks fine. The Jaina one on the other hand is ugly and creepy.
---
Also, what is with Uther's head? It looks like he got hit with a pan straight in the middle of it. He got this fancy, golden armor but shampoo is too expensive for the best selling author?
---
I pity you for still playing blizzard games. Smh my head
---
Yeah dude you nailed the cuphead artstyle, and it fits surprisingly well with HS' style, congrats and such a great idea you came up with !
---
doesn’t mention blizzard at all.
---
You’re literally subscribed to HS; if you think playing them and enjoying them is sad, how sad is not playing them and lurking/trolling the sub, insulting people because you have very little self-worth?
---
You seem like such a sad little creature.
---
We can go all day fuckboy. Youre not gonna get the last qord.
---
I’ve never had the last qord.
---
Not even sure what that means, honestly.
---
Good luck with your spelling impediment.
---
yes, thinking about what to play while you have no mana left. That's big brain
---
But dreadsteed
---
Thank you, I needed that laugh
---
Pathetic. Yawn
---
So satisfying to watch
---
He has a point.

Ahahahaha you changed it!

How fucking EMBARRASSING!

You just tried to pretend it didn’t happen hahaha.

Not just you. After the first match I was chocked how trash this was. Then having to do another two... it was so boring.
---
I once had 6 copies of the basic cards and 3 of the wild ones. FeelsMobileUserMan
---
I can mindlessly do daily quests with webspinners though
---
This one is just shit
---
to go back you have to try and record a vocal message and then press on the background,that solves it,just it bother me that i cannot write
---
I did.
---
Saronite saw significantly less play after the nerf, as shudderwock seized to exist.
---
News flash, company "values" are hollow PR/HR tools and nothing more, no company actually gives a shit. And it's also not a company like Blizzard's responsibility to take a stand on a geopolitical matter like this
---
Hard to make work but still fun. Congrats
---
Just tried several times to connect to a brawl using Lightforged Uther. Got this error message every time. Other skins appear to work though. Just thought I’d put this info out there.
---
No mostly because it is not RNG so instead I use pure optimism to find more deck of wonders. One time had yogg box put 2 more in and had 11 scrolls go off in one turn..... I died from 30 by drawing like 10 cards from infestation and doom
---
\&gt; Low people think they know others because they know themselves
---
By the same ticket, people who rope, when roped themselves, assume the other player is doing so out of spite (because that's what they'd do), when in fact at least a small portion of the time they're genuinely busy with something else eg. answering the phone.
---
Which is why I never counter rope until it gets particularly egregious.
---
I agree, if we don't keep fighting there was no point in fighting in the first place.
---
That's ok... the end is coming.
---
Yeah, to add to that, the golden version of the dreadsteed doesn't have an animation, it's just gold and looks a bit fancier, vs actual dreadsteed which has movement in the golden animation.
---
Lmao un'goro syndrome for gul'dan again it seems. Is there any dead class other than warlock?
---
Go for rise of shadows next. High power level too and it'll be in standard for more than a year still.
---
To be honest I noticed it too, but it still sucks that you have to do it every time
---
It needs atleast 5 or 6, otherwise the other both will easily outlast it. That's ALOT of setup time
---
Why did blizzard choose a picture of jesus for Rexxars portrait?
---
Fuck off to r/politics.
---
Not to be a spoilsport but...
---
One of your horsemen is golden tho
---
It’s happened to me twice before
---
Yeah it was crazy. After a minute of it looping it just stopped and continued on with the game. I guess they things in place for when loops happen.
---
r/whoooosh
---
Good bot
---
Came here just to write something similar.
---
That's for stream sniping.
---
I was expecting them to bring back Devolve but we instead got his overcompensating brother.
---
There's no better experience if your opponent is a paladin/shaman and has the right rotation. It's just a hopeless game (as long as they hero power).
---
Except it doesn't.
---
Most people that "get good" fast in HS already had years and years of experience in other TCG games.
---
That base of knowledge you develop playing other types of card games is invaluable. You can only get it by playing for hours and hours.
---
Also, any one that is worth a damn is going to want compensation for coaching. If you're getting free coaching, you're likely getting someone that isn't much better than you are.
---
Had a win 3 tavern brawls, sorry guys
---
And where, in any reality, was Blizzard neutral in this entire thing?
---
spaghetti code
---
Did the mirage or the doomsayer trigger first?
---
That one's a poor way of doing it, as it only removes the one you play.
---
So if you had 20 BFFs, and played Ethereal Contract and a BFF, after the match you would be 19 BFFs

Nice man
---
Over the course of thousands of games, yes.
---
Hogger was my first golden legendary back in the day. He quickly became boom after I couldn't make him work.
---
Zentimo in Shaman decks. 
---
It's not a bad card, just one that people rarely play. It can totally swing games because people never play around it. I have found that you don't even have to carry spells that synergize with it in your deck as you are usually generating multiple spells throughout a game that will have synergy with it.
---
He did some heavy lifting in the wild elemental Reno mage, was occasionally a second Reno after ya played the death knight.
---

---
I think following your own rules and punishing someone for using your platform for their political statements is politically neutral.
---
I guess we should just agree to a difference of opinion, I am not really trying to convince you of anything, just explaining how I think about the whole situation and why I will be continuing to buy and support the company that keeps giving me great games.
---
Zalae and Firebat are two that come to mind
---
My favorite is firebat he uploads semi consistently
---
Ramen code
---
Ehh probably tier 3 ish but it's a good deck for learning the basics of the game
---
Mirage got shuffled in before being destroyed.
---
Do you have any tips for printing the artworks ? Like what kind of papers are you using ? Because everytime I tried to print hearthstone artwork the printout looks way worse than the one in my monitor.
---
No problems on a iPhone XS, and I play all day on a shitty guest WiFi connection at work.
---
о, русские в треде
---
I know it’s just a bad one :)
---
Random legendaries are always good
---
I would guess that what we see here is the fix.
---
Everyone that lost his basic cards got 2 new ones.
---
Except that he didn't lost his card but still got the new ones.
---
Damn.. I’ll get back to that support guy and explain that you stole my novice engineers!
---
I crash all the goddamn time! Lose a turn, lose a game..
---

The last leg of 10 lvls on a class gives you a selection of the basic golds, different per class. Getting all classes to max lvl will get you the full golden nuetral package.
---
Really? I’m on IPhone and I don’t have any problems at all. What type of phone do you use?
---
No shit.
---
It’s the new portraits, queue something else
---
I had defile 2x and it was glorious
---
Shadow#15359 NA looking to complete the watch and learn quest.
---
Most pro players offers paid coaching , just contact any of em if you re intrested 
---
If you can get legend its a good start, imo don’t bother pay a coach if you can’t even get legend since that means you need a lot to learn, as another guy said even being legend doesn’t mean you re good.
---
Being 5k legend mean you’re mediocre at least, even being top 1k doesn’t mean nothing. I mean , I’m around 700-500 legend every season and I make huge mistakes myself, and I still learn something every game 
---
Good players are top 200 or even top 100 every single month
---
How much time do you have to spend? It depends, maybe not much, maybe all the time of the world is not enough
---
250 gold, 1sou pack, 1 bd pack, 1 golden rare card, and a ton of fun that ranked cannot give me anymore
---
Ofc, if everyone rides the karma train, the steam will die down
---
Wha-

WAIT I THINK I MAY HAVE ALSO THOUGHT THAT AT FIRST WTF
---
Good Bot
---
This is easily the least fun i've had playing the tavern brawl.
---
Really outdid yourselves this time blizzard
---
I’m unable to at work, but it should be easy to find in Iksar’s tweets and replies. He only tweeted this in the last day or two.
---
I play on an IPhone XS Max and I’ve experienced one crash and that’s about it everything’s been working stellar
---
I used Bob's Bouncer against one of his two Highkeeper Ra's with a lone minion on my field. I had a 33% chance of killing both his Highkeepers, 33% chance of losing to the other Highkeeper if he survived the brawl, and a 33% chance of getting a board full of Highkeepers. Never tell me the odds!
---
Ok, thank you!
---
Enjoy all the easily won games as us samsing users are crashing all over the place.
---
I just read somewhere this is due to using the new 1000 win Portraits. I have yet to test it but I have been getting the same error.
