This is my favorite stuff to do!

What rank are you at now? Where are you looking to be?
---
And what type of decks do you enjoy playing?

The shaman came from another dimension.
---
ah the sweet taste of not a tavern brawl in place of my favorite format.
---
Same. That was my guarenteed legendary. Still haven't used it or crafted a deck for it. Waiting to see if something got comes out or I'ma have to dust his ass for the likes of siamat
---
At the very least you can abuse their TERRIBLE early game and set up for your own quests but yeah it seems dumb "literally doing nothing" is a game plan now.
---
How is that possible? Zephrys only offers Basic and Classic cards, not Expansion cards like Blast Wave.
---
somebody hit that pasta
---
Well yeah I would put him in a deck that empties duplicates extremely fast

To be fair Hearthstone must inevitably trend in this direction if Blizzard wants to keep selling packs.
---
Remember how all of 2018 people were outraged at the low playrate of new cards? It was because the swing potential power level of 2017 cards (in particular, the Death Knights) were ludicrous and game breaking. But it wasn't just the DKs or they could have nerfed those - several quests, cube, Kathrena, the recruit mechanic in general, and more all horribly broke the mana curve and the amount of power one specific card could produce.
---
Wild is practically defined by having as many broken mechanics that cannot reasonably be responded to as possible in a deck.
---
Blizzard *must* continue making broken cards for profit. There are now dozens of cards even despite removing so many from classic through rotation or nerfs in not just wild but standard as well that represent upwards of multiple times more value than their mana cost justifies. I'm pretty sure they do not intend to go back and reevaluate the equivalent of an entire sets worth of cards that were made to either push archetypes, create "powerful" synergies, or just more generally get people to buy packs to get them.
---
Luckily pulled a lotta good legendaries this expansion but I crafted shrivallah to run in paladin with tip the scales and chef nomi. Fun deck but disappointing lol
---
I've had the most fun with warlock legendary (not quest) it's like a midrangey zoo deck and it's fucking fun to play
---
Quest midrange priest dominates warrior although it’s a hit or miss with everything else

Control Warrior exists because of Conjurer’s Calling.

I was watching [this VoD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/463408048), where he was experimenting with it a little bit, so there were a lot of iterations. This is what I'm running with right now. I think second Sul'thraze is better than Arcanite Reaper, but I don't have one ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Note that I went from nearly 100% winrate from rank 9 to 6 to nearly 0% back down to low 7. Could just be bad luck, or could've just been good luck to start with...

I've had a lot of bloodlusts after a sticky N'zoth board when I was just looking for some removal tool or something. Feels good, man.
---
I like the card, I'd increase it's mana by 1 though so it doesn't come down too early.
---
But what if I am playing old Quest rogue and a bounce effect is actually the perfect card to complete the quest? I feel scammed...
---
Damn that's budget as can be.. so your telling me you are farming warriors with this? 
---
I have the quest but haven't been running shaman much
---
Or make it cost more

---
you go first please

I was playing Highlander Mage and had my Frost Lich Jaina already out. I'm on like 5hp and ready to take fatigue, and my opponent has a 5/3 on the board and there is no way I can take it out. I play Zephyrs having no idea what would be the perfect card and what do I get? Fire Elemental. Literally the perfect card in that situation. I deal with the 5/3, heal my hero for 3, and have a 6/5 with Lifesteal on the board. That's when I fell in love with Zephyrs.
---
I crafted hagatha the swamp queen and shudderwock for quest shaman, but then I realized I don’t like playing shaman.
---
Played a quest rogue into cw, game lasted 40 minutes, drained all my cards, died to fatigue.
---
The real question is if he gives you more than one of the options to win with style. Would be a hilarious misclick if he offers non-lethal options too
---
I think this is a strong case for why Dr boom is overpowered. Take him out of the list and all other winrates will drop like it's hot
---
I actually save a lot of gold. But I already have enough decks that I can play so I can get away with waiting. I'm not even complaining, just explaining why people might play with their old decks.
---
Oh, is that a leaked scene from Sword and Shield?
---
What's wrong with opening the Golden pack?
---
for a lot of us, rewards are irrelevant, I play tavern brawl because I love the wacky rules and whatnot, so for someone like me this isn't a tavern brawl, this is a week where I do not get to play my favorite format in a game that I love. I'm not saying brawliseum is a bad thing, I'm saying it is not a tavern brawl, why not just make it its own format entirely and give it a semi-regular schedule, people who love it get it on a schedule, people who want weird rules, get to have their weird rules, its a win-win.
---
Calling it now warrior is still going to be the best deck because doctor boom is stupid
---
To be fair all the new quests are hero power replacements which is largely what makes hero cards so powerful. The one off effects (ie, Zul'jin) can be monumental, but the game breaking mechanic is the constant value of a button that is often worth more than a card per turn by itself.
---
The shaman quest, for example, is proving way more valuable and influential than random spells off the Hagatha hero card. And then the only value in Hagatha is a 3 damage mutual board aoe. And the druid quest seems easily exceeds Dr. Booms in value generated over the course of an average game.
---
I will be truly surprised if they don't nerd control warrior soon. Every deck is made with thought: "how does it compete against control warrior?" That's not healthy.
---
I don't have Solia but I packed Kalecgos. Is that a good replacement?
---
Zephyr's apprentice?
---
I hate that literally any highlander deck can’t fight warrior at all because they might get a lucky bomb into your deck. Hey that deck needs some nerfs now man
---
But I'd you take a good look at the list. There are 4-5 cards that are knew as well. It's just there is less experimenting necessary when Dr boom gives you so much raw power
---
i open the brawl and see the banner. immediately close the tab
---
No
---
It honestly depends on if you have another coexisting highlander cards. 
---
Bran seems to be the best out of the 4 being a hunter jan’ali along with hunter having enough cards to support a highlander style of deck.
---
Reno can be pretty strong clearing the board and then leaving you some stats but he is no where as swingy as the old Reno. Still he is a good card so a Reno mage could work but it’s not as strong as conjuror mage. 
---
Elise is mainly use for combo shenanigans. I tried it out in a quest druid and it seemed ok.
---
Finely... is the weakest of the 4. The ability to get any powered up hero power seems amazing but paladin really doesn’t have enough good cards to support this type of deck. 
---
Personally if you have bran go for it. If you have Reno and Elise and other supporting cards like the quests go for it. If you have finely maybe you should wait. 
---
If you don’t have any of them wait because you can always make them later and zep is a amazing card but I don’t think it’s worth the highlander style of deck for just one card but I have seen some zoo decks play it because it always spots lethal.
---
I've reached 0 gold. Hello darkness my old friend, bye bye Brawliseum.
---
Tempo is an easy to understand but difficult to explain concept. Think of it as maximizing the efficient use of your resources and minimizing the efficient use of your opponent's. Rogue is the class most often associated with Tempo because it has some of the best examples of the concept. If you played Backstab into SI:7 Agent, you dealt four damage (possibly split between two targets) and put a 3/3 minion on the board for three mana. If you managed to kill one or two of your opponent's minions with that play, you've generated lots of tempo in that you managed to put remove resources from your opponent's board while generating resources of your own. You see the same thing in Mage occasionally. Tempo Mage used to spend three mana to play a 4/3 Kirin Tor Mage and cast a free Explosive Runes which would then destroy the next minion your opponent played and deal the excess damage to their face. That's a big tempo swing because your opponent spent life, mana, and a card and came away with nothing while you still have a 4/3 on the board.
---
Zoo is a deck archetype that focuses on playing small, efficient, and often resilient minions with the intent of using them to control the board through efficient trades with your opponent's minions. It's pretty much exclusive to Warlock since the class has the ability to draw a card every turn with its hero power, something essential if you want to be able to maintain board presence with such small minions.
---
It's different from a straight up aggro deck in that you want to trade more often than not with Zoo. The term itself comes from Magic: The Gathering where aggressive decks that ran similarly small, efficient minions that were often animals were called Zoo.
---
I had lethal in hand that doesnt count

Expansion day 2
---
Sometimes he gives you 2 turn lethal opportunities too, so keep an eye for that. Not every damage spell you get is lethal
---
It does.
---
But you can already complete it by turn 5-6, why would you put him in? He's way too slow.
---
I don't if you played this many cards but she's capped at 30 cards from other classes
---
Where did you think that I advocated for that? I said what I said and that was what I said. What you read seems highly different.
---
And the cap is 1? Never seen it happen before. I played Tess thief rogue memedecks since she was released and Ive never had this issue
---
Should’ve hero powered first just to be safe, but idk why it wouldn’t have given you fireball
---
I really wish they didn't get rid of Vanish, that was the closest thing Rogue had to a board clear and even then it was just used to delay the opponent.
---
I think tess (the same as shudder) has a cap of stuff she replays. Maybe she got to that cap and the iceblock didnt make it?
---
Im trying to think explanations, but if it didnt reached the cap then I would list it as a bug, since I cant find any other explanation.
---
I will say this, there are those douchebags who don’t want to try new decks when a new expansion releases and only play the meta decks of previous expansions to get free wins/high ranked. Don’t think that it is set in stone that Control Warrior will remain at the top.
---
There’s a chance that it may well stay at the stop this ENTIRE expansion, but don’t fret about it right now. I’m sure there are some people in the Legend ranks actively trying to find the best decks/new top decks/decks to counter Control Warrior right now.
---
Don’t get discouraged by it, just sit back and enjoy some new cards.
---
nah the cap is around 5 or 6 i think
---
where can I submit bug reports?
---
I think so, discover is way too powerful for a hero power.
---
The mob mentality is definitely real in this sub.
---
But why does he have double the attack of a goldshire footman?
---
togwaggle's scheme the lab recruiter, ez
---
Paladin with tip the scales and using zephyr when you run out of duplicates to search for lethal is looking stronger than expected (look hs replay data for the exact decklist).
---
Thats the only succesfull zephyr deck im seeing. But lets see if this deck keeps being viable once the meta settles.
---
It only gives basic and classic cards
---
nvm found it
---
A Turtle Made it to the mage deck
---
I mean with Giants it's already a strictly better version since it also summons them with full health and costs less mana
---
Had Kalecgos on the board, so naturally I was looking for high-cost value spells that I could play for 0 that turn. One of the offered choices was a 1 mana card. I ignored it at first ... until I realized that Inner Fire works pretty well with a 4/12 body.
---
I love this card. I hope people don’t start complaining about it because I would be so sad if it got nerfed
---
One was Satan, the other was Lucifer. Both were cancer
---
Aha thanks! I'll hold on to my dust for now!
---
I somewhat disagree, it’s a hit or miss to craft before card changes and some people probably wait until after the mid-expansion changes to craft anything.
---
Also, it’s a bad idea to craft ANYTHING at the beginning of an expansion. Just because a streamer is pulling off the Mogu Cultist combo doesn’t mean anyone should be crafting them.
---
It also procs on twinspell cards from other classes
---
Blame the shitty players
---
I tried going the deathrattle mech that draws deathrattles, loot hoarders, and Bloodmage Thanos. It exists. It's still just better to run good cards and hope to curve out.
---
Because Inner-fire priest and priest in general has a winrate of around 40 percent. When a Tier 4 deck is so much of a Problem to you, than maybe, just maybe, there is something wrong with your deck.
---
Death knights are too slow in wild. Best hunter and mage decks don't play Rexxar or Jaina.
---
At least you can actually cast these. Nothing feels worse than when you get something like deadly poison off thoughtsteal and it just eats a spot in your hand the whole game.
---
I don’t think so, if you have lethal on board with a specific card he will give it to you, but if you have a combo in hand he doesn’t. Eg in Thijis’ most recent video he had lethal if given BEES due to some cards in his hand, but it didn’t give it to him
---
yeah but thats because pirate warrior is basically dead unless they have killed their opponent or starved them of resources through value trades by turn 5
---
I don’t have the cards/dust to make any standard decks, so I threw together and autocomplete priest and conceded 3x in a row. Got Octosari from the reward pack
---
Lol.
---
I tried to create a "infinite wishes" deck that kept on adding Zephyrs to your hand. It is....ok..... Does anyone know of a already created deck like that?
---
Is that not allowed being a part of a thread? Well excuse me.
---
I recall hearing that he was bugged if you had 0 attack minions to not count them as damage with buff effects (i.e. opponent has 9 health, you have 5 mana and three 0 attack minions he won’t offer Bloodlust).
---
There may be little bugs that collective playerbase can better find/report.
---
Machinegun was the last highlander deck viable, and that was 2 years ago. It doesnt exist anymore, even less in wild.
---
Renolock is tier 3 in wild.
---
People need to learn, not to trust Blizzard on balancing.
---
Get used to it. Businesses are not loyal to any nation, they do where they think will make them the most money and as China continues to grow as a market, it will be more common to see media created with Chinese audiences and thus Government censorship in mind.
---
If they were any good at balancing the game then they would have done it before the expansion. If the design team is seriously waiting to see if these new cards limit the effectiveness of Dr. Boom, then they are hopelessly inept.
---
Although I guess we already saw that when nerfing Rogue was their answer to Warrior.
---
I lost interest and hype about the new expansion within the first hour single handedly because of CC. so much BULLSHIT
---
The Rogue Quest deck is board centric and you're usually going to lose that battle against Quest Druid unless they draw dead.  On the plus side you'll win on board against most other things and it looks like Rogue with lackey and burgle elements is here to stay in some form or fashion.  If you go more aggro you'll have a better time.  Here's the premiere Rogue aggro deck right now:

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Vulpera Scoundrel is seeing some play instead of Faerie Dragon from that list, but you can also switch some things out according to what you have in your collection.  For instance you can't go wrong with an extra 1 drop like Crystallizer or Mecharoo (and if you run Mecharoo you can put in a small Mech package with Sn1p-Sn4p and Zilliax if you have either, or go even harder with the Mechs though at that point you may be better off playing Mech Hunter), Raiding Party with some Preparations and Dread Corsairs, Waggle Pick instead of Hooked Schimitar, or Togwaggle possibly with some EVIL Cable Rats (though this is still slow against Druid).  You can also still run your Quest list but either be happy to eat the matchup, or try to figure out your best outs and always play toward them -- even teching a bit by putting in a Cold Blood if you notice you often have early board able to go face could add some extra percentage points.  Over time it's also possible other decks could push out or push down Druid as we've got a long way before the meta settles
---
At rank 20 you can get away with unoptimized and janky lists, but if you want to move up or specifically beat a certain matchup you need to know the other deck's weaknesses.  Druid takes 4-5 turns to get online, more if you force them to play things early to stabilize (ie if they have to Swipe on 4 or risk losing to your board + Leeroy next turn), and then from there they need to either draw Hidden Oasis or they die to reach.
---
Did you have 3 mana? There’s no way the AI missed lethal.
---
The weirdest part is I just didn't bother to check cause he somehow knew I had the mage hero power, sounds like a lucky 1/9 guess
---
Even without Zephyrs or updating it I found decent success with machine gun Priest. 
---
But that nerf to it being a one cost hero power after the buff was really brutal.
---
Yeah it's an insane deck. Lost against it several times. I'm stuck between plot twist warlock and quest druid as my next deck to build.
---
Seemeoutside#1998 80g quest trade go first
---
Wtf
---
Nope its pretty great you just need to wait 4 more expansions than dust it ez 400 dust
---
I think comboin it with the locust cloud, unleash the hounds and revenge of the wild its good. At least, it looked like it had a ton of burst and reach after completing the quest in the reveal stream.
---
Outside of that, it looks way too slow, as you say.
---
Honestly none of the quests seem that good. The druid one is powerful once you activate it but you have to waste your first 5 turns to do that.
---
I had 5 mana.
---
I bet conjurers will be nerfed to 5 mana in 6 weeks. This and beeeees will only target enemy minions (or doesnt trigger overkill anymore)
---
Agreed. 
---
There's no reason to be an apologist to something that's obviously out of hand. As others have mentioned, there's other games that more actively balance and address such issues and it's absolutely beneficial to the player base.
---
After 30 hours of Uldum and a overwelming support towards the card you are calling it underappreciated?
---
Well they’ve consistently removed ways to generate a board of charge minions. It’s not in the game. If there was a hunter version of soul of the forest it would be easy. 
---
Maybe at my rank and my 8 win brawliseum run my opponents all misplayed, but it felt like it was easy to generally create a board that was difficult to deal with.
---
CC power level is busted. Just because Khadgar enhances it LOL WTF levels doesn't mean that CC is not OP by itself. its ridiculous and with Khadgar even not ridiculous.
---
He knows how many cards are in your hand but not what cards they are.
---
Deathrattle Hunter is better against control warrior than big shaman.  The value that deck generates is nuts with Nine Lives.  Warrior can only remove so many 7/7 mechanical dragons.
---
Then you must’ve not been showing lethal. It doesn’t make mistakes like that. Trump/blizzard confirmed.
---
It doesn't
---
I got 4 quests, warlock warrior, hunter and mage. I just wanted druid or shamon or preist lol.
---
Played like 20 games with Quest Hunter yesterday. 
---
It sucks ass. The only real way to get it is with really good Unleash the Hounds + the new 7 Locusts spell. But those are also the best payoffs for the quest so once you actually do get the new Hero Power you usually have spent all your creatures. Every game I won was from doing normal Hunter things rather than as a result of the quest reward.
---
And the existence of these 2 cards is already ruining the experience, which is the point.
---
Exactly, especially since their answer to Warrior last expansion was to nerf Rogue and hope the Warrior problem just magically goes away.
---
Dude, how is it not showing when the opponent has 6 life and I have 5 mana. What information here is hidden?  He had 6 life when I played Zephrys. Why would I lie?  If this isn’t intended then it’s a bug, that’s fine. But currently, lethal is NOT guaranteed.
---
And would be an insane nerf to evolve shaman.
---
Maybe the cards aren’t worth playing tough guy
---
Like yogg you must always believe. Had a whole board of big deathrattle bois on the enemy priest side, played my yogg box I got from treachery and pulled plaque of death. On my tess got lethal with it
---
Is it just me or is this expansion fun as hell?
---
Isn't that a priest card? It plays class cards? :o
---
Then u missed lethal
---
Its tog disguising as a Vulpera.
---
Just an announcement saying it will launch in 1 month but 0 details yet
---
That's a problem with warrior by itself (well arguably its good that at least one class can sort of deal with aggro a bit better honestly). But it doesn't remove from the fact CC is simply busted.
---
You mad he switched to a superior game that doesn’t cost 240$ a year?
---
Hey man so was I lmao wasn't expecting it really, best of luck to your runs too
---
Do you have a decklist? I’m dying trying to figure out how to make this deck work. Is it a zoo deck? Is it tempo? Midrange? I just don’t get it. I just lose at rank 9 with it.
---
So far have tried variations with mass hysteria and scaleworm but they usually dont fair much better than having bulkier minions that help the quest along.
---
As a side note, the deathrattle off Shadequill does apply towards the quest goal
---
updoot
---
Haha, no I didn’t.
---
Theres a petition for it
---
I believe only tournaments follow the "Player with more health gets the W" rule. In-game, it's just a draw
---
God forbid someone doesn’t feed your ego by telling you that it’s not your fault that you’re losing with quest hunter.
---
From my perspective that is stupid. Also I dont subscribe to tradition. I subscribe to logic and reason and what's right. It supersedes everything.  ♡
---
Finally, a deck my immortal prelates will beat
---
Oooh that deck looks much better than mine. I tried running both eggs and did a “destroy your monster” kind of zoolock that was much slower. Thank you!
---
I respect that, but you should also respect people who use the academic way. Then we will have no problem overall.
---
Yeah, at least this deck has variety. Though it’s tough to tell how viable any of it will be.
---
RemindMe! 1 month
---
Tempo Rogue definitely deserved to be nerfed. When every single deck is running Acidic Swamp Ooze you know you've got a problem. I was referencing a comment made at the time where they thought Rogue leaving the meta would limit the strength of Warrior.
---
We're now in this situation where we have to wait a month for the meta to settle, just because action wasn't taken earlier. Blizzard should have been aware that Dr. Boom strategies were going to be incredibly strong and oppressive and preemptively moved it to the Hall of Fame. Now people are losing interest in the expansion at the quickest rate we've ever seen and it's hard to blame anything besides the terrible balancing shown by Blizzard.
---
It's not advertised as a new mechanic, just a thematic inclusion to the card set. Not unlike "If this dies on your turn" Deathrattles in Knights of the Frozen Throne, Spellstones in Kobolds and Catacombs, "Swap this minion's attack and health" Gilnean Worgen in Witchwood, and Spirit of the [Loa] cards in Rastakhan's Rumble.
---
As a jaded wild player I might be a bit biased but I would actually say yes, but only up to a point where the novelty starts wearing thin.   
---
At higher ranks, the game becomes repetitive against the same powerful decks, so although you become very familiar with matchups, the game gets extremely grindy, especially when said decks are inherently overtuned. 
---
Wild is even more of a problem, where Big Priest is everywhere and each game is decided by who draws Barnes first. Not to mention that the deck is unable to be interacted with outside of a few classes. 
---
My advice is to play through the lower ranks, enjoy the novelty of playing and brewing your own decks. Once you feel like you're pressured into meta decks by the other players in your rank, then reconsider what parts of the game you enjoy.
---
That's sort of more asinine, though. The classes with armor have an inherent advantage then, particularly when warrior/druid are famously the two classes known for turn-timer, clowny shenanigans
---
It's a pain to deal with.
---
They didn't advertise it as a new mechanic though.
---
It was a flavourful cycle that headlined because it fit the story and setting well.
---
I'm guessing Zilliax didn't disappoint here
---
There have been other cases where Zephry doesn't offer silences when they would be useful.
---
owo wat is dis
---
Congratulations, you can name cards.

[Yes it is](https://i.imgur.com/9kFEH9q.png)

Battlecry: Win the game
---
 I kinda miss him on the first day of the expansion. Man, we really did lose a good streamer
---
Ya, this made me emotional once as well
---
I wonder if one had no cards in hand, in deck, in graveyard or on the board.... what would Zephrys consider the "perfect" card to play by itself in a vaccuum?
---
Lemme guess.... people didnt stop asking for the card reveal?
---
My point is that he was a bit tired of hs.
---
Gorehowl is part of the Classic Set and can be played in Standard.
---
I just spent most of my dust to finish making Murloc Paladin so I hope it remains good. Even if it's not, I'm having the most fun I've ever had playing this deck!
---
There's a big difference between rotating a classic card at all and rotating an expansion card early.
---
Azure Drake would probably still be the default five drop minion for midrange and control oriented decks. Team 5 does not want any classic neutral card to be the default anything. That's how you get Standard formats that feel the same year after year after year.
---
Expansion cards are designed knowing they'll be rotated out within two years after their release. Genn and Baku (along with the rest of the Even/Odd support) were rotated early because they were two of the most format warping cards ever created. Dr. Boom, Mad Genius is nowhere near that level still, let alone one to really justify an induction before next April.
---
Additionally, Patches and Raza were nerfed specifically for Wild and their worry they would forever dominate the format. You can see that in the card change notes.
---
Molten Giant went from a god awful card in Wild to a reasonable one.
---
If Patches and Raza were reverted, they'd go from being somewhere between reasonable and very good to the exact same format nightmare they were prior to their card changes. Patches is still an extremely powerful card without charge. There's not even any reason to change it back.
---
I had to teach myself to day to add up lethal with bloodlust every turn.
---
I liked it when you had limited resources and armour meant something. Now you can Shield Slam a 3 drop. Who cares. You have 5 more Omega Devastators anyway.
---
Huh, not exactly an intuitive way to implement that, never noticed anything in any of the blue posts
---
Anyhoo, good to know, guess I delete this thread then?
---
I’ve been having a blast trying different highlander. Played warrior shaman priest and mage and had unique games every time with pretty consistent success. We will see if that keeps on into the meta development
---
It still is a cycle, and it is well-known the card was changed last minute due to the recent class identity blog post.
---
It’s Wild, brah
---
Or it totally fails and they lose too much tempo
---
It's an extremely intuitive way to implement it when you think about how many possible combinations of cards there can be in your hand and how difficult it would be to design Zephrys with all of them in mind.
---
SMOrc is a twitch emote, it stands for Space Marine Ork.  [There's a song that explains it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jenlSf2E8o)
---
Great, I dont see many others posting about this, maybe its affecting only a small population.
---
Around 100 packs, pre order golden was Brann, packed golden Colossus of the Moon and golden Shaman Quest, also packed both Priest legendaries, Zephrys, Siamat, Mage and Paladin quest, both Warrior legendaries. 
---
I'd say I got pretty lucky
---
Comon Whizbang, don't let me down!
---
It's really not that strong. I've played many games with it and I still lose to aggro. It's just good against greedy decks and midrange decks with a bad start. You also have to draw pretty well.
---
Well it's a discover. Maybe the enemy took the pyro  instead of the fireball. You never know
---
Thinking about dusting a golden Prophet Velen I got not too long ago just to craft this dude.  Played a game with Whizbang earlier and he gave me 3 perfect lethal options.  So crazy late game and so good early game.
---
When does Rasta rotate again?
---
I'm really looking forward to that sweet 1600 dust. That's fun in its own way.
---
which would be weird move for big priest. i calculated it earlier, even with 40 fatigue procs and a board full of 3 attack minions, you could deal around 1300-1500 damage.  which is barely above 50% of this HP amount
---
Don't worry it's actually not
---
Everyone is tired of HS. We lose savjz to artifact (now underlords) and now we lose Toast to TFT. I just hope that the community does not take every streamer as granted they still have feelings and most of all he needs our support the most.
---
I dont think it will ever give you pyroblast because it cant be used on that turn. Maybe if you get him to cost 0 mana it will so it, but not when you only have 8
---
Siamit is worse zilliax because it has no Lifesteal, and it's 2 mana more
---
yeah u pretty much got all the bad ones. But the good thing is whenever you open a legendary from now on its probably a good one
---
&gt;Seemeoutside#1998
---
sent
---
TFT community treat Toast better than us
---
What makes you say that? Looks like it's performing pretty well to me.
---
It's really not that strong. You guys are just playing unrefined greedy control decks that don't do much in the early game. Quest Druid dies to any early form of aggression.
---
One-fifth of a card per turn.
---
That's Dr. Boom's average per turn card generation. That's next to nothing outside the grindiest of control matches. Omega Assembly produces as many cards as it would take Dr. Boom to create over fifteen turns.
---
That line too is in reference to the card compared to Deathstalker Rexxar and Frost Lich Jaina. Dr. Boom is almost nothing to them even with the rush arua.
---
The card is powerful, the card is strong, but if the deck without the card wasn't as strong as is it, the card wouldn't be able to carry the deck like Frost Lich Jaina did with Big Spell Mage. Additionally, a Tempo Warrior wouldn't be able to play the card and become a control deck when needed like all Hunter decks were able to do with Deathstalker Rexxar.
---
Oh cmon, despite the underlords dev team being the same from artifact, doesn't make it artifact :v
---
I honestly think this is a bug: overkill is supposed to trigger when you attack an (over)kill a minion, not the other way around; here bee...es clearly says you summon the bees and they attack the target, so overkill should not trigger.
---
Its also 2x Bees
---
I put a hungry crab in my highlander mage, but didn't go up against any murloc decks for the next 20 games. Closest thing is Shaman that plays the lackey 1 drop murloc but didn't draw it those times.
---
I do it too. The ancient blades are great for the beginning and might lure out  some weapon removal. And then you get the cutlass. And if that one breaks you simply use the ancient blades again. Works really well.
---
it can only choose cards from the base set/classic
---
How do you OTK with this? Doesn't seem like you have the spells for beardo?

Thanks Drew. So far I’ve been having a blast.
---
Or just use it with Shaman Quest.
---
or make it cost more. the card splits things in half. if the card itself didn't split in half then some flavor is lost.

Assuming he's running Valeera DK, with the lab techs and the coldlights he's able to:
---
1) Go infinite
---
2) Massively accelerate the rate at which the opponent will take fatigue (assuming they don't have Idols)
---
So either it's a draw, or OP should win
---
Mass Dispel and Plague of Death: Allow us to introduce ourselves.
---
Thank you I may give it a try :)
---
Yeah, I can imagine that after that you chill a little and wait for the combo to assemble
---

---
Warrior and Priest.

---
dr boom is not reactive what, if anything it is the complete opposite
---
you want to get it out asap
---
I know it's stupid, but currently I just concede automatically when matched with warrior. It's not fun for me to watch an endless game of basically nothing but reactions.
---
Did the same when Old Gods/Kharazan aggro Shaman was at its peak. I kinda always end up just not playing a class if it's too dominant. I don't care that much for rank nor win streaks, so I'd much rather just have fun.
---
And for the record, it's not about me being angsty to lose, but I also don't want to have a 30 minute cointoss that requires me to draw perfectly and my opponent suboptimal to have the slightest hope of victory.
---
This guy knows what's up. Midrange Hunter is pretty fun and solid all the time. Also grinding out the arena with 4+ wins is a good way to actively get dust when you finish daily. Although I find it kinda hard bc I suck at building decks like that.
---
Paladin quest is actually pretty good. Check out reborn decks, they are quiet OP and not a whole lot expensive.
---
280 damage a turn takes only ten turns to eat through the armour.  Just need to run them out of poison seeds.
---
Long time player hoarding gold few month before release, or pre order, and people who buy pack with money after release.
---
From when I used to play this game a lot I usually had between 50 and 80 packs with gold, plus a few arena which allowed me to enjoy the game.
---
If you ask this, I guess you are a new player, a good advice is to save gold starting usually a month or two after an expac will allow you to have a decent gold amount for the next one.
---
But nerfing cards that are busted is
---
Not really anyway to play with newbies, The only way to get more cards is grinding out wins for long times or buying packs with your money. Arena is another option but you have to be good to make your collection better through that.
---
If you're in the EU I might be able to help you out somemore if you need a quick way to complete those quests
---
missed 2 quests already, bug fix waiting room
---
Yea I'm missing a quest too
---
I think you are guaranteed to get whole collection if you open around 300 packs in total.
---
why u immortal? \^\^ nice list
---
Rogue Quest is pretty good.
---
No I’m saying u can kill him before turn 5 since he didn’t play anything before that
---
Coming to any class near you thanks to Zephrys.
---
Lorewise, yes. Mechanically, murlocs are closer to slivers.
---
Yeah, I built my own deck, basically an aggro paladin with reborn and buffs, and it’s incredibly strong. I was actually surprised and realised how broken copying reborn minions is. Such a sticky board that you can just keep on adding to.
---
The new 1 mana 2/1 that gains attack for every new minion triggers off the hero power and from reborn minions too, so you can really snowball just copying that minion and playing reborn cards.
---
I think if it becomes a meta deck, priest, shaman and warrior will naturally counter it though. I can see it squeezing out rogue, hunter and warlock from the meta though...we will see.
---
That is INSANE. I got only 2 legendaries but 11 epics from opening that amount.
---
Who won?
---
insert Ben Brode laugh
---
I started playing the game a few months ago, there are things that I'm still learning, can someone please explain what exactly is wild.
---
good watch
---
I’ve been trying out different decks and quest paladin hits that sweet spot of value, aggro and board stickiness. If it becomes meta there’ll be natural counter decks like priest and shaman, but as it stands now it’s very strong against unrefined and greedy decks.
---
I’ve also got only the first quest
---
Whizbang or Zayle
---
But then people would cry about “muh flavour, 7/7/7”
---
Honestly, and this is outrageous, if it takes Hagatha going with it, just Hall of Fame it.
---
They literally just sent *two* legendaries *and* all their related cards to the HoF when RoS released, Genn &amp; Baku. It's amazing how wrong you are.
---
Are y'all doing ok over there in Wild? Because things are starting to look more memey than usual
---
This was very amusing and painful to watch. Thank you

As soon as people notice that Priest is actually good &amp; that Trump was incorrect with his ratings, people will also notice that Priest is practically in an auto-win situation right now against both of those classes. Since launch I’ve swooped into rank 3 all the way from rank 18 (I took quite a break from the game), exclusively by using Priest decks. 
---
I’ve faced very little resistance from any other class. I can not express enough how easy it was to climb. Priest is also far and away the class I’ve encountered *least* on ladder so far in Uldum. I still can’t tell why everyone is stupidly avoiding using it, or stupidly assuming it sucks. 
---
Control Warrior hasn’t given me any problems so far. CC Mage has given me even fewer problems.

Incoming nerf: BEEEES!!! cannot be targeted on friendly minions.
---
It's been a while since we had a ShowerThought in this sub. Much appreciated sir!
---
Well you have to reach turn 10 with unflexible cards sitting in your hand. Not exactly powerful - but it is true it's an auto-win to most slow decks.
---
I'm currently playing a highlander shaman, and he feels... ok. It's always satisfying to play HP + Zephrys + Lynchen to get a ton of value. But in regular situation, HP + Zephrys isn't that good and spending 2 extra mana is not worth it. So I'd say that Zephrys in quest shaman is an interesting experiment but I'm still not shure if he is worth going highlander.
---
yeah i posted a different clip yesterday but people thought i was complaining about snip snap when in actuality its so awesome to me. i havent seen that before, if you have the link, can you share that to me?
---
I’d play it if I had Amet, but I don’t so Murlocs and Micro Mummies will have to do
---
expected TCSA. Slightly disappointed.
---
This total is pretty impossible for me, as I bought 40 packs for RoS, then the adventure came, then I accumulated another 4000+ for 40 packs again...sigh
---
3 card combo + Thaurissan or 4 if you include Innervate instead.
---
Unless those slow decks are Exodia Mage, Mill Rogue, or Mechathun...
---
Why would you share this? :O
---
He didn't give me 100 shadowsteps and edwin when i had 3 mana open, unfortunate
---
Go to the collection, go to crafting, and take a look at all of the cards in standard. It might take awhile, but then you'll have an idea on the cards in the meta right now.
---
Please make this a thing!!
---
It’s just a psa reminding you that murloc is in wild and murloc is in standard, with a couple of neat dinosaur pics throw in for fun
---
i had that happen with the boomsday project, i bought classic packs instead. Thankfully i didnt open them and I got them switched.
---
It removes the armour, yeah
---
I wish I knew what is Boom and CC or SOU or ROS.
---
You know how to outvalue 23 Omega Devastators? 24 Omega Devastators! Haha gotem.
---
Activision Blizzard.
---
Thx for the answer! My max rank was 16 so I am a very bad player haha 
---
But I don’t play or invest to much.. 
---
i might try that deck!
---
Weird looking outfit. Artist dosent play wow
---
at 5 mana its still faceless manipulator with twinspell and khadgar synergy
---
Am I the only one who likes the effect? I feel like people are exaggerating over how much it covers the art.
---
Well, there are plenty of us.
---
And I just thought, this is I who's turning crazy...
---
I used whizbang and ended 3-3, was expecting  a clean 0-3
---
There's a reason control shaman isn't what everyone complains about. Strictly out valued by warrior (warrior player)
---
So basically I was lowroll and give my opponent two Shaman murloc, but considered my luck, it perfectly make sense.
---
Why does there have to be a mage Vs warrior fight in every thread? Obviously boom and conjurer's are both problematic cards.. it's not an either or, it's a nerf both.
---
I love ysera and I use her in both resurrection priest and big paladin (with duel!) and I've loved her ever since.
---
You're right. Her outfit doesnt fit wow or real life fashion
---
Reno isn't even that strong in arena
---
LackeyLock is extremely fun.. if quests become extremely prominent I could see it becoming part of the meta.
---
I've been playing a grip of it and lemme tell u it is so much more fun than quest shaman, quest rogue, &amp; quest druid (been playing them all) 
---
You are assuming an aggro style but not entirely zoo more mid-range
---
I think it's really fine, won against one last night. healing is not that strong in arena and it does create drafting constraints
---
I just had a game with frozen minions vs doomsayer and got nothing to silence/kill it.... cabal shadow priest, soul of the forest, and tirion... luckily one of my frozen minions was rag and it hit the doomsayer. 
---
Where’s the crazed alchemist or any other effect though
---
Oh boi, there's always people crying out 2 days in the expansion right
---
Well the past few years have been bad to warrior. Let the class have its day, next year it'll be a different class.
---
So if I understand how you play it: 
---
- wait to have floop and the 2 cultists in hand and elise.
---
- Duplicate with elise: you have 4 cultists and 2 floop
---
- play one floop again, you have 8 cultists 2 floop...
---
Something like that?
---
Secrete and secret are two different words.
---
Lol how can you get out value by CW is beyond me. You have double elysiana, CW is not. Boom Warrior can win but Control Warrior have no chance
---
I’ve also had the same two quests the last two days and have not received a third daily quest.
---
Or just remove the glow once the effect is consumed.
---
it's from rastakhan's rumble
---
Waiting for this to happen. Go do it !
---
Good idea, actually, since I don't play arena that much, I didn't even know that there is a set rotation in there.
---
Got a list?
---
Secret Paladin is extremely bad and boring... How can you have fun with this deck, quest Hunter is sort of fun but really weak too, like most of the decks.
---
Sure, then we'll have even more fun with "deck full of double battlecries," "deck full of 'choose both'," and Conjurer's Calling.
---
That's... the point of the post?
---
There is definitely decision making involved for Control, like using Dyn-o-matic or Militia Commander. Using Plague of Wrath of Brawl or Super Collider.
---
Honestly.. if you have over 3,000 gold I'd say for sure craft it. Your still going to need some other cards to make that deck competitive bcz hagatha is a pretty late game value oriented card. The weaponized wasp, lifedrinkers, &amp; new elementals that do 1 damage all enemy minions 1 overload seem pretty crucial to the deck. As well as lackeys such as the shaman murloc from ROS. I'd start small and build up just so you know for sure it's the deck you want to be playing.
---
Yup that's the thing. If you pull ANY class legendary in this expansion it will require a significant amount of support from this specific expansion and the top cards from priors. Bcz of quests there are so many new archetypes that require certain cards.
---
With that being said, octosari might fit in a deck soon, but it will require a lot of dust to craft that deck probably. It'll be either a deathrattle or some sort of super aggro that uses it as a refill. Wait a few weeks check it's stats or see if it's in any decks and decide then. I haven't dusted him yet but probably will if I feel siamat is a must include.
---
I didn’t get one what do I do? I play on iOS.
---
Does work on an iPad
---
Source: I play mainly on an iPad
---
I have always been F2P and secret/tempo mage has always been my first choice. The core of the set is pretty cheap and you have a lot of option to improve it later. If you have Luna or Subject 9 you can immediatly swap them with the acolyte of pain.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Also with all the cheap lackey, splitting image is better than Mirror entity but it's an epic. 1 spellbender secret, also epic, could be a good way to surprise an opponent too.
---
You also have people playing a version with less minions, more cheap spell and the mana cyclone. Since mana cyclone is an epic I didn't build something like that but it could be viable.
---
Have all the cards you mentioned in the second paragraph
---
*Shrooooooooommms*
---
Haven't tried on tablet or iPhone.
---
I mainly play on my android phone (S7)
---
Me neither. I wanna dust them but I still want to pull greenskin, baine, and tirion lol
---
Seems pretty simple to me
---
Is there a good decklist for quest druid?
---
The zoolock and quest Priestt decks could have been so much better too
---
I also usually leave up 2 quests and I'm pretty sure I logged in and had just those 2 quests I left again today.
---
RemindMe! 14 days
---
Happened to me also
---
50 g times 60 days =3000 gold. That's not including daily wins, or any 80 gold quests you might be offered, or any 60 gold quests, or even the elusive 100 gold quests.

First of all, it auto selects the expansion. You should explicitly select the expansion you wish to purchase.
---
Secondly, the select radio of expansions visually looks good but from the user interface isn’t really well-made to be clear.
---
Lastly, clearly from all the cases that people bought the wrong expansion, you can make a conclusion that something’s wrong with that screen.
---
I said either remove rush or HOF. For the cost of 7 Mana u should not be receieving that much value. Or simply nerf to 9 Mana and keep as is. You do understand rush on every minion gives you a significant edge every single turn right?
---
&amp; I'm not too familiar with old heroes or Wild as I started ROS but I do know there were more heroes back in the day. They may have been unbalanced as well, but Dr boom has no place in standard when zuljin is played on turn 10 and is completely RNG and hagatha has no active hero power as well as being hand restrictive AND completely RNG as well.
---
Just pay a little attention whenever you are spending money lol
---
Nope, the deck has even less threats now. It's even more of a grinder with Frightened Flunky. Turns out that card, while being pretty good, failed at making Taunt Warrior a thing and instead provided yet another OP value-generator to ResidentSleeper Warrior. 
---
Bomb Warrior has all the weaknesses of Control Warrior while not actually doing anything better than the deck anymore because there's more forms of healing in decks vying for the top, so it seems like Bomb Warrior has been ditched for pure ResidentSleeper style warrior. 
---
I'm kind of worried for the meta. I assumed Quest Druid was going to be shit because it gets stomped on by aggro but we may be entering a polarized rock-paper-scissors meta-game because the decks that beat Quest Druid are more likely to lose to ResidentSleeper Warrior.
---
Just popping in to say I made the same stupid mistake on my EU account and Blizzard also swapped the packs out for me.
---
Great change of policy by them, I am truly appreciative!
---
P2W expansion
---
Crafting is one of the few things that actually works. Even newer games do a worse job at that.
---
Lol
---
Nice! Me too~ got sick of the meta and decided I'd give it a try 
---
What's your main? Got any legendaries from SOU
---
Im fine with conj. calling its a finite value. You can also counter it somehow with removal of the giant or something else...  
---
But Dr. Boom is freaking OP and evryone and their granny knows it
---
The card isn't reactive, but changing it three days into a new expansion because of the early numbers sure would be.
---
The card says "Battlecry: Deal 1 damage to all enemy minions. Overload: (1)". When the card is played the battlecry triggers which overloads you for 1. So if the battlecry triggers twice, i thought it should overload the player twice.
---
It seems strange to me that it didn't happen this way.
---
It does
---
I mean, on one hand most of the big counters like BGH, naturalize, and a few other things have gone away, but aggro has gotten more aggressive starts.
---
Then again you can curve out the first 3-4 turns with decent bodies now that generate cards on battlecry as well so it's not like you can't be getting some 2/3's or 3/2's out as mage to trade a bit the first few turns.
---
The deck is doing pretty well, I got from rank 9 to 4 so far (I used it interchangeably with quest rogue which I also find fun) and its definitely a good deck in slower quest meta. It even did well against quest shaman which seems like it will be new king of the meta. So far I had no time to push and test it on higher ranks, so that test is still ahead of me.
---
As of spellbreker, I will propably add one copy to improve matchups against value decks once the meta settles, but for now I think people are experimenting too much for silence to be needed.
---
As of impbalimg, I think silence is better than removal in this deck because of tempo, and also because 3 worthless imps will seriously damage your topdeck ability, especially when one draw generating a 4/4 lackey could win you the game.
---
Happened to me, the big minion with divine shield dropped. I hitted it thinking I was killing him only to realize he had divine shield all along.
---
I'm kind of surprised Tekahn isn't on here, running full Lackey package with Glinda is actually fairly powerful, even without him. With him you turn from Zoo to Midrange, almost.
---
You jerks can't even give these dumb threads a WEEK after the expansion? Really?
---
Christ destroys this combo, and also normal jade druids, and it's also pretty good against many other decks (although not insta win like against those 2)
---
I don't see what Zephrys has to do with this, but okay.
---
&gt;Rogue consistently can get this shit done by turn 3. 
---
This is absolutely not true.
---
The only problem I've had so far was when I didn't realize the minion had divine shield.
---
It was a new card to so I wasn't familiar with it and didn't realize it until I had wasted a few minions.
---
I assume we'll receive the next quests each wednesay? I'm confused too
---
In one situation with 7 mana i played doomsayer into zephrys hoping to get frost nova which I did.  
---
Next time in a similar situation I got mark of the wild.
---
This.
---
If the mage is running [[Mana Cyclone]] and [[Magic Trick]], there's not a chance of seeing less than 3 Frost Novas while they fish for answers.
---
It's either 308 milion or 3.08 billion, not sure if I counted correctly. Still much more likely that I had anticipated it to be.

---
So you tied then? Surely that went to the turn limit.
---
"Or a pick a" took me a while too
---
If it can indeed do that, I’m inclined to agree with you. My point is i don’t have solid data on whether it can.
---
But is shaman the best? I find Warrior and Mage to be way better in the end game. Only Murloc Shamy is reallllly strong but that deck is just about as much fun as sucking rusty nails.
---
&gt;Why can't they release expansions at a set price again?!
---
Because they need warm bodies filling 4 different servers, 24/7 across 4 different game modes. 
---
If you don't incentivize people to play every day, then they will have less people playing.
---
Long queue times cause a death spiral for a multiplayer game.
---
Consistently turn 3? The deck doesn't run enough activators for that and even if they do, a lot of the cards that help their Quest are simply bad cards. Clever Disguise would never be run outside of a Quest deck and it's only run because it gets the Quest half way there. Pharaoh Cat looks like a good card but you're playing it off curve and it has a low chance of getting you a class card. The new rush get a random minion card is mediocre, Blink Fox blanks vs Rogues, and to make matters worse the reward is something that's optimal in a high tempo aggressive deck and you're encouraged to run more value oriented cards and 1 and 2 mana do nothing garbage that relies on pure RNG to give you an edge. The more consistent you make it, the less aggressive it gets but the more aggressive you make it, the less consistent it gets. You'll highroll sometimes and yeah, it still does Rogue things so it can definitely win but at the end of the day I don't think it's a deck that can seriously compete with the new power level introduced in SoU.
---
For consistency's sake you would have to.
---
Have you forgotten one of the best cards in Evolve Shaman is Thing From Below? Mogu Fleshshaper would also be good in that deck.
---
Why even bring up Twinspell and Echo? They are different mechanics in the same way as Flashback and Storm in MTG.
---
Feels bad, man. :(
---
Oh. Overread it also.
---
Even without Dr.Boom, Warrior would still beat the hell out of all the aggro-decks and every meme-decks thanks to armor, taunts, value, removals, boardclears.
---
You are wrong!
---
Will look wich one suits me the best, thanks!
---
Jokes and human stupidity aside this was an interface design error.
---
You should either have no pack pre-selected and force the user to choose or you should have the latest pack pre-selected since this would be the most popular.
---
Bobby needs more money.
---
I had over 11,000 gold actually.
---
Here is proof: [https://imgur.com/a/WNBTm9t](https://imgur.com/a/WNBTm9t)
---
It's Reynad.  Wrong everything.
---
I am aready concerned this expansion will drive a highly polarized meta (matchup and draw determine majoirty of game outcomes.) 
---
Would be very bad, imo.
---
There is a deck nobody knows about yet and that is hybird secret hunter with 0 mana rhinos for charging zuljin beasts. I have tested all hunters so far, highlander, midrange, bomb but this deck just wrecks all slow decks like warriors, while having game aggainst aggro as well. basically it regular secret hunter with second win con.
---
I think a lot of the deck comes down to the mulligan and what to keep and what to get rid of. I've had good success with the deck, and even I think that my mulligan will only get better as I get used to the other decks people are running.
---
Zephrys doesn't consider upgraded hero power, so if the hero power is required for lethal then it is necessary to do it first before playing Zephrys. Hopefully they will fix this.
---
Gz
---
If you told me shaman would have the most powerful legendaries a couple years ago I would have laughed and then be sad as shaman used to be my favorite class
---
It was a tough decision, but Elise is just so much cooler with the map shuffling, nto to mention that Golden Monkey effect. That was my favourite thing to do in Hearthstone for a long time. Compared to that "just" healing to full is mediocre.
---
Note that I wasn't taking power, popularity or competitiveness into consideration. Just how much the card blew my mind when I first saw it.
---
I was all prepared to not play my highlander cards against bomb warrior, knowing they wouldn't activate. But I fought this battle cry shaman running the 5-mana neutral bomb card and needless to say, completely wasted my highlander Elise lol.
---
I would be shocked if they nerfed it months before rotation like Patches. Patches was at least part of a Tier 1 Wild deck in Pirate Warrior. Blizzard nerfed him as they were concerned about his long term effects in Wild. In contrast, Dr Boom Mad Genius is practically non-existent in Wild.
---
Funny thing is. Even Dr. Boom cannot defeat Dr. Boom. Only fatigue can determine the fate of such an ungodly duel
---
Hand disruption exists in HS though (you can argue the randomness hurts it but at the same time you can have multiple copies of everything in magic which sorta offsets this), what was being discussed is instant speed interaction with the combo as it triggers.
---
How many copies of Dire Frenzy in that deck?
---
No, they look different, not *totally* different. 
---
They are both translucent, cyan ellipses. That's pretty easy to see why people could confuse them at a glance.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOZBU257ERE
---
Huge missed opportunity
---
It's pretty popular and strong rn. It plays the 4 mana spell that draws you a minion and a spell and swaps their cost. The deck is full of murlocs and only 4 spells. 2 prism and 2 8 mana summon 7 murlocs from your deck. You can thin your deck out pretty consistently so u can finish off with either zephrys or nomi (if you havent already won the game). Pretty cancer lol but its only day 2 there could be more cancer coming...
---
Do you mind posting which deck you used? I never do well with these.
---
I agree with your two proposed changes of limiting which mechs get rush and changing the discover to a random addition.  I might extend the giving of rush to all minions in the deck.  
---
In any case, I think those two changes take the edge off the power level without changing the character of the card or the play-style much.
---
That said, when cards make decks utterly dominant, Blizzard has a history of not just doing minor nerfs, but instead just nuking the card entirely.
---
Shaman had multiple bad legendaries early on as well, so I don’t see your point.
---
if its consistently under 20 minutes in a mirror match its probably not  a control deck tbh
---
Other colors in Magic absolutely have meaningful instant speed disruption, whether it's forcing discard, killing the target of a spell or ability in response, making something untargetable in response, exiling cards from the deck or graveyard, etc. And unlike in Hearthstone, any deck can run blue in addition to it's other colors if it desperately needs the counter-magic; Force of Will is the reason practically every Vintage deck at least splashes blue (well, that and Ancestral+Time Walk).
---
I've just gotten used to those cards all looking like some prismatic oil spill with varying health/attack.
---
There's nothing in this expansion that even comes close to the amount of infinite value Boom puts out. Quest Shaman seems solid, but it still runs out of steam eventually and actually requires a buildaround. His winrate alone speaks for itself. Even in the early days of an expansion, a card should not have 70% win rate.
---
Wallwock &gt; LinecrackerBEEEES!!!  ?
---
Someone missed Mystery Inc.
---
Class legendary that's brings a new archetype = bad
---
Boring expansion that didn't add new archetypes = bad
---
New archetypes that make you craft two niche epics and make you spend more in the other archetypes = bad
---
Neutral Legendaries that are strong in non aggro decks = bad
---
Niche neutral legendary that's sorta worth the craft but makes you craft other legendary or epics for another decks = bad
---
So, what's your solution for the paywall?
---
It's just boring. 10 hours of armoring up, playing mechs and hard aoe any board. I like control but I still enjoy having fun
---
And I thought these effortless “meme” bullshit posts had stopped after Uldum released
---
I must've misread because from what the tweet I recall said, it used all the information available to *you* at that point (so your hand, deck outside of generated cards, the board state, and the hand and deck sizes).
---
Zephrys only offers Basic and Classic cards, friend. The anti-secret tech in these two sets is only Flare.
---
I think in general a single secret might not be worth addressing most of the time, but the way it works right now it's basically saying "let's assume that one secret doesn't matter right now". A lot of the time it won't, sometimes it will. Zephrys is supposed to give you the *perfect* answer for the situation - when that situation includes a secret, you can't just assume it will never matter, it's well worth it to pivot and have *one* of *three total* answers to the overall situation be tailored for the secret. It's a distinct enough part of the board and gameplay.
---
Nail. Head.
---
Lackeys are very powerful 1-drops with battlecries that you can't put in your deck directly. You can only generate them through other cards.
---
Really unlikely? A slight understatement.
---
Link for the decklists?
---
&gt; You just dont play them. 
---
Until Y'Shaarj decides you do.
---
You are forgetting the odds of a spell killing yogg and also mindgames pulling exactly Mech’Thun
---
&gt;forcing discard
---
Dirty rat...
---
&gt;killing the target of a spell or ability in response
---
This is usually responded to by just repeating the loop depending on the combo (since oftentimes one or more parts can be played first if its of a card type the opponent's colors can't beat)
---
&gt;exiling cards from the deck or graveyard
---
Also exists in HS.
---
How is it still a strong her power? He costs 7 mana. You're basically never rushing in anything more than a 1/3 or a 3/3 at best in this case. It might as well not have the line at all if this is the case.
---
It's the quest I got. Literally the only quest I absolutly didn't want because of how obviously trash it is. I think I'll take a break for a few weeks.
---
I was talking about lategame decks. And I'm pretty sure I stated that you had either otk lategame or aggro decks (yeah token druid en zoolock are archetypes of aggro decks). Fact is I stopped playing a while ago as I found the game becoming more and more shifting towards heavy RNG and otk decks but kept watching competitive scene as an esport fan overall. And it seems that the meta is stuck into these aggro Vs otk / instant win condition decks.  We'll see but there is a lot of chances this xpac won't change anything about it. The standard rotation could've helped them to reduce the powercreep a lot, but for some reason they keep adding some.
---
Oh ok, I know nobody else will read this, but it is still weird you would edit your paragraph of a response to be more rediculous
---
I don’t get hoe people can defend this card at this point.
---
Thalnos could work if you got him or you could drop in a serpent egg. Werpent egg works great with grim rally
---
Reread what I put in the brackets.
---
Control war vs Control war is the worst.  I would always just surrender then waste my whole day.
---
Value
---
Also hitting the spells in the correct order increases the odds of 203 million by a bit as well
---
r/4PanelCringe
---
I don't know that raising the mana cost actually makes what it does feel any more fair. They can just highroll you one turn later, which is still really difficult to deal with.
---
I think they should make it summon one minion instead. Better removal, and it still works as a heal / making a Battlecry minion a better body.
---
no they’re saying that zeph himself cannot grant you a bounce effect. You can choose to include them in your deck, but zeph won’t give you one,
---
He's jumping out of his own skin!
---
Is freeze mage really that good right now?
---
It's not a normal 1 cost minion. You play understatted minions like [[EVIL cable rat]], and get a lackey as a reward.
---
Quest Paladin feels extremely strong. Got 11-3 in the Brawliseum with it.
---

2/1/1 Beast | Battlecry: Add a Lackey to your hand.  
---
If it was a card you could craft and put in your deck, it would be. But lackeys are generated by other cards.
---
I want to make a control quest shaman as well. Seems like it could be very strong.
---
I rather play any of those decks anyday anytime than the 30+ removal warrior.
---
Seems impractical for an explorer/archaeologist. But this is Warcraft, home of 3 feet high shoulderpads.
---
Did they just concede?
---
I'd argue that Scargill, Zentimo, Vessina, Krag'wa and Al'Akir are all on a similar level to Myra, Face Collector, Voss and Gral.
---
All very niche and don't really fit into the big, current, meta decks. Only good when randomly gained through other cards. Hagatha is a kinda dead card now too considering how powerful the quest reward is compared to her HP.
---
Tell me about it. Warrior games play out exactly the same regardless of what class they are playing. Every turn is identical to last game from turn 1 to turn 35.
---
I honestly don't get how kids have fun running it. other control decks have different options to make as well actual decisions to make
---
I think the problem isn't just Dr Boom, it's the fact their control is so powerful they can keep Mad Genius in their opening against everything. The infinite value and tempo of Dr Boom is a problem because there's nothing that kills them before they get there. The class has the 2 best 1 drops in the game, the best rush minions, the 2 best AoE spells (arguably Earthquake is up there as well). The best 5 drop, best single target  removal in shield slam, best 4 drop removal and 1 mana card generation whose downside of only playable on 10 is irrelvant because Warrior has no issue getting there. They can afford to run whatever tech cards they need to shore up their weakest matchups whilst still stomping aggro. Need elysianna and brewmaster? Sure put it in there. Need mechathun package? Go for it! Need Owl and BGH? Why not! Historically the decks that could run whatever the fuck they wanted were OP ones (like pre nerf Druid) that had little fear of dying to anything.
---
Seriously. It came down to fatigue and I barely won with 1 health left.
---
Its GMs are awesome
---
All gold is money
---
W... what? What minion? There is no minion in Basic or Classic that removes secrets.
---
I can't and I'm on Android, but I use the one from the Amazon Appstore (for coins), maybe that's why?
---
Yes, because Pirate Warrior killing a Doomsayer on turn 2, and Aggro Shaman / Pirate Warrior as the only consistent Tier 1 decks was clearly the pinnacle of Hearthstone. 
---
It's almost like people on the subreddit prefer a balance in the meta.
---
I play taunt warrior and it is amazing. Have about 80% win rate with it so far.
---
Don't forget discover has class bonus so they can roll more 8 mana double mech taunts.
---
It's basically a waste of time after certain turns because they just remove/block everything.
---
It's intentional buddy.
---
Your fault priest is gay
---
In classic warrior ran like 8 legendaries. Control warrior back then was so damn annoying.
---
I very much doubt Team 5 is really considering an emergency ban of Dr. Boom, Mad Genius.
---
Plus, it is better when the hammer of card changes is only used when there is firm evidence the relative scalpel of new cards proves ineffective so decks aren't needlessly killed.
---
Vulpera art are so amazing in this exp. Im lovin it.
---
So basically what I read was "waaaaa DR Boom beat quest priest, please nerf"
---
will he work the same in wild
---
Bye Felicia
---
With the popularity of the internet the first is becoming less and less true...
---
His face reminds me of the devil from Rick and Morty. Nicely done.
---
Every time I go to clear an early board I expect him to give me a hellfire instead he gives me shadow flame. Saving that 3 life is nice against aggro.
---
&gt;Dr Boom requires just as much buildaround as Quest Shaman.
---
LOL wow.
---
Iron Juggernaut was very novel
---
To be fair, I haven’t seen zentimo or krag’wa in a minute.
---
Imagine if it worked that way. I would for sure play this card to try a weird deathrattle combolock in wild.
---
The drawback, ofcourse, is that your opponent also gets their deathrattles and you are closer to fatigue (which is arguably worse for warlock).
---
And you would struggle to use non-deathrattle cards that synergize with deathrattles (N’zoth, Undatakah)
---
It actually sounds cool.
---
That's really cool man, I've made mistakes in the past, I thought nothing could be done lol
---
I played several games with Whizbang's Hunter Quest deck. It's a lot better than I thought. There're so many ways to generate tokens even after quest completion. The quest is a bit too slow though and I might just got lucky in these few games.
---
***INFINITE FULL-BOARD DINOMANCER EVENLOCK GANG***
---
Oh, definitely. But I hope this interaction doesn't get changed because I think it's hilarious, and not meaningfully different from any other combo that wins the game i.e. mechathun or exodia mage or uther DK.
---
It's perhaps more frustrating and I expect it to garner negative attention because instead of just winning it essentially forces the person playing it to concede, and people are a prideful and spiteful bunch and are going to waste their own time trying to play this out. Unless they think they can get to a draw, which is fair enough.
---
To track your cards, you can use DeckTracker, and it'll record your stats as well on PC and Android as well (on mobile, hard to link)
---
...how does somebody make it to legend and fall for that? It’s not even like it was close...
---
I didn't ask to be brought into this world, dad!
---
He was chilling, asking for nothing but being alone, and this crappy old god’s minion summons him. He deserved this.
---
Update ?
---
That’s perfectly fine, though?
---
Until you get the one that makes your opponent’s cards cost (1) less.
---
Been playing around with it a little. Feels a little cheap to play, though. The requirements aren't that interesting but the reward is pretty decent. It kind of feels like playing Jaraxxus in a Warrior package.
---
 I think the power lies in understanding that this a tempo oriented way of playing. Trade aggressively, play to the board and valuetrade where possible. Those 4/3's suck removal while you keep the board clear with weapons.
---
I've been playing Kripp's version and enjoyed it decently and had decent success getting to rank 5. By no means an S tier deck, but still rather fun to play.
---
I mean, I doubt people need that much help remembering what was generated through hero power and what wasn’t, but maybe the cards could glow in the same way rush does on the board, while in hand?
---
A slight (albeit inelegant) nerf would be that friendly mechs have rush and  -1 / -1 stats until the end of the turn you played them. Still very strong, but would slightly temper the power level.
---
Throwing out a rat before the warrior gets 6 mana to possibly turn an auto lose into a chance of winning feels worthwhile. And it can be usable in the mirror to kill their combo after yours is done. Idk if it’s worth a deckslot though, some edge cases for sure.
---
The complete deck feature uses statistics and data to complete decks, finding cards that are commonly used with the cards already in your deck.
---
There just has not been that much data collected yet to really make it work with Saviors of Uldum cards.
---
I would give it a few more days. They need to collect data about how the new cards are used.
---
Only rivaled by prep coin concede

I hope they don’t nerf this card so that it is completely useless in wild, it already isn’t very strong. I have even been beating Warrior with highlander secret hunter, the matchup never feels as bad to me as it does to everyone who spams these posts, I do play warrior but I have been exclusively playing big warrior, as it actually runs enough threats to beat elysiana, as long as the final card isn’t [[dimensional ripper]]
---
I get thst in standard it's strong. But it only has 8 months left in standard, why ruin a card that is alrwady weak in wild when it's lived most of its life in standard. It can easily be rotated like genn, Baku, vanish, mind blast. If they can rotate those, the best solution long term is rotating. Nerfing is a short term gain for long term loss.

Nice. Two wishes.

Razvan #2540 EU online now trading 80g quest , you go first
---
Gotta say it's especially demoralizing trying to play a brand new highlander deck with 2+ bombs shuffled into it :-/
---
HOW LONG ⛏ CAN THIS ⛏ GO ON ⛏
---
Your point being?
---
This town aint big enough for both of us.
---
Just remove Omega Devastator's Mech tag. I literally think that would be enough.
---
I suggest reading it again then, my arguments are backed up by data.
---
Not really a puzzle but still a Nice lethal
---
This is how it was with Odd Warrior back in the day too.  Deathstalker Rexxar made it so you never ran out of stuff, but you'd still only be playing one minion per turn, so they could remove your minion while ahead on board and you couldn't catch up.
---
He got it from faceless lackey.

80g quest trade on EU,

---
I'll show but you go first.
---
It's sad that you are okay with a game with as many interactions and strategies as hearthstone being boiled down to something as brain dead as rock paper scissors.
---
You don't draw them all at once. Omega Devastator is only usable at turn 10. Current CW doesn't run Execute either. 
---
You don't have infinite removals in hand as Control Warrior, so there is decisions to make. Especially against Token Druid, Mage and Hunter force you to make tough decisions, and often against Hunter and Mage it can be totally hopeless too.
---
/r/hearthstone: KotFT was the best expansion ever!

Hero cards are just always going to be problematic. This is not a Boom-specific problem, this is many of the Death Knights as well. The fact is that an uninteractable engine of repeated value and tempo is never going to be healthy. It seems weird to me to single out Boom for this fundamental principle, but, it is the only Hero that hits those checkboxes in Standard, so I can see why.
---
In an ideal world, Blizz won't return to hero cards. I know they're fun, I personally adore FLJ, but they warp the game considerably in a way that just can't be good or healthy.
---
Happened to me today, had a EVIL Recruiter waiting for next turn :(
---
Nothing worse until you think you’ve run them out of removal then they double omega assembly, discover a mech, and now they have 7 rush minions and still have 6 mana
---
I think the Warrior Quest can also beat Control Warrior.  Not sure though.  But it is a higher-value hero power than Boom's.
---
I know it is a personal risks but Reno was such a big deal when he is released. Everyone loved it so much that they shoehorned him into a lot of decks when he was first released (Control Warrior or Freeze Mage with Reno).
---
If Rogue had been suppressing a bunch of value decks, then Warrior would have gotten weaker (it did, kind of, with Bomb Hunter and Mage rising up).  But Rogue was suppressing other aggro decks as well, so the greedy decks didn't get a second wind.
---
Yeah, and the orange eyes really "pop" even when it's in your hand.
---
Valid point, however I think you are underestmating how strong Delivery Drone is after the mech buff patch. It it would outvalue som Quest Hero Powers even if Rush were removed, but I haven’t tested it so can’t say for sure.
---
Don't forget coin mountain giant
---
Wouldn't rely on that data this early in the release
---
[deleted]
---
I did this combo against an exodia mage. He never passed my Armor.
---
I just hate the rng aspect of the card. It seems like whenever I go up against control warrior they always get the 7 armor right when I’m about to finish them off. And they always, ALWAYS have a fucking omega devastator.
---
"Overload: (X)" is technically its own keyword ability, it's just listed after the Battlecry text.
---
Haven't had the pleasure. Ditto battlecry shamman.
---
You know what? Feel free to point out where I allegedly made those statements.
---
Glad they did!
---
It can work pretty well. You have to play it like a token deck that can function well without the quest to reliably complete it and capitalize on it. Any deck that focuses on anything but tokens and token synergy is gonna suck. It came pretty easy to me because I was running Halazzi token hunter before the quest released and it seems like it was purpose built for this style of deck. 
---
The quest is more of an extra tool to give you the reach to close out longer games than the main focus. I hit quite a few 30+ damage rhino combos with the hero power and often tempo them out before the quest, but it's still early so nobody is running good decks yet. It also has a shitload of board refill and people will often run out of removal trying to run you ourlt of gas. Cult master is absolutely insane with the deck. 
---
There's definitely something there and I think it has the potential to be a solid c tier deck that can often catch people off guard, but it's hard to say if it will survive when the meta settles. Hyena Alpha is questionable since there's only one decent secret for the deck, but it's crazy strong if you can get it off and you run the secret as a two of anyways so it seems like it might belong.

Quest shaman: put good battlecry minions in your deck and then good shaman cards in your deck (earthquake, thunderhead overload package etc). 
---
Dr Boom: put good mech minions in your deck and good warrior removal cards
---
If boom gets nerfed you guys are just going to complain about the next best thing. Thats just what reddit does.
---
I also did not get a quest yesterday, or today.
---
On release date I had three active quests.  One deleted and was replaced with the expansion quest to play 100 cards.  I completed that and since then, the third slot has not refilled.
---
Update: 37/41 wins now, hit rank 2, not sure why people disliked the deck, oh well lol.
---
Mage literally has one good deck right now. And cc is only totally op against decks that have to control the board.
---
For a while it was used in some tempo rogue variants, but it didn't lasted long. Prince 3 was good in cubelock and keleseth was a centerpiece of tempo rogue (the best deck of kft meta after jade druid) and heal zoolock.
---
But yeah, prince 4 was better than expected but still bad
---
There should be plenty of data at this point. Blizzard should be logging EVERY match ever played and would have much more than HSReplay.
---
&gt;no where ear as format warping as either Genn or Baku.
---
We're only a couple days into the expansion, but right now Control Warrior looks more meta warping than Odd Paladin, you're just wrong about that. Here's my take on the situation - if Quest Druid ends up being meta, Control Warrior needs to be nerfed. It's that simple - Quest Druid is so slow that the only way it could ever be meta is if the game is broken. 
---
We'll see. I'm holding out some hope - there's a lot of interesting cards and lists to be refined. We'll see what happens though.
---
&gt; The only stinker was the Paladin quest of old,
---
Just like the Paladin quest of new!
---
It seems like he's bugged into thinking your hero power is still available - those options all give you lethal if Steady Shot hadn't been used yet. Of course offering Fireball would negate that issue, but Zephrys seems to prefer "perfect" solutions rather than overkill. For now it's probably best to hold off on using your hero power until after playing Zephrys, it's public knowledge so he's already able to consider it.
---
Well there's your problem. Maybe you'll figure it out.
---
Judging by your downvotes it's also not only my problem!
---
Those are not very good counters.
---
Hope you reported him. People don’t realize this kind of language is unhealthy and is unacceptable in the gaming community.  Grats on the win ;-)
---
I haven't played Hearthstone in a long time, but I'd like to step in here.
---
If you nerf the giants, you're just doing more damage to the basic/core set, and increasing reliance on the increasingly powercreeped expansions.
---
Well when all the death knights were in standard they either had to nerf like 4 or 5 of them or nerf none
---
Looks to me like the person with the biggest board here actually lost.
---
They didn’t look too promising anyways maybe the will get more support soon
---
Meh...there's really nothing stopping them from mechanically reusing the concept of **Magnetic** and just coming up with a new term if they want to implement it for a new tribe. Maybe **Mating** or something for Beasts, for instance; it could be mechanically the same while still offering its own flavor.
---
Previous expansion, every class was viable except for Warlock and Priest. Even those 2 were not absolute trash.
---
In current meta it's almost the same. Every class is viable for climbing and besides that...
---
&gt;Tier 1: Overperforming Archetypes  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Winrate within one standard deviation of the strongest archetype.  
---
&gt;📷[Control Warrior59.54%](https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/2/control-warrior)  
---
&gt;📷[Murloc Paladin58.36%](https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/157/murloc-paladin)
---
Oh my god, Warrior has 1% higher winrate than second more powerful deck, how oppressive!
---
Making it to legend isn't necessarily an indication of skill.  Choose any auto-pilot deck with a +50% win rate and commit the time.
---
I think it's less about Dr Boom and more about the fact that they printed broken mechs that go perfectly with him AND discover mechanics that almost guarantee that the warrior picks up more. The only way warrior really loses is if they dont get a Devestator or Light the Fuses off of their original discover 3 mechs (twice) or they don't roll the hero power. Warrior wins because it has too much value in the end and because they have unprecedented early-game board control with their rush minions and an incredibly cheap way to tutor them out. They have no weakness beyond OTK decks that can hit for more than 50
---
I would prefer to see Omega Devastator at 5 or 6 mana, and Light the Fuses at 6. I also think this is more likely than changing individual numbers on Dr Boom, since Blizzard has a perogative to keep changes simple and easy to recognize. 
---
Alternatively, if you want to break everything but still make him powerful, change his text to "For the rest of the game, your Mechs have Magnetic"
---
Dont you disrespect my man Silverback.  Best 3-drop in the game
---
I think the armor gain is what I really have the most trouble with. 7 armor just like that, and then repeatable with hero power? And then discover a minion or deal 3 dmg in someway after that? The moment Dr. Boom goes up I am on the defensive. I have started to just concede when he gets played because my resources are usually almost spent trying to counteract the other 29 cards in the deck.
---
A clip where Thijs isn't getting wrecked? I didn't know such videos existed.
---
This happens literally every expansion. People want to play the new decks. They're unrefined so they arent that good. The old good decks though are still pretty good. This isnt a control warrior issue this is a people expecting to win with not good decks issue.
---
Wow! I was wondering what card this was before I read the title.
---
I'm gonna have to politely hard-disagree with ya there bud. Blackhowl Gunspire, Akali the Rhino, The Boom Reaver, and War Master Voone aren't seeing play in tier 1/tier 2 decks.
---
Even Darius isn't seeing play in Warrior like he used to. The Boomship used to see play in a Mechathun warrior, who knows if that will resurface. Armagedillo is seeing some experimentation, so that's up in the air.
---
I'd actually go so far as to say that on average Warriors legendaries have been pretty bad, really.
---
3 legendaries in my first 12 packs! This is the luckiest i've been :)
---
It's a bug, make sure you have at least two slots open for tommorow... The last slot is locked
---
Unfun to play against is such a vague and baseless criticism that it basically means nothing. If a deck is good, it's unfun to play against. If a deck is common, it's unfun to play against. If a deck beats them, it's unfun to play against.
---
Np
---
david#19897 NA trading 80g you first
---
All my old decks are non viable after this expansion not just my C'thun deck bro. I'm saying if you want to stand a chance in ladder your gonna need some packs from the new expansion just to keep up. Unless you play big priest like usual that broken af.
---
"The perfect card" is the one with the most elaborate BM, of course. That's why you only "Almost" lost it. Zephrys knew this would happen.

Please don't nerf, just HoF him like Genn &amp; Baku. In wild he isn't not nearly oppressive and it would be sad to lose a good Hero in wild. He's the sole reason to play Mech Warrior in wild.

Gotta say it did evaporate my enthusiasm for the expansion within the first evening. There are just enough warriors around, and each game takes 25 minutes, to make the fun games in between seem not worth it. See you at Xmas I guess. F.
---
Haha got you :) That means a lot... seems like my work making some progress. Thanks!
---
I would wait for now to see what decks rise to the top in a couple weeks. If dust really isn't a problem then I suggest crafting cards you wanted from older sets. The reason is you still get Saviors of Uldum packs by playing arena and any upcoming promotions would most likely going to feature Uldum packs.
---
Let's hope it doesnt give adventure only cards
---
Needs more flames
---
I love that we just got a new expansion, but the biggest problem is a year-old card. At least we can't complain about power creep?
---
This needs to be nerfed.
---
I’m guessing that it will be like dalaran heist, giving cardpacks
---
It's honestly pretty bad. People just hyping the shit out of it because kripp made a vid. Might want to add that it was like his fifth "STRONGEST NEW DECK!!!1!" video within a week...
---
Infinite value.
---
Actually I decided to try Questing Explorer a bit to understand your side and I think you might be right. At the very least I seem to prefer it over Pharaoh Cat.
---
*Nasa wants to know your location*
---
Dunno, just speculating!
---
This is correct, there are more quests coming leading into the solo adventure.
---
Zilliax will rotate out April 2020.
---
If you can’t nerf cards because it doesn’t hold up to the INSANE poser level in Wild, Stadard balance is goong to be very shit. 
---
This might be controverdial, but I think you can’t habe ot both ways. You can’t balance the same cards for two completely different metas. And if they have to prioritize, I’d rather have a too weak Boom in Wild, than a broken Boom in standard.
---
If you’re sick about seeing rage about warrior then why the fuck are you commenting on an anti-warrior thread? Obviously a refined deck is gonna be better than my shit. I think that mentality is boring because everyone else is trying new garbage decks and having fun. Try-harding at the start of the expansion is problem here, not necessarily warrior.
---
I agree...I really love highlander decks but there is just no fun in it.
---
Yes, yes, yes. But WHO is going to spend time doing that? No one is getting paid.
---
The only good cards I can think of are for hunter. Masters Call, Zuljin, Shimmerfly. Even then they had some janky stuff like the discover a spell while holding a weapon. Almost every spirit was a meme except for Shaman and maybe rogue. Paladin is probably the second best one and that doesnt even see play. Overkill flopped completely. Not even oondasta was good enough. I was so certain that Druid would be cheating out big beasts with Stampeding Roar and Oondasta...that never happened. 
---
Forgot about Shirvallah and Time out, which both see play in a pretty decent OTK deck.
---
Lots of potential for the set but it definitely fell short.
---
“Weee’re gonna have 6 bombs in our deck!”
---
Oh right. *that* card. Ugh.
---
druid quest could be nerfed to "leave 12 mana crystals unspent" instead of X amount of turns with mana left unspent. 
---
this way, if druid players want to, they can accelerate their quest development at the cost of playing fewer cards/hero powers and complete it on turn 5 (2 + 3 + 4 + 3). this limits the amount of mana they can spend early game to only 2 mana if they want the quest up by turn 5.
---
however, if they have to spend mana in the early turns to counteract aggressive strategies, this will delay their quest development appropriately, perhaps only completing the quest on turns 7-8 rather than on turn 5.
---
Yep exactly. I don’t want nerfs to decks just because people find it unfun to lose.
---
Thanks! So i should get him?:)
---
That's why I love it! No one expects warrior too push 22 face damage
---
&gt; It's not ever the best class in the fucking game right now
---
Thats not the point. The point is that it is both top tier AND miserably unfun to play against AND it means that no other control decks can see play.
---
There is more to an online game than just power level.
---
Looks like all quests are bad after all. Tempo Rogue will replace Quest Rogue and Aggro Shaman will replace Quest Shaman. Rest is already nonexistent.
---
What he says is true but I would craft it anyway. Zilliax has a 70% usage and can fit into most decks
---
[removed]
---
"Engaging TC-130 Mental...."
---
Opponent: FFFFFUUUUUUU \*concede\*
---
It’s a 45 minute expansion ruining skill free time sink. Well done Blizz.
---
I would say check out “old guardian” on YouTube. Hes got some budget decks and does most meta decks as well.
---
Zephyr is proof that the catchup logic exists for the AI, and it's drawing what it needs.
---
He just pointed out that the only card he had 2 of was Zephrys.
---
I agree that something has to be done about Dr. Boom and Conjurer's Calling, but I am against nerfing Boom because he is already extremely fringe in Wild (only sees play in Odd Warrior and that deck is around Tier 3) and nerfing him would basically remove him from Wild forever.
---
Boom cannot compete with DK Gul'Dan/Jaina and Rexxar so making him even weaker would be a huge blow to anyone interested in playing slow Warrior decks in Wild and those are already almosr non-existant.
---
I much prefer a Hall of Fame treatment because that way we solve the Standard issue and keep him unchanged in Wild where he is not this huge threat that wins games by itself, just a piece of the puzzle.
---
Woah, I said it cause I thought it would actually work like that, not because of a streamer.
---
My stupidity is my own thank you.
---
Tavern brawl isn't the place to do it this week. But I feel you dude. I'm playing a Homebrew Highlander warrior on ladder right now, that's how I'm having fun.
---
To much work for blizz, sorry.
---
Thanks! He is great 💪
---
Us citizen by any chance?
---
What minion is between the mecharoo and bomb on your opponent’s board? And do you have any minions?
---
If minions on board can’t help with lethal, then as others have said it’s probably a hero power related bug
---
True, then that would mean that Brann probably has 2 big dinosaurs 🦖
---
[Hysteria just released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1GGnPIVNRg) featuring a bunch of situations where Zephrys isn't offering lethal.  I think the lack of offering silence and bloodlust were the only examples where it seems like it may be bugged/not functioning as intended. OP's example may be another.
---
It goes further than "number of cards that use it."  
---
Most key words have some kind of support around them.  What i mean by that is that cards *reference* these effects in some way. 
---
"Destroy a minion with taunt."  
---
"Your battlecries trigger twice."  
---
"Summon a random deathrattle minion"
---
Not only does enrage not *have* any support, it seems silly to build support around it.  Any time you might want to build support around the enrage mechanic, it makes more sense to simply build support around damaged minions in general.  Why make "Restore 3 health for each friendly enraged minion" when you could instead make "Restore 3 health for each friendly damaged minion?"  Why make "Destroy an enraged minion" instead of "Destroy a damaged minion?"
---
Sure, you could make "Summon a minion with 'enrage' from your deck,"  but it is probably more interesting to make, "Summon a minion from your deck. Deal 1 damage to it" and build your deck around making sure that the minion you get has a bonus from being damaged.
---
Inspire goes in 2nd place for "Least supported keyword," as no cards were printed that interact with that mechanic at all. How a "Your inspire effects trigger twice" legendary was never printed is beyond me.
---
Poisonous is an interesting one, because its existence is predicated almost entirely off of "Number of cards that use it."  it started out as not a keyword, but as Blizzard decided that they wanted to use more and more and more they decided to make it a keyword so that the flurry of "Give a X Poisonous" cards could be much more concise.  It is nice that this allowed them to make fun cards that say things like "Poisonous to heroes" and have people intuitively understand what it means. 
---
But again, it isn't just based on what support *exists*, it is based on whether building support even makes sense.  "Give your Poisonous minions divine shield" would be a great card that makes sense. "Give your Enraged minions divine shield" feels like it would be way clearer if it were simply "Give your damaged minions divine shield."
---
I'd usually agree that just because an aggro deck is good on the first week doesn't mean anything, but murloc pally is very powerful with Tip the Scales and Chef Nomi.
---
It took us a while to get there, but I'm glad it finally clicked. No, I did not.
---
Yeah sure of course you did

---
quest rogue can run pretty much everything tempo rogue does, but it has better late game. i think you are way off base here.
---
quest shaman is ridiculously good, but... there are different ways of building it. some with a focus on late game, others with early game. aggro shaman can get blown out by a single mass removal or poor draw. a problem quest shaman doesnt really have.
---
Called this day one that quest rewards were too low impact strictly because the value they bring will never keep up with the value of Boom who dominates and dictates the meta.
---
Quests are essentially deck building requirements, you have to at least play a handful of cards to progress the Quest, probably a handful of synergy cards to at least make some decent consistency alongside those.
---
Boom requires nothing, just put in your deck with 29 removals and bam, you win every value game, every Control game, and most aggro games.
---
Constructed will continue to be a snooze fest until Boom and Conjurers is gone.
---
YOU FACE JARAXXUS!
---
Oh hey, control warrior is good again for the first time since release. Let the warriors have their fun in the spotlight, they've missed it.
---

---
Starfire doesn't hit face, creatures only
---
"Consecrate would be great here? Oh, I guess holy nova is even better!" Thanks Zephyrs
---
It’s amazing how quickly people forget.. When Dr. Boom first came out many were pretty underwhelmed by the card because it absolutely paled in comparison to most of the Death Knights and the Genn &amp; Baku effects. It wasn’t very good until they all rotated out. It doesn’t make sense to nerf Dr. Boom, just HOF it along with the other remaining hero cards. I think most would agree it would be refreshing to have a meta with no hero cards at all. It’s a long shot Blizzard would actually do this, but personally I think it would be for the best.
---
Oh ok, I just wanna know what all the words mean so I can become more involved with the community, or at least understanding what trump means on his videos lol
---
And Zul'jin and Hagatha while we're at it. It seems like a complete afterthought that a few hero cards remained in game when the concept as a whole rotated out.
---
The fuck are you on about? Control Warrior costs 13,000 dust.
---
Poor people play hunter, most of whose decks are cheap as hell.
---
Lol yes you did. In response to previous comments those were your responses.
---
This was disappointing, not gonna lie.
---
I think it's time to let it go.
---
*laughs in wild*
---
Obviously I can't speak for everyone, but for me personally, Warrior's success rate isn't what makes me hate it. The play style is what makes me hate it. It feels like I'm playing against the ocean. Nothing I do matters. No card I play sticks (and if it does, it won't stick long enough to put a dent in their armor). The entire game can be summarized with "pray they don't draw the right cards." (Sounds similar to how people describe Big Priest in wild. I'm not a wild player but it sounds very similar.)
---
Sure, if the deck was less successful, we'd see far less of it and the problem wouldn't be as pronounced but it would still exist.
---
Fix the root problem, the overabundance of removal &amp; insane armor generation, and yes the deck will become less powerful but that doesn't just mean the next best deck will be equally boring to play against. In fact, every other deck in the meta right now is far more enjoyable to play against.
---
I'd much prefer a meta oppressed by summon mage, quest shaman, murloc paladin, or whatever else rises to the top. All those decks at least have to deal with your cards using strategy, not just "oh they played more stuff for me to remove."
---
I still don't understand why Bees works with overkill, isn't overkill triggering when the minion with Overkill attacks?
---
Not true,  Taunt truid with witching hour and cube was everywhere in the meta, it was just an easily counterable deck, so not top tier.  Undertaker helped the deck be more consistent (not needing Witching or cube, so they could run DK hero and spreading plague) allowing it to run over other midrange decks, and have a chance vs aggro.  Undertaker + Astral Tiger allowed them to have a chance vs the oppressive Control Warrior at the time as well.  Many decks had to adjust themselves to account for spreading plague/druid DK being back in the meta, while also having to deal with its infinite value.  A control warrior could only deal with it's wide and tall board with so many brawls/echo whirlwinds.
---
mill rogue before coldlight was rotated out.
---
You're thinking of [[Starfall]]. [[Starfire]] is a 6 mana deal 5 anywhere, which would have given OP lethal
---
I think it's awesome, you can just get a lot more of free stuff compared to just grinding ranked games.
---
Nope. It hits face. "Deal 5 damage. Draw a card."
---
You dont need a free turn when you have already stacked armor and have the most efficient removal in the game.
---
The amount of games where you have boom on 7 and cant play him are minuscule when looking at the big picture. Look at the mulligan and drawn winrates.
---
You don't have to be just as good as Chakki to be the final designer. He was one of the best players in the game at the time he was playing competitively, that's a pretty high bar.

Hey friend, I played a bit of dragon shaman on day 1 too and it felt really solid. Don't have Vulperas but what I did use was Mind Control Tech which felt great with how easy it is for people to generate huge boards. Could I trouble you to give it a test and see how it goes (or just count how many situations you are encountering where MCT might be better than Vulperas?) I won't get a chance to play more until next week but would love to have something to jump straight towards when I do.
---
[[springpaw]], [[headhunter's hatchet]] and [[master's call]] all see lots of action. Also [[revenge of the wild]] features in some quest decks now I've seen. 
---
Several neutrals also see play, murloc tastyfin is in every murloc deck e.g.
---
Edit: spelling
---
Decklist please.
---
Great high-effort post here. Bump this.
---
Boom needed a nerf since last season.
---
Are there any new decks that are really good vs control warrior?
---
Boom outvalues all other control decks.  Boom lets you run every tech needed vs aggro.
---
What exactly is going to develop in the meta that will make Boom a fair card?  Not trying to be inflammatory but despite an unsettled meta it's still a broken card (for standard) that invalidates many other decks.

Soul of the Forest (4 mana)

I actually ended up cutting one of the amalgams for am mct, and that felt much better
---
I'll add you my btag is maiora.
---
Kind of seems super unlikely to me but maybe some of them yeah.  But many are just playing it for the wins.  Now I don't fault people for playing a good deck even if I hate playing against it.  I fault blizz for printing a broken card that lets that deck exist.
---
What’s this deck consist of ? I haven’t got to play much
---
I've been having a good time with it. I just played a game where I played about 10 of the evolve lackeys, was hilarious turning 4 mana life drinkers into 8/8s the turn you play them. 
---
They can seriously burn through enemy removal, and there are quite a few different builds you can do. Did a highlander version for a bit with Zephrys, still might try to make it happen once I've calmed down from this lackey and direct damage insanity.
---
Boom is *barely* playable in Wild, nerfing him would be ridiculous. If he's such a massive problem in standard (which he most definitely isn't), just hall of fame him. 
---
Don't advocate the butchering of cards because you like to whine. Actually, you garbage players constantly whining for nerfs is getting ridiculously annoying. Should be permabanned off this subreddit.
---
Nope. All I did was poke fun at people for trying a little too hard.
---
You’ll pay for ur crimes
---
I've had a friend that had quest warrior practically built for him in under 10 packs :(
---
makes total sense. You also wouldnt get knife juggler shots for your opponents minions even if "you" summon them. It works like that with all summon cards
---
If they end up buffing cards from Rastakhan's Rumble in this xpac like they did with the Boomsday cards they should really make Void Contract cost like... 4 Mana. It could make some kind of Void Contract+ Jaraxxus + Elysiana/Impbalming Fatigue deck work where you tell the enemy control deck that they don't get 15 of their cards to deal with your infernals.
---
would be good for pala quest but yeah... didnt happen
---
Nothing is necessarily in place of him. I don't run a very greedy list, as I only run 1 Mechanical Whelp and no 7+ minions. My list is the fastest I've seen (I run 2 Crystology, 2 Call to Arms, and 1 Prismatic Lens), as my priority is quest activation. Making 2/2 eggs and whelps is great, but additional 2/2 of even the weaker reborn minions helps give you a sturdy board and begins the snowball to victory. It's rare that I don't have my Emperor Wraps activated by mid or end of turn 5.
---
Ofc, it's really a fun list. Sadly I still had the feeling, that the deck needed the unfair stuff like CC/Giant or Galaxy to be viable, but it's still completely different from the old Conjurer Mage or Specter Mage. I won most of my games, because I could outvalue my opponent, not because I played CC on a Giant on turn five.
---
It's ofc extremely helpful to play the Galaxy early, but you can still win, if you don't draw into it. I'm considering to cut the Giant, if there are less Warrior on ladder maybe.
---
Some of the minions are maybe to greedy, feel free to change them. If you face a lot of Aggro, more early game or a bigger secret package could be helpful. But against Warrior, you really need a lot of threats :D
---
Against Quest Druid, you should try to copy Reno or Zephrys with Barista, that won me a lot of games already. Plus it's helpful, if you had a board clear in your starting hand, because of Malacrass. Druids are mostly very slow at the beginning, so you should have enough time to find your answers against them. I won most of my games against Quest Druids.
---
Zoo feels almost impossible to beat, they are too fast and it hurts a lot to have no duplicates. Luckily I didn't face many yet. 
---
Quest Shaman and Hunter feel ok, not great, but I have still a positive Winrate against these both classes. Didn't see many Priests or Paladins, but did beat the few I saw on ladder. 
---
Sometimes this deck feels totally disgusting, so many weird stuff happened already and it's a ton of fun. It's not very hard to pilot, but it maybe needs a bit of practice, if you are mostly used to Warrior as your control option. 
---
Have fun:

The only thing I found back when Jepetto came out (other reddit post from months ago)  is if you Jepetto floop, and you play the other 1 cost card first, the Jepetto'd Floop is no longer 1 mana, so I will assume it becomes a full sized floop copy of the discounted card you just played.
---
lol nope, I just didn't know that's how it will summon a minion before death rattle goes off. In hindsigfht the correct play is always obvious.
---
Random card generation fits fine in the competitive card game narrative IMO. It's not a game where you can hold a 100% winrate anyways so who really cares?
---
Of course, the fuck?
---
Why not just use the last wish to destroy the lamp? That way you rule out anyone coincidentally fishing it out of the ocean's currents.
---
Well I’m pretty sure someone said in the comments below that the blue dinosaur that Blizzard used as King Krush is actually another dinosaur 
---
U could be right but most Ravasaurs or Devilsaurs probably have 3 back spikes
---
I think we should give it some time, as almost every class just got access to their own infinite value heron powers via quests, so in the long run I think those will complete with Boom's value very well.
---
against zoo its just a reskinned multishot. kinda strange to see it being hyped up like this
---
That exists elsewhere too, with legendaries appearing in other art. I find that less egregious since Djinn of Zephyrs isn't a named character, but rather a title. Funny enough, the Djinn art wasn't even for Siamat in the TCG but rather a Savage Roar type effect called Monsterous Strength.
---
Oof, it probs thought those others outrank it in value. Problem is it just registers that the opponent has a weapon, not that it’s a big weapon that has to be cleared ASAP, therefor it just gives you value based options instead of what you really need
---
This is just not true. Control Warrior still takes strategy to win with. You can just go around removing whatever whenever. Sometimes you have to leave stuff up.
---
I think most people don't like control warrior because they don't like 20 minute games...they want their games played in 5 or 6 minutes. They don't want to get to turns where you have 10 mana to spend.
---
I prefer control warrior over pretty much every other deck. I find aggro decks to be boring and mindless. They are low IQ decks.
---
You just lost to a bomb warrior did you
---
20 packs shaman legendary (and a free mage quest) pretty bumed out
---
That's just a highroll. Do you think coin galvaniser turn 1 into 2x mecharoo on turn 1 is balanced? Freeze mage can consistently keep your board frozen for 5+ turns.
---
I think it's pretty telling that most of the long time hearthstone streamers are already starting to stream other games more than hearthstone day 2 of a new expansion.
---
I don't believe dusting New expansion legendaries that will stay in standard for 1.5 year is a good idea but that's my opinion
---
Must have for any aggro shaman
---
Thx!

Depends on a specific build, but if its not a budget one then usually you have to:
---
* not be overrun early
---
* clear 2 [[Tip the scales]] board flood turns
---
* survive perfect card from zephyr
---
* clear last [[Chef Nomi]] board of 6/6s (around turn 15, not at endgame)
---
* (sometimes) expect Leeroy

52% winrate against Token Druid - hardly a slaughter.
---
53% for Quest Hunter - but that's not even a good deck. 
---
42% for Secret Hunter, and 44% for Highlander Hunter.
---
44% against Murloc Shaman, 50% even against Murloc Paladin.
---
48% against Overload-Aggro Shaman.
---
And best with a 54% against Zoolock.
---
Basically - Freeze/CC Mage *at best* is slightly above even with aggro decks, **including** token decks.
---
Freeze/CC mage is good against slow, late-game value decks. Heal Druid, Pogo-Rogo, Plot-Twist/Quest Warlock, all of Priest, and Quest Warrior.
---
It's really not that amazing.

Master's Call is the reload tool that makes Midrange Hunter viable.  3 mana draw 3 cards of a specific type is absolutely insane, well worth the drawback of being unable to run non-beast minions.  I would say that's particularly strong and then some.

I think you misunderstood me. I agreed with you with the exception that old adventures weren't really restrictive for f2p people. Or I did you, aren't both sentences about old adventures? :

 "You got much better value out of buying adventures that way. I understand it's more restrictive to f2p players that way though."

I didn't preview this expansion, went in "blind" and was immediately dumbfounded by the quality of cards I was seeing from warrior, already a top-tier control deck. It was like they sat down and said "well control warrior is a rock solid deck right now, but sometimes it still loses before Turn 10, how can we make sure that never happens again?"
