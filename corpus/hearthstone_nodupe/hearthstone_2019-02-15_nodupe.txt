 \&gt; Just because it technically counts as censorship doesn't explain why this censorship -kinglordnok 
---
  
---
Nope. You just contradicted yourself and admitted it's still censorship. Then you play coy and pretend nobody address the question, when people already did with presented fact and dictionary definitions that debunk your mental gymnastics. You just played yourself. 
---
 Why is this bad? Because it makes people delusional. Just like how you can keep repeating the same question like a broken record and expect different results from reality when facts are inconvenient. 
---
&gt; It is in no way proof that most people who do slutmogs are female.
---
Yes, it is. As I keep saying. Because it's a random sample of people who do slutmogs. 
---
Not conclusive proof, but still proof.
---
&gt;You are stupid because you don't seem to understand we are talking about g about all wow users.
---
No, again we are not. You're too stupid to even understand the discussion. We're not talking about all WoW users, but only the ones who do slutmog.
---
&gt;We need to first know
---
&gt;How many people do slutmogs
---
&gt;How many of them are women.
---
Except if we knew those facts, then we wouldn't need to do a poll. We'd already have the answer.
---
&gt;So we need an accurate sample size of the over 100 millions people who have played wow.
---
Ok...I'm blocking you because you're too stupid to even understand what we're talking about.

Cairne is currently featured in the highest winrate even rogue list on HSReplay. That deck struggles with meaningful plays above 6 mana so its pretty good when curved into bonemare
---
Last rotation changed almost nothing due to some very powerful decks not losing anything. After those decks were nerfed a couple months later the meta shifted a lot more.
---
This year should have a much larger shakeup, but I am worried it won't feel different Genn and Baku aren't nerfed. If post rotation Odd Paladin is still the best deck and Odd Mage, Even Warlock, Odd/Even Rogue, Even Paladin, etc. are all really good that is going to suck.
---
&gt; BTW it does say "summon a random totem" so I don't know why you're complaining.
---
Obviously OP knows this. The whole point of the post is to suggest a way to make shaman better by altering the hero power.
---
He's not there for the synergy. He's there to seal the deal against Odd Pally and other flood decks.
---
I feel like we are part of the problem. There are some interesting off-meta decks in compHS threads, but nobody to compile them in single post. And even if somebody will do it, they have short expiration date - even if it's possible to climb with them, people will jump to decks with which is easier to climb.
---
But if you have something interesting, always post it. That's the only way to propagate something.
---
Agreed. If you have the win, take it. If you're gonna get greedy looking to get more quests completed or wanna show off your annoyingly long combo then you're just disrespecting my time so I'm gonna concede and save myself the waste.
---
Seems pretty normal to me. A Wisp with four Wind-Up Burglebots is pretty meta nowadays
---
Hooktusk #1. Blizzard needs to package these heroes and sell them on the store, they'd make a mint!
---
Eyyyy my birth day was yesterday also
---
Did she make them or order them?
---
&gt;  I've played multiple decks to winning records that didn't have an archetype on hsreplay, and tbh it made it feel a little bit futile.  I knew that no-one would ever notice this deck, because it doesn't exist anywhere besides my own client.
---
I find this kinda a strange statement. If you can build your own decks with winning records, then you have the advantage of it not being posted everywhere, and being teched against etc. Then, you get to legend or w/e and make a post about it on competitivehs or something and you can get your acknowledgement too.
---
You have any more wacky Priest decks you want to share? As a person who only plays wacky Priest decks: I ran out of ideas. Currently on [Echo Priest](https://youtu.be/71SRCMvF0Lg).

Wow, no wonder Thekal is the champion.
---
"Very shy...never do this"

---
They do it a lot.
---
And why exactly does shaman hero power need an improvement? This would make Odd Shaman hero power relatively weaker, which makes it even less worth playing. 
---
EU could just get their quest earlier in the day before the event and then reroll that into a lunar quest the next day. Or they don't log in at all on the first day and get two lunar quests in the second day. 
---
We use drawn winrate because it tells us how often our card is working as intended vs how often it's just sitting there potentially losing us the game. 
---
You're right to note that some cards are worth including as tech cards for specific situations, but they always come with a hidden opportunity cost that's hard to gauge without using stats like HSR.
---
(DK Rexxar's low drawn winrates can be largely attributed to two biases against it: it's the most expensive card in the deck, therefore there will be more games it's not playable in, and it's a 1-of, which means it's more likely than 2-of cards to be drawn in longer games (which are usually long because the aggressive hunter deck is losing))
---
Thanks but if I were going to spend money I'd support the superior site being HSReplay. ;)  
---
i guess the point of the deck is to stick the 4/4 for 5 that gains +2/+2 everytime you take damage. I won with it because how easy it can gain stats but thats like the only win con it has

They may outsource China, but that doesn't mean the workers they choose aren't high skilled laborers. The working cost is lower because the cost of living is a bit lower in China. Economic transition happens in every country. America is starting to cut down on its tertiary jobs and increase in quarternary and quinary jobs; however, China is increasing tertiary so it makes sense for Blizzard to hire more people in China (besides Tencent a massive Chinese company owns like 5% of Activision). 
---
This is kind of the vibe that I get, honestly, which is why I wanted to see what people had to say about this.
---
This is the first meta I've really played in, so I can't really speak to it, except that I fucking hate Exodia Priest and Mechathunlock.
---
Iv played against 1 mage, 1 warrior, 1 warlock and about 10 paladins now. 
---
Not necessarily. You could definitely try to avoid these scenarios with just new cards. E.g. cards that allow you to take big risks for big rewards (I don't consider "you need to draw the ONE card that wins you the game" to be the right kind of big risk, I'm talking more something along the lines of quests, "I'm going to do this, you better stop me or you'll regret it -- but if you *do* stop me, I'll take a pretty big loss", except the quests that were printed ended up having way too few means of interacting with them as an opponent, becoming basically Yet Another Soltaire Card)
---
And anyway, viable control decks are already a natural counter to curvestone. You don't need to be able to cheat anything, just to stop your opponent from killing you long enough that your own win condition comes online. But of course, "I'll just stop my opponent from killing me" loses to OTK combos, which themselves lose to aggro/curvestone. In theory, if everything is balanced right, you could definitely have a non-curvestone meta that isn't reliant on any type of mana cheating.
---
You can hit space to reveal cards now too so it wouldnt be as bad as before.

You can't blame a company for seeking cheaper labor. Why should blizzard hire more expensive workers that have the same skill set? The "people who have different views on gaming" might impact the game, but a majority of hearthstone's player base is from China anyways: [https://www.esportsearnings.com/games/328-hearthstone/countries](https://www.esportsearnings.com/games/328-hearthstone/countries)
---
This list doesn't actually give numbers of the player base but I assume this tournament participation somewhat correlates with player base
---
And why are you implying that Chinese Activision workers favor more pay to win systems?

I used to play this combo in a N'Zoth rogue deck back when it was standard. The best feeling was to face a control warrior and get Tank Up before he did.

id like the lightforged priest Grand Lector Enaara from on argus tbh.

Would be female(blizz seems to want both genders aviable for each class first). Would be a race we dont have yet in hearthstone, and honestly i love her voice and how she acts a total oppiste to anduin.   
---
Hurt? Bah! You're still on your feet. Fight more and then we'll talk.  
---
You can rest when we've killed them all! Keep fighting!   
---
Did somebody call for the doctor? Too bad, there are Legion to fight!

She is a priest but rather fighst then heals the wounded.

Talanji would be cool aswell but id prefer Enaara really. and il take anything over anduin.

The DC probably happened a bit before you got the notification. As someone that cannot/doesn't dare to play anything relevant in Hearthstone from home due to the game being unable to handle any stutters I can confirm the way HS handles DC is horrible. I can play any game but HS on my home connection.

&gt;If we stopped allowing the brainwashing pushing people to become trans and gay (I have nothing against trans or gay people but it is not something that should be taught or encouraged in society when birth rates are low)

Do you realize how dumb your entire argument sounds and this is just the cherry on top  
---
I didn't realize you could push people to be gay or trans.  roflmao  
---
Hey kids, you'll be in a minority that is still commonly violently harassed and outspoken against, but having a family is bad for the government so be gay or trans!!!  Many of you will be kicked out of your homes and your families and you will lose good friends because of what their parents tell them, but become gay or trans!  
---
You can't be "pushed" into being gay or trans the same way LGBT people can't be "pushed" into being straight, or trust me, a lot more people would be straight, myself included.  I didn't want my family to insult me and bring hellfire and damnation and Bible quotes down on me when I came out and I didn't want to have to make a private Facebook to have my entire extended family out of my private life which would turn them against me.  Someone, push me to be straight, please!!!
---
What? I was lvl 50 when I started. Not sure what you mean by thinking my level is a "tank" o.O
---
&gt; We were reporting on Secret Paladin being a tier 1 deck at least a week before the balance patch. 
---
Where at?  I didn't know hsreplay did meta reports.  I don't see anything under the articles section of the website, am I missing something?
---
&gt;Because of the way this spell selects a minion to re-summon, Resurrect will be more likely to re-summon a friendly minion if multiple copies of it have died this game.[3][4] For example, if 2 War Golem, 1 Magma Rager and 1 Salty Dog were the friendly minions that had died that game, Resurrect would have a 50% chance of resurrecting a War Golem, and a 25% chance of resurrecting a Magma Rager or a Salty Dog.

When playing mage, I emote greetings to any and all emotes from Sir Annoy-o. It's a match made in heaven.
---
Also greetings as Valeera when your opponent is BMing with the thank you emote.

Even without the immune you could have won
---
Yes. It‚Äôs new for new players.

Big priest its a mid tier 2 deck without polarizing matchups, and they already explained that even if they would nerf the deck because of people complaining about it just for the sake of it, the playrates vs winrates of the deck clearly shows many people play the deck for fun more than because its a good deck in the actual meta. And we all know how things go when they nerf a problematic deck with reasons, nerfing a popular deck without balance reasons would cause an even higher uproar.
---
Also, in august/septeber, many people switched to barnesless big priest, that has a veeery similar winrate. If they do change barnes, you will keep seeing big priests everywhere. You will just give everyone of them free 1600 dust.
---
What we actually need to combat the unfun big priest matchup is to create more graveyard hate cards. Let people interact with the big priest so they dont feel that bad, instead of making a change that wont affect the deck that much.
---
, objectively.  :p

---
DK at the bottom? Lost.
---
She also literally dropped it.
---
There are a few focuses, but the big one is board control. Play a buff on the totem To make it tougher to remove and use it for trading. Generally random priest cards get you efficient removal and minion generation with a smattering of healing. Try to make the most efficient plays every turn to deny your opponent any board presence while building up a large hand of spells.
---
Right ... why bother posting if you're not going to address the topic?
---
Lowest rank was 25 for long. Ranks 50-25 were added for new players. One thing you should learn as soon as possible is that sometimes there's games you can't win no matter how good you play. Don't let those games bring you down and here's for hoping you have a great time with Hearthstone!

this is a joke post btw. because everyone hating wall priest (me too) and gallery priest and 95% of ppl saying both are tier 1 or at least top tier 2 (wall priest has no real counters other than maly rogue and very lucky hunter openings), this site just says 'eh, wall priest bottom tier 2... eh.. gallery priest middle tier 3. what's that? miracle pirate rogue? tier 1, why not'
---
seemed a bit random to me. but make ur own opinnions
---
Yeah but they just legalized sex dolls. So there‚Äôs that.
---
- It is true that Korean users are currently unable to update their mobile Hearthstone
---
- Strangely enough, you can use a VPN to update the game, and this kind of thing has never happened before to my knowledge.
---
- Although the cause is still unclear, many people are saying this is an unintended result of the recent South Korean government's efforts to strengthen their firewall, blocking more "illegal" websites that Koreans have been accessing using "https," including many adult websites like pornhub. 
---
Same here.
---
As long as Activision cuts costs and projects (e.g. Tournament Mode) but pay extra salaries to their CEO and co at the same time - this makes me feel that I support some people getting even richer - not the game.
---
If it would be otherwise, the game would change more than 'new expansion with a cool jpg as bonus'. 
---
There is a chance, but how the hell do we know? We aren't psychic.
---
Jeah they should really move away from their data driven approach to reflect the anecdotal experience of some users. Would be so much better /s
---
And now cold blood gets nerfed 
---
I wouldn't say it's rng, the opponent should have cleared the linecracker and played around it
---
Nope. It just blocks updating the game as far as i know.
---
Compared to the meta-players constantly playing the top tier oppressive decks? The whole "isn't fun to play against" argument is kinda juvenile. 
---
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go struggle with hunters and mock rogues &amp; mages!

good old time they not make this kind of card anymore
---
The truth hurts
---
Problem is, what cards currently do shuffle things into your opponents deck that are a) in standard and b) actually played. The only I can think of is Psychic Scream. There are a few more, like Hakkar or Seaforium Bomber, but I don't think these are actually played outside of meme decks.
---
Slightly less hunter is not better now, because it‚Äôs less of cube hunter, the hunter I preferred to play against than the mindless midrange hunter deck.  The aggro style with Master‚Äôs Call to refill hand is ridiculous.
---
If I have Master Oakheart, I would play wall priest. This helps on hunter match and odd paladin match.
---
So does that mean that SK officially recognizes Hearthstone as gambling?
---
In the start of the Frozen Throne 'adventure', you lose your fight to a Lich King as a Jaina and become Jaina the Frost Lich. Tirion, who arrived to help you but was late, tries to stop you. With your overpowered deck, you tear him to bits, but he doesn't die. Instead, he gets a Divine Shield and gets away. As the game congratulates you with the victory, Jaina the Frost Lich turns back into Jaina saying "We must... resist". After you beat the Lich King, Tirion congratulates you with a victory, but your hero turns into its Death Knight form and announces that "There must always be a Lich King!". You're then told a short story about your hero's future. All of them turn to darkness except for Uther, who decided to judge the wicked even in death. 
---
and again. this post was a joke.
---
it hurts me again that the majority of this subreddit is either 14 or has no understanding for any kind of sarcasm or jokes.
---
if u whould think more than 1 second before feeling omegalul while 'wooshing' me u whould understand what i wanted to say with my post.
---
i don't wanted to say vicious syndicate is bad or u can't trust them at all. 
---
but if u for example go on HSreplay, they have % winrates that say that wall priest is tier 1 because it wins 56% of the time at all ranks. 
---
i was just making fun of that fact.
---
im really sorry again for trying to make a post that's not a jaina boob joke or a screenshot where i got the new cardback noone had before.
---
im will leave this subreddit because too many ppl here are really dumb fuckheads. and because now it makes me more sad than mad, i better leave.

Some context: I used Griftah turn 4 and picked up Coldarra Drake. Turn 5 used coin into Drake, which combined with the mage Shrine gave me unlimited hero powers for 0 mana. As a real slap in the face he could have killed the Shrine and chose not to. Feelsgoodman.

No, it had record revenue. Record profits were never mentioned and it as actually mentioned that most of their IPs are on a downward trend.

&gt;Bobby‚Äôs 15m bonus
---
80% of that is in company shares which are in fact not money you can use. Is it a bit bs? Sure, but this is also downplaying the importance of a good CEO.
---
&gt;But I guess we can‚Äôt all expect every CEO to have the same basic human decency as Satoru Iwata.
---
Actually no, we can't. The reality is that Blizz is a bussiness first. It would be nice to have every CEO be as self-sacrificing as that but the relity is that that's not their obligation. 
---
There's also the fact that even if the CEO took a paycut these people would still lose their jobs. These layoffs are mainly due to restructuring and cutting down on unnecesarry departments such as the Destiny PR team and the HotS e-sports division with a refocusing on devs. 
---
maybe *cast* only counts when its not countered?

Well it is the most sensual of the salted, cured meats.
---
1. Play and kill an Immortal Prelate and a Silver Vanguard (without recruiting Undatakah)
---
2. Get your Valanyr buff on Undatakah
---
3. Play Undatakah. It'll gain the deathrattles of the Prelate and Vanguard, which will make it shuffle itself into your deck, then recruit itself back out, while equipping another Valanyr. Each time you equip one a minion in your hand gets the buff.
---
Bonus points: Play Spiritsinger Umbra and kill your Undatakah, it will kill itself and recruit itself back out over and over around 20ish times, buffing your minions to 30+ attack. I haven't been able to do this in a ranked match yet.
---
I don‚Äôt have any of those cards
---
Not for retail.
---
Retail. Retail never ends.
---
no, just dick.
---
If it appears the game is stuck on his turn past 1-1/2 min then you need to restart because you have lost connection. Then you will get back in time to maybe miss 1 rope of your turn but you‚Äôll be in it. Nothing sketchy just you lost connection. It‚Äôs happened to me before. 
---
But they didn't fire many of the old people.
---
I sense a forced meme coming
---
^(Just in case you're not joking: It's not actually cards, it's a few lines the Innkeeper says when you start the game up)
---
Oh dear god.... a new player this high in ladder? ;-)
---
nah i mean it's 4 pm in Europe
---
Hahaha c: 
---
Loa
---
I didn't even know you could re roll. Whoops. 
---
They didn't fire many of the old people. Thay was all my point was.  
---
"Do not fear power, fear those who wield it!" on turn 9.
---
Well I guess I just lose now.
---
When this card was revealed on stream, not even 3 seconds later someone in chat said "FOOT". Unfortunately, that's all I think of when I see this card now.
---
Honestly I think Res Priest or OTK Priest. Is a lot more boring. Whenever I was playing secret hunter against them they wouldn't play a card until turn 6, and then they OTK you on like turn 8.
---
You're right: Resurrect pulls 80% Rag and 20% Barnes.
---
But to clarify a bit on your headline: Resurrect does not consider minion types or something else. It purely looks at the pool of died minions ("graveyard") and pulls one from there. No matter what type.
---
And since dead minions are not "stacked" in the graveyard but rather exist as own entities, the probability of Resurrect pulling one can be calculated like you did.
---
This is amazing, I‚Äôm going to do this to my brother haha
---
Yeah I was wondering about that interaction
---
Wish i could comeback to my innocence HS day. Enjoy it while you can lolz
---
Even Warlock at the minute... have the dust to build Big Priest but something about that deck just doesn't appeal to me.
---
I did the same thing when i started playing
---
Inner Fire Priest - The deck of kings
---
The memes are keeping out the real content. As soon as this one is removed, we'll see all the good content that it was hiding. /s
---
I, as a developer, am forced to prove that I'm worth my salary constantly.
---
How does anyone prove they're worth $15 million? What work does he do that another person couldn't do for 10, or 5, or 1 million? Does he have some insane set of skills and charismatic magnificence that somehow makes him a rare Adonis-like leader? Or is he just a regular workin' guy with good connections?
---
Most people don't have a full set of any expansion.
---
That was Karazhan.
---
Lol. Yea that about sums up this situation
---
Not on this computer (or I would have in the last post).  But off the top of my head:
---
Must haves:
---
 - Quest
---
 - Lynessa
---
 - 2x Immortal Prelate
---
 - Primalfin Champion (I would probably run two if I had enough)
---
 - Zola the Gorgon
---
  - Death Knight (important card - provides necessary healing + the hero power threat)
---
 - 2x spikeridged steed
---
 - 2x Sounds the bells
---
 - 2x desparate stand (cool combo with the murloc, forces enemy to silence or otherwise deal with it)
---
Other minions that are nice, but seem less important:
---
 - Zilliax
---
 - Sunkeeper Tarim (this guy seems like an auto-include in most decks, but he hasn't shined in this.  Still, sometimes he gets you out of hairy spots)
---
 - Crystalsmith Kangor (the double healing guy, really useful with DK weapon)
---
 - 2x Righteous Protector
---
 - Tirion (forces more removal, although be careful with your 5/3 weapons so you maximize them)
---
Be careful with anything that draws cards such as Blessing of Wisdom or Potion of Heroism.  I've included one of each because I need some card draw early on, but remember that Lynessa will get those spells too and I have a lot of games go to fatigue.  When I was running 2x PoH I would overdraw.
---
I've been running with Consecration and Blessing of Might.  The former just isn't that useful because it doesn't help against the hunter spellstone, but given that it's the only AoE I have I leave it in.  I'll maybe cut the latter.
---
Yeah when this place was still bitching about the boomsday meta I knew that they would never be happy. The expectation from them is that blizzard releases a new expansion every four months that somehow invalidates all the previous decks, creating new decks for each class and archetype, all of which are perfectly balanced at 50% winrate for each matchup and extremely varied in playstyle while somehow also not increasing the power level of the game overall is actually insane.
---
Thanks you. Very helpful guide and tips. Current it‚Äôs hunter warlock and pally. Hunter being my arch nemesis.

This is amazing.  You, friend, are a poet.

He said that he actually had more subs with MTG, I doubt he'll return to HS.
---
Why though? 
---
For strategy...I usually try to bait out the silences on Galvadon or Lynessa or the murloc and go for an endgame with the IPs buffed up.  
---
You definitely want to save spikeridged steed for the IPs if possible.
---
There are so many good targets for Zola you can decide based on what type of game it is.  For one that you can tell is going to fatigue save it for an IP instead of Lynessa or Galvadon.
---
Fuck you, he's great even if you die on turn 4.
---
My thanks to you.
---
People screaming about SJW's not realizing this is our age old friend, Puritan values, rearing its ugly head in actual laws and procedures from banks, to monetary tranfers to advertising to website content to GAME content.
---
Warlock is usually decent for arena due to the heropower giving you refill all the time.
---
This sort of stuff scares me a lot. China (much more closed internet than skorea) also had a period of censorship, where it blocked the release of new games. Korea is a democracy though, and it really puts into perspective the consequence of having older people yell on tv about the dangers of video games every day. It's all talk until it isn't.
---
same here. Unfortunately we'll now have to wait months for the next one
---
Well you‚Äôd have just won a few turns later anyways..
---
We‚Äôre gonna be rich!
---
Oondasta will always be useful and the Overkill upside is great. Jan‚ÄôAlai is great if you have a fire eater or two, but you don‚Äôt want to have to HP 8 times otherwise. Toki is too RNG dependent IMO.
---
And now we have to wait another half year for the next one.
---
you don't? 
---
if this is your board, then they will have nothing to target with spellstone, and wrath (provided you already killed their auctioneer and any other minions they run)
---
thus leaving their hand full so they never win with mechathun
---
I'm basically running that setup without the quest, with hakaar and Liam 
---
Why is this here? It has nothing to do with hearthstone.
---
I reward my opponents when they don‚Äôt leave despite lethal on the board by getting them as close to 1 as possible and then playing Yogg. 
---
i've been playing since day 1 of release.  i have all expansions and buy ~80 packs per expansion.  still missing a few epics and lots of legendaries.
---
r/lostreditors
---
But what about pain, death, or shield? Hey, even mind control isnt bad.
---
Blizzard is indeed very old-fashioned when it comes to Hearthstone - they barely change anything (cards even) but it's always a tad bit sour when you go back to this slow, painfully boring reward system.
---
I think you are missing toothy chest.
---
I'VE GOT THE BEAST IN MA SIGHTS 
---
Lol I‚Äôm sure many of us thought that when we started but you‚Äôll find that it‚Äôs really not that simple, warlock has one of the best hero powers for sure. 
---
God not that too
---
I agree 110%. I dont see why people complain about odd paladin so much. Even if you lose the matchup at least the game wasnt a 25 minute slog to fatigue. In an odd warrior meta you end up in a full-on odd warrior vs otk combo meta, which is not fun at all. Odd paladin is annoying but people just play it to climb and then they play something else. Its like midrange hunter. Its a strong deck but it is rarely unbeatable and rarely a free win. Honestly what do people want to see as the top deck? Zoo? Tempo mage? Freeze shaman?
---
Still casted from the deck 
---
Maybe they are blocking HS because Jaina was nerfed and Korea wants it to be changed back
---
They also don't like the 1 shot meta?
---
Weesa gonna be rich!

Some weeks ago, while streaming Magic he said he's rather work at McDonald's than ever stream Hearthstone again.

While true there is MORE variability in the competing priest decks compared to druid, all of the cards that define them (stall, heal, taunts, removal cards) are ran in every. single. version.  They all play with very similar styles with control priest being the slight exception that it actually does have some board presence.  However, they all have the same fundamental strategy - play few cards early (whereas druid used to armor and draw), use strong removal cards, then come in with an OTK style win at the end.  The type of OTK doesn't really matter when you just sit back and watch them stall/heal then OTK you.  True, counters exist, but especially for players who enjoy interactive games revolving around board presence and minion interaction (which is most of us), the MU can feel heavily decided before it even begins, and many games feel very draw dependent (do they psychic on curve? dooes their mass hysteria go off correctly?).
---
The reason all the decks are good are largely based on mass hysteria and pyschic scream and vivid, and they all tend to hard mulligan and/or use vivid to play all those cards on curve.  That is not that different from druid having the same handful of very strong cards that cater to any win condition.
---
There mere fact wall priest exists is a testament that priest does well because of core cards, because even though it's arguably a unique deck (or a unique take on the prior build which ran the guy that damaged himself, or even the old school OTK priests), to play against it feels the same.
---
The play style is very, very similar, no matter who you face.  You pretty much know what's gonna happen facing them, and win/lose depends largely on them having all the answers or not.  THAT is what makes them feel like druid.
---
All that said I do get your point and respect your opinion.  And I don't dislike priest players - blizz only gives them this one play style if they wanna ladder.  I just hate facing them because it's a total bore.
---
Oh hell yeah 60 dust is automatically worth more than all my packs are, let alone 60 gold.
---
I'm sorry but the druid is HORRIBLE. Gurubashi chicken? REALLY?
---
Yeah I just picked this game back up after playing in beta and about a year post release and I'm shocked how much of the coregame is literally identical.
---
I guess you meant [[Oaken Summons]] at Mechathun Druid

4/-/- | Gain 6 Armor. Recruit a minion that costs (4) or less.

Can't survive priest OTK'ing you turn two though

We should probably pin this if this is what actually happened.

You should have seen the Saudi interwebz.  It was a real pain in the ass working as a contractor just to get to some US websites.  Its amazing what the government ruled as "not religious appropriate". 
---
Huh?
---
lol
---
&gt; And then there‚Äôs control priest which plays more like OG freeze mage than any of the other priest decks
---
This seems like a *real* stretch. More than any of the other Priest archetypes, Control Priest wants to be on the board and getting in chip damage. It plays more on curve for the board than either of the others and infinitely more than Freeze Mage ever did.
---
Kingsbane Rogue getting nuked was the best thing to happen to humanity since the cure for Polio. 
---
Sometimes I play while cooking and forget my turn has come up until I hear the rope. 
---
Why on Earth would you ever concede?
---
Well, statistically those were amongst the best decks in their respective format.
---
From a subjective point of view those are the most desirable decks to craft if you put your focus on winning.
---
From an objective point of view those decks were also the most likely to receive a nerf in some way. 
---
In my opinion said changes were a good thing. Yet I believe there's room for team5 to adress better compensation, because like you said, the decks basically got gutted
---
&gt; A CEO has no obligation to they‚Äôre employees? A business has no obligation to its employees?
---
Way to strawman. That's not what he said. He literally said that it's not the obligation of every CEO to be as self sacrificing as Satoru Iwata. That's a far cry from saying that a CEO and business has no obligation to their employees.
---
Further, businesses, and by extension, their CEOs owe plenty of obligations to their employees. However, employment in perpetuity is not one of them.

You're wrong.

Like, sure, you might have *forgotten* to take a photo. But to say that "yeah I was thinking about taking a photo, but I was just laughing too hard to actually do it" is nonsense.
---
Yeah, I'm sure this situation is humorous -- but there's no way it was so funny that you were laughing so hard you were physically incapable of taking a photo at that moment.
---
Quit lying OP.
---
Never the right call mate.

---
King Krush is replaceable for charged Devilsaur. Otherwise you pretty much need everything. If you really want to replace Katherina, you should just go for a solid 8 drop, like violet Worm
---
I was confused about why you called her Natalie Kibler then I remembered that's actually his name not a username lmao
---
Hakkar counters mecha'thun completely. Darkness doesn't counter at all. Candles draw on cast, so they don't prevent the deck from emptying any longer than other cards.
---
I started playing while Naxxramas, too. Did comeback while Ungoro. Did buy all Adventures afterwards and for me the Singleplayer content was worth it.

OK means Okay.   /smh
---
However, Odd Mech Paladin will be quite different than current Odd Paladin
---
Tonight! A tale of wonders and magic!
---
Very clever
---
This.
---
There's no reason for it to work differently. If you have more unique minions in your dead pool than the spellstone will resurrect, than as with Resurrect copies can increase the odds of a particular minion coming back. 
---
Granted, it MAY work differently, I can't say because I haven't tested, but there's no particular reason to think it would.
---
Try not to disenchant any kinds for at least a year. For the first few months you wont have a good idea of what you need

---
On top of that, even if you have the entire classic set it's still expected to yield more than that because of the potential for Hall of Faming (potential for opening golden duplicates of to-be HoF cards) and the most likely set to experience nerfs (any number of duplicates is a above the average dust contribution).
---
Helle there.
---
I have been playing Hearthstone for a while. Jet I just started playing Warlock. I never win when I am playing Warlock. Is there anywhere to improve on my deck. Maybe give some tips for creating decks.
---
Thanks in advance.
---
wtf fuck?
---
Odd shaman is only a meme deck because there really are not moments where you think "damnit if I had just got totem x I would've won!"  The spell damage totem is great but you only have so many lightning bolts or spells and otherwise giving up even cards just doesn't make sense.  Plus every viable shaman deck has been nerfed to the dumpster (though even is still ? tier 3) so there's that.
---
i wouldnt mind if all they did was give a golden legendary of the players choice out 
---
I don't follow... The most likely outcome of re-rolling a quest is a 50g quest, so it's still optimal to keep anything that is above average value, in this case 100g (if we don't consider things like the ease of fulfilling such a quest of course and only focus on maximum profit).
---
I hate it right now. Too strong auto include in every Odd Pally deck, sometimes they add TWO!
---
If you have a sufficient classic collection then the cards in the packs are probably useless to you and since cards convert into dust at a rate of 1:4 you will need  4 times as many  classic cards to make a new one as opposed to rerolling into a gold quest and then outright get a new pack.
---
i was due for legendary in boomsday. Got lunas pocket galaxy. niche card i guess
---
tell that to millhouse or lore walker cho
---
There's no doubt in my mind that the devs think to themselves 'can this be abused if the player has 2 more copies of it in their hand or if they reliably have it fished from their deck' every time they designed a new spell for priest over the last 1.5 years because of Shadow Visions.
---
When Shadow Visions rotates we should be get some spells that we couldn't have gotten otherwise.
---
I would say no because people will just send you a bunch of messages during a match they're losing or even try to interrupt you by spamming friend invite
---
Yeah Millhouse is useless but Lorewalker Cho is useful sometimes
---
‚ÄûWill a Variation of this this Deck still see Play?‚Äú you cant predict that because you dont know how the new cards will influence the meta
---
I got the mage shrine and combined it with shadowform so I just had a better version of his hero power
---
Never said it was 100% luck. Don't put words in my mouth.
---
The picking of cards *is* luck based. You get buckets and some are good, some are not. In the long run, it evens out. You choose cards to fit what you already picked, you expect to pick, or cards that are good and skill is very much involved in that selection. So even that selection isn't 100% luck based. But there *is* rng. You can't state otherwise.
---
The last time i played i was lucky enough to be offered a legendary, unlike most of my runs.  I was offered lorewalker cho, harbinger celestia and some less bad legendary. I still lost to the guy who had the lich king and and some other great legendary because, on average, his cards could deal with almost two of mine. And I had not been offered a single board clear. So I had no chance to recover.
---
But the fact is I don't enjoy it so I won't play enough for the luck to even out. I don't average more than 5 and I never got more than 10 wins. I won't play enough to become a great arena player. I leave that to those who enjoy it. I prefer choosing exactly what I put I my deck.
---
Look, I'm not arguing the clip's not awesome. It is. And I completely understand why you'd want that finish.
---
But to act like we don't understand or blame the opponent for conceding---speaking directly from the heart, I get it.
---
There's _always_ some "fringe exception" that denies you that win once in a while. It's awesome at first, but when you've played a number of games, for a number of years, it starts to get tiresome. It's just the same "random factor" with a new flavor.
---
There's some deeper rooted problems in the design. Hearthstone's the kind of game that aspires to create special moments, but it only rewards winning. When you're playing with a friend---especially old fashioned table card games---those moments are rewarded by social interaction. You talk about the game, maybe even for hours, comment on each of the plays and share the fun together. By complimenting your opponent, you get something else in return---his friendship.
---
But when you're playing Hearthstone? It's like your single player, your opponents just look all the same and you're just trying to beat the dice. Any form of interaction is muted out of fear of harassment, which in turn sacrifices the ability to share in special moments and say something as simple as, "Hey, check out this special combo!"
---
(Sorry I'm kind of a wall-of-texter and tend to get very elaborative.)
---
Never seen this posted before 
---
Is Kingsbane Aggro Rogue not good in Standard? It is absolutely rampant in Wild. Or is Rogue's low winrate just down to faltering Odd Rogues post-nerf?
---
Actually one month ago guy posted that Here, but after it was removed he posted it on circlejerk
---
It‚Äôs meant to disappear after you complete it. You‚Äôll get it again next Wednesday, and the one after that. It‚Äôs a 1-per week thing.
---
What deck are you playing? 
---
Any chance you have leftover dust to craft a deck? 
---
We can't say very much without knowing what you play and what you lose to. 
---
It depends on the order. Playing rebuke and then Millhouse makes all the spells free, but Millhouse into rebuke makes them all cost 5... or at least that's the interaction that Millhouse and Loatheb have with each other.
---
I personally think we need a single 'Mega' quest to work to. Like a 1000gp win 50 ranked games. Something that is righ reward high time investment but you FEEL like you are making progress.  Then when it completes you get another line a 800 dust win 5 games with 5 classes
