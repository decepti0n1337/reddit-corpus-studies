druid decklist pls?
---
---
---
My opponent once got grom into king krush
---
Honestly, the charge mechanic itself is what makes it so powerful. And likely will be phased out slowly. Leeroy imo will be HoF at some point, especially with it being used in decks time and again
---
you say like shaman is going to fall that far. Shaman still has many power plays but is a little slow its not to bad but will struggle controlling in the early which is good
---
It would probably usher in a lot of super consistent aggro decks essentially doubling most burn.
---
r/suddenlygay ?
---
Hsreplay

It's okay for a midrange deck to be better than the others that's true. It's not okay for it to dominate them completely as well as control and still have a pretty good chance against aggro. Which is the current case. These nerfs have increased the number of decks on ladder from 2 to 3 now. It's still deathrattle rogue, face Hunter, and shaman galakrond. Nothing has really changed. You're just bound to run into a face Hunter and rogue a little more often
---
Pretty standard these days, no Zephrys/Dragonqueen or Nomi. Ysera Unleashed is an awesome card imo! I’ll send the list
---
I agree
---
At least its a Highlander deck
---
And they need apothecary and the blade in their opener... I'm not seeing you're point here. It's a highroll on both ends
---
All three were great, adding actual power level (although too much sometimes ahem assimilate or die) was good, specially for a fan of wild like myself.
---

---
DoD &gt; SoU &gt; RoS. Not by a large margin, though. Also worth mentioning that blizzard seems to be getting (marginally) less greedy and a bit more giving with each expansion, although the adventures are nasty cash grabs designed to suck players dry that I won't even mention.

---
Aggro Mech Paladin is a lot of fun for me at the moment, 19-11 post-patch (r3-4) vs rogue, hunter, and shaman mostly.
---
They'll need to raise the rarity of a lot a cards to make it balanced
---
Is this an night elf tree or something else? I have never seen this guy before in warcraft universe.
---
If you cant see how silencing or stealing all your deathrattles kills the deck then i dont know what to tell you.
---
By playing galakrond shaman?
---
Why shouldn’t budget decks stand a chance? It’s annoying but good for the game
---
Tbh, Quest Druid doesn't have a great winrate on ladder. It is good only in certain matchups where the healing and taunts will save you, and even against Face Hunter it can sometimes be too slow. It is good against Control Warrior because they have trouble outlasting you or having enough clear for all your 5/5 and 6/6 minions.
---
The first few rounds are only like 30 sec for everyone cuz there isn’t shit to do.

---
And it looks like nerfs worked perfectly. Crying baby
---
alright man, whatever floats your boat.
---
It wasn't so much that the wild cards rotated in, it's more that Extra Arms got nerfed back to 3 mana. 
---
Also in this meta? No way. Everything in this meta has Rush or Charge. If you're not Shaman, you're not allowed to have any minions on the board at the start of your turn.
---
Sludge Slurper is still a direct upgrade over Cable Rat.
---
I just spent 3600 dust crafting Edwin, Leeroy and Toggwagle, fuck
---
Some people are Timmys, some people are Johnnys, and other people are Spikes.
---
The higher up the ranks you go, the more Spikes you're going to see.
---
For the record, I’m super curious about the “Bomb/Albatross” deck. That sounds awesome.
---
Thanks a bunches
---
Lol. It's kinda weird that multiple salty people both tell people to kill themselves AND that they hope they get run over. Either that or the person who said that to me 1+ month ago changed their name, and it's a standard insult for them.
---
A few more suggestions to get you to first:
---
- I like to ditch Rat Pack late for a Savannah Highmane or even Deathcoiler as there usually isn’t enough board space for the rats to make a difference (if you sell hyena, which you should)
---
- Definitely replace the triple Pack Leader for a Baron Rivendare. The buff from golden Goldrinn is insane, and it’s nutty if you have a golden Rivendare
---
- What tribe did your opponent have? In my experience, Zapp is only useful against beasts to get Mama Bear or demons to get Soul Juggler. It’s much better (if you can) to have another deathrattle beast like Infected Wolf (not sure if the name is correct but it’s the minion that splits into two spiders.
---
While this board is kinda hard to setup, I’ve completely dominated games with a combo like Goldrinn + Mama + Rivendare.
---
You might as well disenchant every priest card you own at this point
---
I'd throw in some mass hysteria for some more control and khartut for healing in addition to spirit of the dead just for some long term survivability
---
What
---
Thanks
---
Nah, he had 3 10/10s in board i was praying for a togwaggle
---
He is the messiah!
---
Even your opponents. Steal their alexstrazas
---
I just wish Priest was meta. :((
---
I already switched back to Magni.
---
I really liked the idea but the voice just feels off to me.
---
Also when I press an emote I kinda expect it to do something like that, when I press greetings on him or the thunder king it sounds like I'm bming
---
Yes,  four times. When I had two normal ones, DR only trigged twice.
---
That would be chill as hell, obviously.
---
Worth noting, if you only play standard godfrey rotates in 4 months, valdris stays around for a year and 4 months, so take that into consideration.
---
Looks like a soul bonding in the thumbnail.
---
Malygos is just a pretty good wincon if you hit him with frizz or just with soulfire.
---
With the early pressure/damage from giants and abyssal Summoner he often just closes out the game.
---
What rank are you playing at ?
---
So only as George?
---
*pack leader
---
You mean the Trading Card Game that is based on the MMO which is based on Hearthstone?
---
for anyone wondering. i used galakrond warrior for most of my matches alternating with a galakrond warrior with taunt support. been on a win streak for a fat minute and pushed me from rank 8 to rank 5
---
Let me tell you about my boy /u/ProfessorNox/ who was making quest cards in January 2016
---
https://youtu.be/b6iWdnOavuA
---
I agree except for Rat Pack. It fills the board with solid stats if Mama Bear sticks
---
There would have to be a lot of rules to avoid abuse cases. You might be better off just buffing weak classes
---
AROOOO
---
[removed]
---
Really impressive. This meta has some crazy agro to deal with. I’m struggling with my list right now. I’ll reply back tomorrow to see what you think of a few of them.
---
You meant the TCG that is based on the MMO that is based on the RTS that hearthstone is based on.
---
Uh what?  Hearthstone is based on the mmo, not the other way around.
---
It would be too punishing to players who don't have large collections.
---
With most of 5-L counter queuing based on match-ups, if you're not doing the same thing then for the most part you'll never queue into the deck your most favored against. It's also going to create a meta where you have to keep rotating decks, which isn't how most people enjoy playing the game
---
I play wild and I'm not really sure.
---
I had that happen when I was playing warrior. It was turn 6.
---
Void Lords used to be it, but they got buffed to 5. Not sure what I'd use from the existing card pool though all the premium demons are in, you'd have to invent something. Could probably get away with something like the dog but gives +3/+3 to the board instead of only +2/+2, or maybe something built to protect your Soul Juggler?
---
Got my 12 wins around 50 years ago
---
Even if that were the case, HSreplay tier lists seem to be based on data, not some intangibles that combine into a "deck power" like VS tier lists.
---
Same here lol. I'm so happy I didn't dust my duplicates after opening 100 packs! I just left them there sitting in my collection at "9+". Got thousands of extra dust like you.
---
Give a demon divine shield but be nuts on its own
---
Very conservatively priced (polite way to say it's terrible! Especially compared to the actual sidequests with OP rewards for their mana cost)
---
SMORC ME G-
---
..oh
---
Did you win? considering you were facing Nefarion
---
Yes. Very. (I got like 8 health ups.)
---
Nah. That background elf is too sexualized for Hearthstone.
---
&gt;I think that the high-roll nature of this deck doesn’t lend itself well to being consistent/reliable for competitive.  
---
This generally doesn't matter. People would still run big priest or aetherworks marvel in MTG in tournaments. One deck was based around random discard in MTG and saw results in tournaments.
---
Could you please maybe try finding a way to implement a side board on ladder?
---
Tier 3 now.  (not joking)
---
Shaggin waggin?
---
Zeph has never given me spellbreaker against rogue.  He just doesn't.  I don't know why.
---
At least it was fair to give each class a death knight, irrespective of their strength level. Now it's just a few classes who have hero cards and some of them tend to dominate because of the hero cards.
---
and Dragonlord's deathrattle can pull the itself and other ones out of hand , so OP *really* isn't wrong
---
Whoa I would love a DK addition and change to hero power. It would probably take some tweaking. I would also like to get a poison back (again with loss of amaglam).
---
i am just kidding but this was my suggestion as a nerf in another post where someone said demons are too strong now. voidlord used to be tier 6. now it's tier 5 and demons have no reason to go to tier 6, unlike other comps.
---
I think they must of had a server hickup, as it resolved itself by the time I got home.  Hopefully, it cleared up on your end too.
---
It saw some play in some hunter lists lately as both a dragon and a beast
---
And its olso usefull sometimes as a mech for ziliax
---
How about a banning system of a class or certain cards??
---
Punctuation is everything...
---
Every*
---
*terms and conditions apply. Prohibited if you are a Warrior or Shaman
---
damn.
---
The Shaman DK never saw play in a T1 deck.
---
The major weakness of those decks was Tempo Rogue that would just demolish them with tempo into T7 bonemare.
---
Or it could be a twist and give a minion reborn. If you could give a juggler reborn that could be good.
---
These comments as well as the many they've made on individual posts on r/customhearthstone say otherwise

Rafaam is one of the most infuriating heroes to play against, because uniquely other people's mistakes hurt you too.
---
Why would you have to pay 3 gold to play curator amalgam from hand that’s really confusing
---
Not OP but blizzard is at its best when they take an existing concept and make it accessible to a wider audience. They didn’t invent arpg, rts or mmorpg but they did take those ideas and make them into exceptional games.
---
Like what? I'm looking at the dragons right now and none of the other big dragons help you close out games.
---
Juggler is good in the early to mid game, but a liability as the game goes on. 3 or even 6 damage is not that useful when the enemy minions have 50+ health. You'd need a lot of imps dying to get any value
---
Hes not, yogg is, and no that sounds awful tbh
---
I miss Frost Lich Jaina sooooo much.  Elemental Mage was the most fun i ever had with a mage deck.  Highlander mage is close second.
---
I agree with you, but you could just have two versions of the same deck built, one for secret mage or w/e and one more general build. You'd only have to click the other deck, no swapping screens.
---
Ok a nightborne mage would actually be awesome.  Blizz, this comment right here.
---
iirc evolve shaman was tier one late in the expansion after balance changes.
---
I was wondering why I hadn't been getting any...
---
Regardless of the overall power level of the deck apothecary is way too strong.
---
They can try it in casual or create a new mode, don't mess with ranked because it will make dominant decks even more dominant.
---
Battlegrounds is a mode within a CCG (Hearthstone) that's based on an MMO (WoW) that's based on an RTS (Warcraft 1, 2, 3). 
---
Battlegrounds' genre was created when someone made a MOBA (DotA), which was a mod on the said RTS (Warcraft 3) at first and it spanned a sequel (DotA 2), which inspired an auto-battler (Auto Chess), which plays practically the same way as Battlegrounds.
---
Full circle or full burgle?
---
Nope, I just want more and more tech cards to keep any one deck from getting too powerful.
---
I was regularly on custom Hearthstone for a while 1-2 years ago, and sometimes Mike Donais made comments by himself. He even said, he often looks some cards there.
---
But first it’ll be on their radar
---
"a long while ago" meaning within the last month and a half since we've known about Battlegrounds? Also let's not forget that Battlegrounds IS in the beta phase still.
---
That doesn't really change the fact that the people who *are* playing it are still seeing their winrate hit hard.
---
Has hunter ever not been in the top 3?
---
Grats! What list did you use?
---
Wouldnt we all just feel the need to constantly micro manage our decks after every game knowing we wont face X again and can drop a few cards knowing we dont need to worry about Pirate Warrior next round. I dont like it at all.
---
Not according to hsreplay. You have to go down to number 19 to find a decklist that runs him.
---

---
Insequent#11115. NA 80g quest trade. I'll show, you go first.
---
Yup the whole animation aspect needs to be deeply reworked because it simply breaks the game for a lot of people and play styles. Animations during combat need to be "instant" when applying buffs and many of the animations during purchasing need to also be drastically speed up. The fact that disconnecting and reconnecting is a viable thing to get first pick at minions is stupid and flat out shouldn't be allowed.
---
I’d love that. Honestly I think this is a good idea.
---
Well, it's well established that designers who create Magic: the Gathering cards aren't allowed to do that (and in fact specifically request that people not send them unsolicited designs) so that someone can't claim that WotC stole their idea if they print a card that's similar. Whether or not they actually adhere to that and don't look at /r/custommagic or other forums is obviously up to them.
---
Has dragon vibes.
---
still hoping for a legion expansions 1day with hero card for each class. either all join legion. or its triclass like Msog,but 3 join the legion,3join illidans dh's and 3 join the army of light basicly. Plus we could get a actual good illidan card then aswell
---
Sometimes I wonder if nerfs are really effective or if its just the perception that something isn't good anymore that drives down its play/winrate.
---
rogue was used in mill rogue,kingsbane mill,quest rogue sometimes,jade rogue,miracle and malygos combo.
---
Rogue has the potential to be top 3. People just need to stop playing that janky deathrattle deck.
---
*Distant noises of priests cheering* They're no longer the bottom class.
---
On the positive side, if anything this pushes DR down further. As aggro decks aren't healthy for them.
---
Do people just refuse to play wild? I rather enjoy wild and don't miss the above cards as I get to play with them whenever I want. :)
---
I tried that as well, but no such luck.
---
Elysiana to get rid of your bloods. Or maybe that 2 drop that transforms all neutrals to class cards, it should work on the bloods.
---
It is just you. Hunter was never tier 1 just strong tier 2 in the previous expansions. Current face hunter beats shaman mage and warlock and thats it. Very easy to counter.
---
Golden Bran and golden battlemaster is the most disgusting thing to ever exist. Then a maexna spawns randomly from sneeds and snipes it in the middle of a full board and you vow to never play the game again.

---
Got around 68% win rate with apxvoids highlander mage list. Perhaps cyclone decks are dragging the numbers down.
---
&gt; WW has cards so oppressive they were HoF’d
---
Yeah they aren't in standard anymore
---
Was anyone playing priest though? If so what deck did you see?
---
back when he made the same arena videos every time?
---
Seems bad as you can build the top deck with one bad matchup and crash with it.
---
But you cant go lower than R5 tho....
---
You can lose a million games you just lose legend ranks never fall back to rank 1. Start of new season you start at rank 4 though
---
I dabble in hand rogue
---
Cancer deck typically just means aggressive deck because you only have 4-5 turns to draw the tools you need to win
---
The matches are super polarized, like the rogue deck you either draw necrium or you lose, face Hunter, your opponent draws their heals or you win
---
Decks with one single game plan are seen as cancer
---
the app crashes very often! i hope they'll fix it but at the moment i have the feeling that nobody knows about it. Sad for mobile only players.... and the chat is broken for months now, at least on ipad.
---
"Yeah, *I didn't like that one either...*"
---
Abandoning Hunter? Why? Hunter often has the cheapest decks and is the most free to play friendly class by far.
---
Seriously? Just fucking relog you braniac.
---
Not at all. I crafted Jaina, Guldan and Anduin all golden and use them everyday in Wild Reno Decks.

---
Must sting losing to an illiterate person.
---

---
Thank you
---
Do it in casual. This would make ledder infinitely worse.
---
My Heal Druid is farming these Face Hunters really hard
---
That is correct I meant to say how warrior in general had a low win rate even tho patron warrior was a thing.
---
Thrall pops up a lot. It's even currently used in the Wild Evolve Shaman lists!
---
Yeah, highlander shaman, what a degenerate deck /s
---
Not the same thing: Ghoul hits your own minions, which makes it a decent tech card, and deletes your own divine shields.
---
Instead of healing punch them in the face.
---
Velen Mindblast combo, or Auchenai Flash Heal instead of Mindblast for more flexibility.
---
Boredom
---
We're all confused by this. Think the OP is drunk.
---
NA Dragula#1268 Looking for someone to trade 80g quest.
---
Also galakrond priest is bad and other priest decks are from old expansions.
---
Ah I remember my favourite card
---
Yeah wild is pretty fun right now, a lot of different decks and classes.
---
Regarding the decks, meta is still really young, I can think of dozens of decks fitting T1/T2. Maybe odd rogue ? If you have Baku and vilespines the deck should be pretty cheap and it's really good right now, and you can tech it to beat pretty much anything in the meta. Secret mage also, some lists don't play any legendary and it's only commons/rares besides that. Same with mech paly, it's dirt cheap if you already have Leeroy and Zilliax (mech hunter too). Galakron shaman should do pretty well too, even with the nerfs.

Yea galakrond priest is hot trash and a lot of people play it so it tanks the winrate of teh class.

---
Pirate warrior huh? You could say you are “smooth sailing”
---
I took them, sorry. I have double copies of every goddam one after one patch.
---
It's basically only usable in deathrattle mech which ideally want golden kaboombot and golden egg with baron.
---
This is why you accept, copy paste "Get cancer!" and immediately remove him, like he would've trashtalked and remove you.
---
Been playing it a bit and you actually go face regularly. 80% of Galakrond Invokes/hero powers go face, unless if you really need to trade. There are a couple of big minions in there, especially after playing a fully Invoked Galakrond and it's hard for the opponent to clear your board turn after turn, especially if you can get a good Barista off.
---
considering Kripp is a mulligan wizard, he probably starts with them in his opening hand.
---
I’m on iOS and had to disenchant on the PC client. Irritating as all get out.
---
Do we think this will spike the popularity of either A. Mechs and/or B George... because it seems divine shields are crucial
---
That was the list that inspired me to play this! I havnt tried commanding shout but it was on my mind with battle rage or something maybe. I didnt think of the interaction with deathwing but now im gonna try it for fun haha
---
This was peak Hearthstone imo
---
I posted my list down below, you can run it with 1x apothecary I just think its pretty broken on turn 4. Even if they silence it, they still commited mana, probably had a shitty turn and you still came +1 off it because you have the deathrattle in hand. So many swingy turns with highlander cards and 0 costs cards.
---
I lived playing horseman pally.
---
The treant that was attacking cant attack the other hero or itself during misdirection.... yo
---
I feel you, i noticed the same thing. Last night i cut the two dragon breeders for barista and siamat making the only dragon synergy voone. Barista can be used with town crier if youre desperate to draw scions aswell
---
Treant Druid OP....Rank 10....Not able to make a screenshot  
---
10/10 shitpost
---
yea but this also goes both ways.  if a deck is "mathematically" 1% better than another deck, then every 'good' player will switch to the superior deck.  leaving only bad players and timmys playing the bad deck, since they also make more mistakes during the game the winrate would be much worse than 49%.
---
a deck being posted having 55% winrate needs adjustment, but the adjustment is often smaller than many people would think.  
---
but i think the other side of things that sometimes team 5 care about, and sometimes apparently not, is what cards feel good to play against and which feel bad.  id argue that mutating in to a 10 drop or the hero cards that summon 7 minions more often than not feel terrible to play against, id rather have seen changes to galacrond itself even if it was less of a 'clean' fix.
---
I mean, do you just need an enabler to shop, like how people only eat ice cream if someone else is there to share the guilt :p? If you want the hero, and cash isn’t a concern, just get it (but only via online shop, and not using mobile/iOS, cuz I guess you get charged more).

New shaman card: Battlecry: Give your rush minions +4 Attack.
---
That's a chicken
---
I have an ipad
---
Aha what the fuck this is dreadful.
---
people really think this is a good idea?
---
I had an idea a while back, so i’ll propose it here.
---
9 mana 1/9 Battlecry: for each choose one card you have played give this minion +2 attack.
---
I love how Paladin has a top tier deck but literally no one enjoys playing it so it sits at the hard bottom haha
---
Uther OTK was a thing right up until Shirvallah-Holy Wrath became a better Paladin OTK, iirc.
---
kibler played a dragon elemental shaman that ran it!
---
Oh there's his face.
---
I feel murlocs got a lot weaker but a lot of people are still traumatized.  Getting enough stats along with poison along with ds is a serious investment again.  Amalgam really helped but without that thicc  annoy o module taunt to help carry and the lookout feeding us triples for megasaur.. it's very lackluster.
---
It'll probably also rebound when the hard counters fall out of Net Deck favor... Don't underestimate the power of net decks, once one rises to the top everyone copy paste that shit into HS so fast your head spins
---
Give me some examples of "large deathrattle mechs" you'd want back without the buffs. The best one I could think of is the egg which spawns a 16/16. However, Kangors space could've been filled with such a mech, to begin with. 
---
Unless you have a golden sneeds shredder because let's face it the base version just ain't that good either. Most of the time having another 30/30+ body with divine shield/death rattle is much better.
---
You are posting stats worth like 2 days, with the meta not even being stable, with Shaman (and other decks) not even having a chance to actually adapt to new decklists. Those stats *are not reliable.* Acting like they are and trying to prove something with them just shows that you are the same as the people you are trying to meme.
---
No because I still use the two that I liked in wild all the time
---
If you can't figure it out for yourself that's a problem.
---
But I'll try and help.  By your method of explaining dragon bane is a 10 mana card that deals 21 damage and summons a 3/5.
---
It takes multiple turns to shoot.  The leper gnomes need to actually die to deal damage.  If you can't see why that makes "7 mana deal 12 and summon 3 1/1s" a moronic way to describe it I can't help you.
---
Rip i Main mage and priest
---
Look at it the way that the battle is over, but the war isn't. Even if he beat you, there are more matches to come, might aswell get an advantage later by making you do worse. Even if you dont play, that could be a win in his book, less deathrattle rogue players to deal with(or any popular annoying deck in general)
---
I don't get it
---
One mana deal 6+ is prettttyyyy good it turns out
---
Did you win tho?
---
Ahh my Arcbound Ravager PTSD
---
What’s your deck?
---
Looks like a messed up shader.
---
Unity games amiright?
---
Well, if his neck is any indication,  this card will be broken so power level is on check with the rest of this set.
---
Why bother running Reno and Jaina in the same deck?
---
3 Mana
---
3/2
---
Battlecry: Counter your opponent's next deathrattle
---
I mean, in Wild, pure aggro Pirate Warrior is just strictly better than a mid-range one. The only "answer" you really need is a Spellbreaker or Shieldbreaker.
---
Same problem. Super annoying
---
Galakrond priest obv /s
---
Yeah I get what you mean. I have data for each hour, and the tool interpolates this data to build super smooth animations and not have bug jumps
---
Out of topic but will Hsreplay update their data for the latest balance patch?
---
By de old gods!
---
I feel like that was more so thanks to unstable and corridor creeper though it usually felt pretty slow to drop your DK
---
Is this a serious question? Jaina is a staple in any Reno mage deck.
---
That’s a myth. They made that change intending to buff it
---
I hear ya man. I’m not saying Eddie isn’t a valuable card or anything, and Flik is certainly really good, I’m just stating my experience playing highlander rogue. Eddie tended to be just another big minion rather than *the* big minion, and it was pretty rare to get those solid van cleef turns early, especially with how aggressive the meta is, since you’d often have to save a combo activator for apothecary or lackey gen; ya can’t count on him as a win con, just a nice supplementary card. Flik isn’t a win-con for the same reason Slayer wasn’t a win-con, it’s just good removal. Removal isn’t a win condition on its own, it has to be supplemented with cool cards, like ol Toggie Woggie. I didn’t really think of the rotation in a year but if that is a concern then I’d agree.
---
Yup! Have a look at [flourish](http://flourish.studio). I am using their free plan for now, and it works really well
---
Thanks, I will!  These usually take me roughly 20 hours, but I'm a bit slow since this is not my day job.
---
Too balanced, you’ve got to think bigger!
---
I would much rather be able to use 2 ofs and rely on the passive heal but you do you man. Reno is an incredibly boring card imo
---
Paladin and Priest in a race to the bottom.
---
He has a galakrond deck without galakrond
---
Yeah, it's pretty strong.
---
4 Mana 3/2 body -1hp Draw a card. Vs.
---
5 Mana 1/2 body Draw a card.
---
The only use I saw for that card was so you could make a Pure Paladin deck but with neutral cards.. and then switch later when you need to trigger a battlecry, but that seems really situational and I don't know if that deck is even very good.
---
Shaman *is* still good. People switched.
---
brilliant
---
Unless they change it in a patch, yes, it works. Arcane Mysteries takes the action to draw the secret, this triggers the card draw trigger so the Transmogrifier converts it first, then Ancient Mysteries does the second thing and changes the cost of the new card to zero.
---
adding you in game Haplo
---
I agree entirely. At 7 mana mogu sat in my hand sometimes bc the enemy didn’t flood the board so he’s a lot slower at 9. I just thought it was funny &amp; crazy high roll to get the 10/10 taunt AND discovering the rez spell lol.
---
Who are unable to sort out data
---
I’ve been playing face hunter and am happy to lose to all of the control warriors it feels great to punch these shamans right in the face so much I don’t even mind the bad match ups
---
FYI guys, Combo Priest is Tier 1 at Legend rank atm :D
---
Relaunching the client also sometimes does the trick.
---
Indeed. The best thing is trying to find that Zapp so that you kill the mama bear / baron, and then demolishing them
---
Hunter is only ever good at countering the FOTM Top dog.
---
Thing is, Hunter has always been super easy to counter itself, so my guess is that if Face Hunter sticks around too long we’re gonna see how easily classes can put together a control deck that shits on Hunter.
---
Nah it’s instinctive
---
I'd love to play some type of mage deck but I haven't gotten any of the epic cards that are required for the past 3 expansions
---
Treat druid
---
The main reason I am playing it right now is pretty petty: i’m beating the hell out of all of the people still trying to play shaman lol. Doesn’t hurt that people are still trying greedy stuff which gets steamrolled by face hunter and I am winning most of the mirrors because people don’t realize that there’s more to the deck than just clicking on faces they’re just netdecking it
---
Hey man. I’ve been playing since Beta and somehow finally hit 5 for the first time. I’m really hoping to grind for the last 1/3 of the month for legend. Way to go!
---
This deck is so borken 😡😡😡 s/
---
I think the devs just make balance changes without thinking sometimes. The A.F nerf was only just a little while ago, and they already forgot that moving the Beast to Tier 3 means she could get two of them on Turn 3. How do they not think ahead?
---
No, it is a combo deck
---
Treant😂
---
A finite amount of material(even in those materials, there are an infinite number of cosmetic, chemical, and atomic, structures that can be applied), an infinite way they can be used. A pencil can draw while infinitely reaching a 45 degree angle to the paper, and never reach 45. Alternatively, it can infinitely only draw at a 45 degree and still have variations in how the pencil is held each time. There are absolutely infinite ways to do anything, just not all at once. Which is why the scenario of monkeys is framed under an infinite timeline, because the chance of something not happening under such conditions is infinitely negligible.
---
Ive had the same experience, i think its just the standard basic quest reward now but i could be wrong.
---
I only get 60s too, ever since they made changes to the quests.
---
He literally played the **exact same** Uldum deck. 0 cards changed lmao
---
You literally lost to it
---
Same here. Crashes after trying to play the first card of the game. Can't always get back in  either, losing ranks, and game is now almost unplayable. Super disappointed.
---
It's been two fucking days, it's way too early to tell if these changes are going to stick around.
---
Sorry I meant you’re playing a more control deck and playing against aggro and then against control the second game. Was kinda vague there
---
Ive tried the transmogrifier in my highlander mage deck that already had an ancient mysteries. With one of each the combo happens like 1 in 10 games maybe, obviously it’d be a lot more consistent in a non highlander type deck since you can run 2 of each. 
---
When you do the combo, it is pretty strong. Especially if you coin out the transmogrifier on turn 1 and then play ancient mysteries on turn 2. Theres obviously a chance for duds but there are a lot of high rolls that set you up to win the game then and there. It is a little awkward when your transmogrifier is left up and your good cards you draw get turned into bad legendaries. But on the flip side, it gives you access to powerful class legendaries you wouldnt otherwise ever get so it can still work out in your favor sometimes. There are some legendaries that are very niche and you can’t really make good use of them. In matchups against slower decks, turning your low mana stuff into legendaries can be really really good, kinda like how control warrior would run elise back in the day. 
---
So my opinion is basically that the combo isnt reliable enough to build a deck around, however, both of those cards individually are good enough for a spot in some mage decks. Ancient mysteries is a great card without the combo and the transmogrifier is a solid 2 mana 2/3 against aggressive decks or a card that can give you excellent value against more control oriented decks.  Together they offer an extra die roll that can win you the game.
---
I didn’t say the deck was bad lol
---
candy drop holiday one.  if you already have card back, I was told, then you  get a pack
---
I posted the decklist as a new reply to this post. It’s kind of a home brew deck but really fun I just lost to most pirate warriors instantly all other decks it’s positive winrate.
---
Golden Khaarj here. Dusted so freaking fast you wouldn't believe.
---
Popularity leads to intimacy.
---
Wish Dragon's Pack had been nerfed. 5 mana for 10/12 worth of taunt with a minor pre-condition isn't just OP, it's just silly honestly. I know that the Corrupt Elementalist nerf indirectly addresses this by making the Dragon's Pack on 5 less reliable; but in some ways that's worse. It's still possible to get the Dragon's Pack powered up on 5, but now it'll be a bit more high-roll, and swingy, making it more frustrating to play against.
---
But I mean as soon as its dead its as if nothing happened. Obviously if silenced the minion is gone, but is that it?
---
Literally every time my choices are shit like Crowd Favorite or Phalanx Commander.  Decentish bodies that do absolutely nothing for me for like 2-3 rounds.
---
I get something with potential like Soul Juggler or Pack Leader then it's only after that I discover 3 other players are also going demons/beasts and now we are all fighting for scraps.
---
Lmao
---
You’ve been playing since launch but didn’t get it last year?
---
Togwaggle Albatross Priest
---
I don't remember, but we did get more free packs than normal
---
Not the best time to play Hearthstone
---
"I've got the best deals anywhere"    
---
Yeah. It'd probably be pretty decent. Maybe make the elise bees otk a bit more reliable
---
Yeah, the card is just bad. It counters Albatross, and that's kind of it. What's the purpose of this card?
---
What? turn 2 coin egg into turn 3 stalker dude is not something control decks do
---
this is why knowing your matchup specific mulligans is very important.
---
leeeeeee- BOOOM
---
Are you talking about face hunter? Is holy wrath paladin considered a counter against it? Because from my experience today it absolutely sucks against it. Board clears will face damage yourselfe and healing once for 8-16 with kangors doesnt do shit. And by the time you can tempo a shirvallah with banker or even sathrovar you are long long dead already.
---
It does not...

---
Deck winrate isn't a fair representation of the power of a card. Prophet Velen has been an incredibly strong, deck defining card before and the played win rate of 54.5% shows this. Just because the deck is bad doesn't make the card bad.
---
Priest is the weakest class at the moment and has some of the lowest win rates and therefore their cards will appear disproportionately more than other classes. 
---
To make it more accurate played win rate needs to be the metric (which still doesn't work properly as some cards such as win conditions have an absurdly high played win rate as they are only played when you win and others have an absurdly low played win rate as they are the last resort option). Ideally drawn win rate would be used as this is the most accurate metric generally agreed by the professionals.
---
TLDR: Basically, this list indicates the worst decks. **This list doesn't show worst cards**, especially because the list is only taking into account big data samples (clearly dead ringer is not a worse card than warsong commander or core hound for example). Drawn win rate would be better.
---
I mean you can run whichever cards you deem better of the thief package, I dont run anka cuz I dont have it, not sure I would run it if I had it anyway.

Challenge me!
---
Thank you!!!! My deck is actually pretty close to this. but I like yours better for sure. Except for one thing- no gloop sprayer? At worst it’s a slightly more expensive Manipulator, and at best you’re adding two more lucentbarks to the board. I’m curious about your thoughts on this
---
Edit: also, I was running healing touch. Does this deck provide enough support for Lucentbarks condition? I’m guessing that Hidden Oasis takes its place quite nicely since it’s just as effective late game when you actually have lucent out there, thoughts? 
---
Double edit: just realized that with Spellkin, there’s a decent chance of getting another Crystal Power and perhaps that’s where you find the extra support for Lucent that you need
---
meanwhile your cobalt guardian gets sniped at the first possible opportunity.
---
Paladin, Priest and Druid playing leapfrog
---
Nah fam I'm not hating. I was actually laughing out loud when I noticed he didn't even change the decklist at all. 
---
It's just that this game was kinda funny to me, I didn't think people would be playing old decks without changing anything
---
Still can't find it
---
Still refining the deck so I'm not sure what is best.  Feel free to try it out and let me know if you find any good changes.  Dragonrider is hit or miss, but if it lands on any of the 3 untargetables it's quite good.

Hmm. Wish that had been communicated more, I would have dusted a few echo cards.

If Deck1 just played against something he can beat usually you swap to Deck2 so you can play vs that class again.  There is still a small gain no matter how you setup your resets.

Why would you trust them in the first place, about anything.  Random internet people are not a trustworthy source of information, just in general.  If you aren't viewing every human that crosses your path with cynical skepticism, you are doing it wrong, doubly so when money is involved.
---
Let me know if that works. I’m away from my computer as well.
---
Let me clarify if possible: I don’t necessarily think because of this that nobody would have any reason to run this deck. 
---
I am going off of 2 things: 1) Statistics from my tournament. Not just my own games, but the overall percentages of decks used and win rates. 2) My own personal preference. I find these types of decks unwieldy and just prefer something I am more comfortable will play out the same way each time.
---
I love Treants too. Mind sharing your list so I can compare
---
Private gatherings aren't eligible for Nemsy. Only registered Inns or whichever they're called that are publically accessible can get you Nemsy.
---
This is like making fun of someone who is driving a 2019 when the 2020 model is out
---
Oh okay but how are they considered weak? And how would you rank them?
---
It would've been better if you put Zetalot there somehow.
---
Kudos. I liked it, made me laugh
---
God I love beating hunter babies.
---
Yup, only established taverns can be eligible for Nemsy.
---
Silverback Patriarch isn't getting power creeped because Silverback Patriach is way below the power curve of the game.
---
Waaay back, Extra Credits did a video on power creep and hearthstone. They explained that taking a card like Magma Rager and printing a card like Ice Rager is not power creep because both cards fall below the power curve of the game. It's only when a card is printed that is far above the power curve that every other card has to compare to that card.
---
Piloted Shredder is the example they used because at the time Piloted Shredder was not only the go-to 4 cost card but also outclassed lots of 5 cost cards. It was so good that unless another card had special interaction in your deck, you were just better off using piloted Shredder.
---
Fornite fornite
---
That's because they changed it to update with new sets after people complained. It wasn't intended like that from the start
---
Not enogh success to make it viable. Mostly win by casting reborn and the new dublicate if dead spell. But I might as well then use Mechathun. However, puttibg in blood spells is nice when it works.
---
I got Nemsy almost two years ago using Nox Player + GPS Spoofing. There are guides out there. So far, I haven't been banned.
---
Oh, it would have sucked if it didn’t get updated, I actually like the card because of the constant new cards added to the pool, increasing the possibilities
---
War Golem has 14 stats compared to Biodiversity's 10.
---
Also if your opponent doesn't have a means to clear five 2/2's then odds are they were screwed long before that point.
---
Druid had a reliable way with Azalina too, not sure what happened to that deck though, don't any of those in wild now.
---
The raw definition of powercreep is when one card is objectivity better than another, regardless of how powerful each card is by itself. That’s the definition I—and most of the community—use.
---
Because Priest has zero win conditions. Their galakrond is trash, Mind Blast is gone so Velen doesn't really do anything, there's nothing for them to cheat out and then resurrect, and Inner Fire is never going to work in a meta where every single minion in Hunter and Shaman has Rush. Actually attacking with any minion in this meta the turn *after* you played it is a pipe dream at best. The only exception being maybe Necrium Apothecary since delaying its death is actually beneficial. 
---
What are Priests supposed to do, load up a deck with just board clears and healing, only to still get regularly blown out by bad draw RNG? There's just no point. It's a total rock-paper-scissors meta right now but the scissors are exceptionally dull.
---
Absolutely. There's definitely some changes that could be made to make it better, but the general idea is working in more spell discovery compared to normal handlock to generate as many nether breaths and soulfires as you can for a big burst finish.
