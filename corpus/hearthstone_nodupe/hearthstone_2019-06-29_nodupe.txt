Oh yeah, this can definitely win some games, but it's a bit niche.  SW Horror combo is a bit more versatile.  It can clear wide boards or Yseras.

I always knew Leeroy is murloc

So it's not exactly a bad tech card, but rather a bad meta to use this card as a tech.

This is amazing! What makes this better or worst then Shaman murloc?

Well yeah, but MtG never quite took off in the digital arena until after HS. I played MtG with my friends back in highschool. It was great. My cards are either back at my parents or with one of my siblings. And one of HS' strengths is the fact that it's more casual friendly.

Otk mage it would have so much stall and control options that it would just be cancer. 2 blocks 2 time outs alone would make it basically unkillable.
---
It's not negligible, there are many times a card is better for you than your opponent, that's literally the nature of random cards and i guess deckbuilding. If they get Hagatha as Aggro, they get an ok card but if you get it as Control, you get a great card. Sure RNG has an impact but that's why you plan for BOTH cases when you play this card. That's what separates a good and a bad player when playing Griftah.
---
Majority of those are terribly costed to clear the board or are just bad cards in general bad comparison tbh

This! Especially the second statement! I think too many people are looking on it through nostalgia goggles from Warcraft, but it truly was one of the worst expansions in HS. Bottom tier for sure.
---
Step one: Draw Skulking Geist (very important step, do not skip). 
---
Step two: Play Skulking Geist. 
---
I tried the deck out and can confirm that the game is over after you play skulking geist! It’s really OP, you can finish the game on turn 6 or even turn 5 with coin.
---
No if you are using that argument to why priest having so many board clears is not a problem then you are wrong. The point I was making is that most of those board clears in priest are viable and you are saying that I’m wrong cause Mtg prints viable board clears every set and it works fine. Take Core set 20, the white board clear is planar cleansing, yet this will see very little play across all formats. Most new board clears are not viable.

People need to stop parroting this dumb, extremely low effort comment under every post that is even slightly memey. I don't understand what you get out of posting it in every thread.
---
The comment doesn't even make sense really, circlejerk subs aren't just for dumb memes, they're usually more there to make fun of trends that happen in their parent subs. There's no reason why there wouldn't be memes on the main sub
---
I 100% expected them to reference this in the flavor text, cause that's the first thing that came to my head when they announced the name of the card. THat's probably just cause I've watched the office too much though

Wisdom ball is up there in the top maybe 6, but I certainly don't pick it all the time.  I'll pick it over weaker cards, but it is a little bit swingy, and also you can't build a deck around it.  I have lost games because of it.  Obviously i've also won games because of it.  But my gut feel with these kinds of cards (in any game mode), is if you think you are an above average player, you avoid these cards as they may cost you games you could have won on your own, but can lose you games you would have won.  Conversely they are stronger for less experienced players.

for the last 3 months autochess had less viewers than hearthstone as does dota underlords at this current moment. TFT isn't an example of the rise of autochess games as a genre it's an example of one game getting a lot of attention because it's a league of legends spinoff.

zilliax is only a problem when mechs are super meta lifesteal on a big mech is game wining some times so maybe remove magnetic from him that way he is still good but not game wining.

That's good UI design. Make sure non-important information (like emotes) don't get in the way of a player actually playing the game and digesting important information (like card stats).
---
Was ist das "WILD"???
---
They had corrupted blood in their deck, surviving one more turn would've won me the game. I used my last 3 mana on fan of knives from Azalina, which drew this sad Shirvallah.
---
Grave Robber 4 mana 4/4
---
Battlecry: Discover a random opponent minion that died this game. Remove it from play
---
The problem is that big priest is essentially a combo deck that beats both other combo decks and control decks
---
Well let's be fair here. CC only net creates one 8/8, and it requires the other one on the board to do that. Typically a standalone "8/8 with drawback" card costs 5 mana ([[Fel Reaver]] [[Bittertide Hydra]]) with giants being the exception, when their conditions are met. This of course puts the 3 mana 8/8 generated by CC already ahead of the curve, even before twinspell. So I definitely agree that card seems a bit much.
---
Some point to mountain giant as the problem child in the deck, I disagree. The ability to plop down an 8/8 turn 4 or so, at the expense of developing no tempo before that really isn't a huge issue. The issue, imo, comes from Mage's ability to get a large hand while also generating tempo, courtesy of mostly [[Mana Cyclone]]. CC is of course the icing on this cake, the way to turn that hand size and early tempo into an actual win condition.

I think this is even more true for Warlock. And warrior is the reverse.

You need way more to come up with recency bias than it being last and being high. By your logic it can't be high in a valid way.

No problem just win 500 arena  and nothing else!
---
&gt;But Odd Warrior loses to a lot of combo decks since it has no pressure. Priest has a fuckton of boardclears and pressure and value. Odd Warrior misses the constant board pressure in the early game and thens tends to lose to Exodia Mage et al.
---
And Big priest loses to Aggro decks. The meta would look just look like the Big Priest meta you described:
---
1. Odd Warrior
---
2. Combo decks that can deal with near infinite armour to beat Odd Warrior
---
3. Aggro decks that can consistently beat 2
---
This is just what happens in a meta.

Exactly, this is a game. It has the ourpose to give you pleasure. You are free to rope, BM or whatever as long as it suits your "sick" needs. If the time comes you are getting angry or sad because of a match you shod leave it or find a way to otherwise turn the situation to your advantage.

I know everyone hates Barnes, but I play rez priest without him. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but the only thing he's good for is diluting the rez pool. Especially with archmage as a 4 drop to replace Barnes.

1. This deck isn't refined in the slightest, but this is the decklist I used to climb. 
---
2. I was able to climb from rank5 to rank2. This deck seems to do worse against Mech decks and token druids. This deck is really good against conjuring mage and warriors.
---
3. It's a VERY fun decklist, I really enjoy playing this style of midrange decks.
---
A graveyard is the list of cards that have been expended by a player.  In traditional card games, this includes minions but not tokens, since they have no physical card representing them.  In HS, it would certainly include tokens.
---
Thanks man!
---
Isn't it strange that this exact same topic comes up in various forms regularly yet some are down voted and others are up voted?  
---
This wasn't exactly a high effort post compared to many others so are people really just voting on this sub because they have seen what others have done?  
---
I just don't get it.  
---
To the topic at hand and the answer I've often given.   
---
It should either not be a twinspell or have it's mana significantly increased.  
---
Context - unleash the beast gives you 1 * 5/5 for 6 mana.  
---
In what situation that someone would actually use CC would CC give you worse stats than that over 2 minions even if not being used on a large cost minion?  
---
1 Mana minion, ok probably worse off. 2 Mana - 50/50 how that will go, 3 mana+ - profit.  
---
It's a really badly designed card as it is yet people will still blame the giants for some silly reason.
---
naxx was good id say outside undertaker.
---
You forget the 8/8 no longer need be an 8/8 but it can be a 8/1 and have served face damage or minion removal before being "sacrificed".  
---
So the drawback as you say is only really valid per your examples if you are using it the same turn as played and you'll generally only do that if you're getting the early play where it's effectively mana cheating the card out i.e. mountain giant.

I was trying to think of dominant decks in HS history, and how they could be improved...
---
My first thought was pirate warrior with Hooktusk, but realistically I don't think we can count of the games having a turn 8 in this mode.
---
The patches nerf also hurts the deck.
---
Could Tunnel Trogg/Totem Golem shaman be improved? I feel lots of decks could be improved for their turns 6 to 8, but (same as hooktusks) I think we're looking for turn &lt;5 improvements, because I don't expect games to last much longer than that.
---
And as far as turn 1-5 go, I think these decks had pretty much everything.
---
I guess I'm gonna go with: The old aggro shaman, with Zap and Thunderhead. I'm considering innervate, but since the nerf it's not that good... 
---
Could that deck be merged with pirate warrior, I wonder. Maybe it breaks the synergies too much.
---
It speaks volume about the power of these decks if I can't think of much things to make them stronger using other class cards. 
---
Ah, maybe zoolock with bloodlust? Then again, Zoolock's power is in large part the hero power, and I think you're not gonna be heropowering a whole lot in this mode. 
---
Whatever the best deck is, it's certainly gonna be some ridiculously aggressive deck with insane burst to kill you on turn 4-6 at most. I think people (in other comments) thinking about control decks are way off. This mode would be all about the quick kill.
---
I got downvoted to hell suggesting the exact same thing a few days ago.
---
I'd bump Ungoro up to the A-list. Maybe even S. People forget that Ungoro was an expansion where new deck types were being discovered all the way out to the last month before the next set dropped. I consider that a serious win.
---
Then it's Sea Giant or Rabble Bouncer people complain about.  
---
CC is the problem because it MASSIVELY limits future design choice.  
---
Giants have had their issues in the past but have survived long enough in the classic set that they aren't considered too OP.  Yet here we have a card that will eventually rotate and you suggest messing with classic cards?  
---
No, let's deal with the problem card which is CC.  I like the concept but the mana cost and twinspell is ridiculous as it stands and a few poorly made cards in the next expansion puts mage from a contender to overpowered.  
---
What happens when a class gets overpowered?  It gets nuked to oblivion and I'd prefer that not happen and they just dealt with the problem card.
---
As an arena player(started playing right after Gadgetzan's release, so this for the ratings I disagree with since that):
---
I have no idea why Boomsday is S-tier. Probably B or C. 
---
I have a love-hate relationship with Un'Goro, so maybe I'd put it closer to C. 
---
KNC is D or E. Just absolutely broken.
---
KFT probably C, Death Knights were cool as a concept, but that set introduced as much brokeness as any set from the Year of the Raven and the arena meta was absolutely awful.
---
Gadgetzan A or B. I remember this set very fondly, but the power level was all over the place and constructed was really bad back then.
---
Since those cards couldn't really compete with the ones from the previous year it felt like all the expansion did was add giggling inventor and Zilliax.
---
Auchenai (one or the other) + circle
---
And of course the opponent is playing big priest
---
Never, never trust a goblin! :]

---
I mean yes but that's not that big of a requirement
---
Except there is no such thing as a dead minion zone.
---
If they buffed grave horror to 11 mana it slightly helps priests and removes it completely from mages.
---
The coin
---
Maybe change cost for all the different hero powers.
---
Also giving rush to only one mech each turn could help even if not a lot (interaction with zilly, if you attack first with him u suck at the game)
---
That's understandable. I really enjoy control warrior but it sucks you have to rely on really broken cards to actually play that archetype.
---

While I don't 100% disageee with you, you're implying that while the warlock drew for three turns and if you curved out, now you potentially have to invest your entire board plus more from hand while the even lock follows up with 10 cards in hand and higher mana to play better cards than cheap minions and spells.
---
It's like a zoolock could develop 3-4 minions in that time an even lock got a mountain giant, but then you could trade your board into the giant or risk the following hellfire to remove your board and leave the giant.
---
I don't think giant is the problem here, but noone should downplay how insane the card is on turn 3.
---
silence priest is tier 1... JK, it's not worth playing in standard
---
You have to challenge *them* for the quest to kick in.
---
Kix's was pretty good too

Mark my words the new Call of Duty will kill HS for good
---
Still not as good as a deck of Taggawags.
---
Kinky
---
Newsflash: mountain is the problem
---
Been playing OTK/TTK snipsnap warlock with Glinda. Pretty fun
---
Original speed.
---
It’s not really comparable. Conjurer’s is a massive swing card that can win the game on the spot. Rexxar is a value engine that wins the long game.
---
Not necessarily. Cards aren't Hall of Famed because they're unbalanced, they're sent to wild because keeping them in standard forever would limit design space and keep the same old combos or archetypes around forever, which makes the game stale.
---
Damn that is crazy man. You should share more details haha.
---
Either they introduce a graveyard or they have to redesign resurrect priest. It's really not cool how it's designed right now.
---
The first feast?
---
force close and open the game
---
Like I said, Mage is polarizing the meta.  At high levels of play, you're pretty much either playing Mage or playing decks that can beat Mage, like Control Warrior and Mech Hunter
---
Are you in north america region?

Token Druid is actually really good.  I'm  playing right around 1000 legend with it right now. It just can't beat Mage.
---
Hey there
---
If you reread your first post, you didn't ask a question and you strongly implied Hafu was a no-name before HS. 
---
&gt; Kripparrian was a big name long before HS, Trump too. Blizzard's a business, they'll help people that help them in turn. A big name who makes top 100 (or even 1000) is much better than a nobody who finishes 1st. It's that person's job to get popular, then Blizzard will work with them, as it's mutually beneficial.
---
I watched a chunk here and there, but since Pavel is done, I am done watching.
---
Wanna 69*
---
Same here, but I crush every deck with my Even Dragon Reno Warrior.
---
Holy shit thats savage.
---
I mean, it's a decision between:
---
- 8 packs and a bit of dust, you learn the new Hearthstone, interactions, meta etc. by yourself in a normal environment
---
- or nothing, you learn the game again in a newbie friendly environment on levels 50-26 (you can skip them if you want) and you get free packs every 5 levels
---
Wrong sub
---
Dr boom is a bigger problem, cc mage puts him in his place and i kinda like that.
---
Sent you a request, posted below
---
_Wanna 90°_ ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
_No, thanks_
---
I wouldn’t say snip snap is god tier. Very good though.
---
You really should tell us more lol
---
counter card exists = deck is unplayable, flawless logic you got there
---
It’s like the balancing team are incompetent. At least make it a 2 mana 1/4, give it a slither of a chance of being played
---
1 mana 1/2 would have been perfect I agree, but now it is utterly dead. Might as well have been hall of famed.
---
Haha make a post about that shit
---
They photoshopped a hearthstone screen onto someone playing pubg
---
It should be a design limitation for team 5. If a card is busted with mountain giant it shouldnt be printed. That means you're printing an inevitable problem card which cheats a bunch of mana, calling, cube.
---
CC could probably be 4 mana to be closer in power level to Molten Reflection and other copy cards.
---
Wow, very interesting. Thank you for your videos, I really enjoy them! :)
---
It’s pretty op man. It’s also certainly not fun to play against. Constant board restoration with big minions is out of bounds.
---
:thinking:
---
Don't ever let anyone tell you you are not just as capable as anyone else. Believe in yourself, and don't be ashamed of licking windows. 😉
---
Challenge a friend trade 80g NA Haplo#11591
---
No. A two card combo that doesn't outright win the game in a class' archetype with little access to draw isn't really worth doing anything about.
---
The board clear too is probably the weakest in the game currently, costing more mana and cards relative to everything else currently being used.
---
I also wouldn't say it goes against Hunter's Class Identity either. Missile Launcher is pretty much useless outside of the combo and a neutral card at that. It helps compensates for he class' weakness.
---
It's not dumb. It's greedy and selfish. But hey, corporations being greedy and selfish? Shocking, I know.
---
I wont lie, thats definitely me when I can taste the Mana
---
You are right. Snip snap is useless mostly. Thanks for your words :)
---
Didn't even really need Talanji there.
---
It's not the best deck because everyone is playing decks that are strong against it.  The reason I think it needs changed is because it is a really strong spell, and so I don't think you should effectively have four copies of it in the deck.  
---
Make it not a Twinspell, same mana, same effect, but it can only be used twice.  It is significantly stronger than any other Twinspell in the game.  Twinspells are supposed to have downsides for getting an extra copy.  This one doesn't really have a downside.
---
This is why I don't rag on casters. Jokes are fine, but you can't do what they do.
---
It's because Scorch changes its cost to (1). If it said "reduce the cost of this card by (3)", then Apprentice would reduce the cost to 0.
---
CC is fine, mana cheating isn't.
---
Because casual is a joke and blizzard wants you to treat it like a joke.
---
Explorers much higher, standart much lower. But overall it is right.
---
I can taste the dust
---
It is unbeatable among other control decks, making every other control decks unplayable. That’s the problem. I would want to see data on how each matchup of Big Priest goes but I don’t have the access. But based on hsreplay’s data, almost every high-win-rate deck is an aggro deck. And one immediate explanation comes to mind—BP.
---
Also a lot of people play wild to play flashy combo, powerful cards, meme deck. Big priest kills all of that and that’s one source of complaint. I for one can’t imagine someone mainly play wild because they miss playing Odd Paly, Murloc Shaman or whatever.
---
But, if it changes the cost to one, then any cost reducing affects should affect the cost as if it was 1 right?
---
I didn’t say unfun, I said pointless and kinda boring, as well as not being able to do anything unique. Do you know the amount of crazy shenanigans a death rattle rogue deck can do in wild, for example? And how each game can be played entirely differently depending on the combination of cards? This isn’t the case for big priest. They play every single game the exact same way without any wiggle room for creativity. I don’t even think it needs a nerf, I just think it’s a mind numbingly dull and simple deck to play.
---
This time for sure.
---
No because it polarizes the meta.  You either play Mage, or you play decks strong against Mage.  That's really it.  
---
Say, for example, you wanted to play a deck that is strong against Control Warrior.  That makes sense because Control Warrior is the best deck right now.  Well, Token Druid is really strong against Control Warrior, so maybe you play that.
---
The problem there is that Token Druid loses hard to Mage.  So even though it is really strong against the best and most prevalent deck, you will still have a hard time climbing because you will lose almost every time you see a Mage.  
---
CC is a part of why I think Mage stomps every deck that isn't strong against it, because not only is CC a really strong spell, but it can be used four times in one game.
---
and aslo casual still has more freedom in what decks can work compared to higher lader ranks(which you want cause golden epic at end of month)
---
Thanks :]
---
No it’s the card itself that makes it 1 no matter what.
---
I had a guy do this a lot. Removed him eventually without a word, because it got annoying. I’m pretty sure I would have gotten scammed too
---
Just happened to me again lmao.
---
. . . CC cheats mana. Even if you use it on a 6-drop instead of an 8-drop, you still net a 6-drop for only 3 mana, and can likely do it again next turn.
---
It's strongly change cost to 1. So even if it costs zero, when it's effect triggers it will cost (1).
---
Good lord, what kind of ritual did you preform to pull that off?
---
I miss FoN roar so much... downvote me all you want
---
Token is not a tier 1 deck. Heck, I won even with pogos against him.
---

---
Bye ... again I guess?
---
Tldr; when people can't handle a game as what it is: something fun to pass the time
---
tupper#1565 also have quest to trade
---
Murloc Shammy and Token Druid are both fantastic IMO
---
I really don’t get your point. One is a spell with major tempo and the other is a DK with a slow yet value hero power. It’s like comparing shield block to southsea deckhand. One is armor and card gain, the other provides tempo.  I only said that you can’t compare their power levels.
---
I wouldn’t mind for a special event but for a perma thing it’ll be a no. Just too crazy to feel rewarding.
---
HSreplay has it favoured vs mage. I don't have premium so maybe it's different at legend but it's not winnable at all in my experience, much worse decks I'd rather be facing than Mage.
---
The currently best Hunter standard deck doesn't run Zul'Jin. But two copies of Master's Call. It's just a more versatile card, especially in a deck that runs nothing but beast tribe minions. 
---
Zul'Jin, while potentially powerful might screw you in combination with damage spells, and even with Master's Call and Tracking. 
---
Long story short, Master's Call is your better bet for now
---
thank you
---
Ranked is more expensive to get wins in because you need the best cards/decks which are always changing especially now with more frequent balance changes.
---
If they gave golden heroes for casual wins then there would be less incentive to play ranked (and for some people zero incentive to play ranked)
---
I do think "casual" is taking up space within Hearthstone. I do wish something would be done to make it more "casual." But I do not know the solution. 
---
Very least I wish they would talk about it. So many times I wish there was a place for fun non competitive decks only.  
---
Maybe give more rewards for climbing and playing rank. So it would incentives people to play rank.
---
And with that said that is part of the reason your wins do not count. If it did it would give people even less reasons to play ranked vs casual.
---
So I think in the short term(next couple years) you can not have both casual games count as wins and non competitive decks in casual.
---
Because people like to win. 99.995% of HS players are netdeckers playing the best decks possible.
---
People still complain about Big Priest when the Tier 1 Wild decks right now are Quest Mage, Odd Paladin, and Odd rogue. Murloc Shaman in Tier 2 is above Big Priest too. Quest Mage is the top meta defining deck now.
---
I could probably put up with it for $1000
---
It's been a while for me, but does it look like Firebat got chubbier, and Strifecro a bit thinner?
---
I wanna go to Kripps house

Snoops#0416, request sent.
---
This is painful to watch, literally non interactive, this game is getting sadder and sadder to watch and play
---
Yeah, that's pretty much it. Just forgot to say 'good Big Priests' in my comment. Since Big Priest is like the only Priest deck I ever see in wild I hadn't even bothered specifying it.
---
Snoops#0416, NA, trading 80g quest. Explain to me how to show the quest and I'll show, you go first. Thanks
---
I don't think you understand what I'm saying.  I know it has a few strong counters, but my point is that you tend to get absolutely stomped every time if you aren't playing a counter deck.  This means that the only really viable decks for serious climbing are mage and mage counters.  It pushes all decks that don't counter it out of the game, *even if those decks counter the t1 decks*.  
---
Mage either gets countered or it absolutely stomps. There is hardly any middle ground.  That's what it means to polarize the meta, and that's my main point.  That mage is creating a polarized field, because CC just destroys any deck that can't board clear.
---
I don't mind the restriction on streaming hearthstone, but a blanket restriction on any streaming sounds a bit much imo.
---
It depends on the meta. During Kobolds, Priest had a couple healthy variants. Raza was nerfed but still a completely viable deck, Dragon and Control decks were strong, and Shadow Visions allowed the Divine Spirit/Inner Fire combo to be viable but not top tier. Then Blizzard printed a fuck ton of Ressurect effects and nothing else even remotely playable and Priest has been pigeonholed into one type of deck.
---
By that definition every deck has mana cheating. I'm talking about 8/8s for 4 mana, or 2/7 taunts for 1. 
---
You're talking about regular ass hearthstone, like [this](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Faceless_Summoner)
---
Firebat’s losing face is the saddest thing in the known universe. It breaks my heart every time.
---
Yup, and I gotta scratch that itch every time by paging through the collection and tapping each and every one.
