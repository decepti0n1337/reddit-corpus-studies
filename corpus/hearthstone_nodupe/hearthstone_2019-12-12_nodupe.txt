Wow, cool interaction
---
---
---
I'm talking meta, and you're talking pure card value. Again, a lot of decks don't care about the stats which you are insisting on. Right now the meta is too aggro/too shaman heavy. Putting the game out of reach for your opponent by T6 is the norm. E.g. Vs a Brazen Zealot or Skyclaw on T4 or T5 (Using my deck as example and what works well against me), the 2/2 rush is way way more effective than a 4/5 taunt body, even on T5 itself. 
---

---
If you can't see how a 2/2 rush (or 4/3 rush for Shaman) disrupts Aggro-Tempo Paladin / Priest / Rogue / Warlock / Warrior, compared to a 4/5 taunt, then I'll leave it at that.
---
&gt;Except damage is always more flexible. No matter what 3 damage goes off. 
---
You can't hit things other than face with Lifedrinker. That's not very flexible at all.
---
What deck other than Quest Shaman is using Lifedrinker?
---
&gt;Shaman even if they don't bounce it does 12 damage and healing if they double both battle cries for a total of 10 mana and gets 2 3/3 bodies. 
---
1. Bounce effects are not played in Shaman.
---
2. I would hope a Quest deck of some sort could make a play like that by turn ten. Otherwise, why even use the Quest?
---
3. Face damage that isn't quickly leading to a win is a waste of cards and mana. Otherwise, Mind Blast and Sinister Strike would be two of the most played cards ever.
---
4. Shaman has always had pretty cheap and efficient Healing options.
---
   1. Healing Rain
---
   2. Healing Wave
---
   3. Jinyu Waterspeaker
---
   4. Witch's Brew
---
5. Slow control decks should have counters
---
From my experience i just find it as a desperate measure to try and get a game back from a losing position and this version of the deck can contest the board early and there just isn't a reason to include it in the deck (tested around 10 games but every single time i regretted including it)

Cards that invoke twice are no good if the shaman Gala still only needs two to upgrade.
---
Even worse when it summons two 2/1 with rush. 
---
Even worse when that leads to TWO 8/8s with rush.
---
Even worse when quest is active.
---
Even worse when Shudderwock is used.
---
Even worse with two 5/6 wolf taunts with no overload. 
---
Genuinely how did this all get approved? Like there’s some cards that are nuts sure, but this isn’t even fun or interactive.
---
I liked Ball of Spiders.
---
I mean Webspinner itself wasn't a great card, but it was one of my first Goldens and it means something to me.
---
Still trash though.
---
Highlander decks are some of the most expensive decks in the game. That's why most people aren't playing them.
---
I respect the "It's just day 1" sentiment, but sometimes you just know. Experienced players can use the eye test. You can see the profound amount of broken stuff a deck can do, and know there's no real counter.
---
I'd genuinely be shocked if Shaman isn't ninja nerfed within 2 weeks. Blizzard can't let everyone get disillusioned that quickly at this point. The only question is if the nerf they choose will be enough.
---
Nice.
---
Haha, I thought *my* lines were bad.
---
Sick. I got 350 or something on my first try and thought it was good, but this is insane. What deck did you use?
---
It's good, most legendaries are pretty good with it. I got Al'Akir from it(although, in a friendly) and it was extremely threatening. Better Al'Akir and I had 5 mana left to spend.
---
You can generally get a good legendary but the problem is the randomness+mana cost. If you get a trash legendary with this on 5, and a good one on 6, you've wasted a lot of mana just by saving it one turn(6 mana total). It's  weird to play on curve or with other cards and it's hard to plan ahead with it.
---
That being said, though, it's really good to get Zilliax, Hi'reek, Al'Akir, either Alexstrasza(in some situations), either Malygos(in the right deck), Murozond, the new 3 drop Priest legendary etc.
---
It's just a matter of luck....
---
You legitimately just have to hope they don't draw well. That is the only hope.
---
I made that joke when playing Bandersmosh yesterday. :(
---
The counter to quest-shaman has always been aggro/tempo decks, same as last expansion. 
---
Also, not sure what you mean by late game, but you can clear 4x 8/8s with rush as Hunter?
---
This has been a thing in hearthstone for years, why are you even here?
---
Gyrocopter is still not a good arena pick. A 100 on the Lightforge tierlist is the average of all the cards in the arena. An average card in your deck is around a 120. So sure, it's not a terrible pick for your deck, but I wouldn't call it good.
---
I hit 2807 with jade then hit turn limit. No pack. Rip.

Every 60 seconds in Africa, a minute passes.

I opened 107 packs and got 6 legendaries, and 16 epics, two of which were golden. I also ended up with around 2200 dust. Legendaries were Ysera, Flik Skyshiv, Zzeraku, Ancharrr, Frizz Kindleroost, &amp; Alexstraza. 
---
Not sure how good any of those are, but I was happy to get at least one legendary for a class I actually play (Flik). Most of my class-specific legendaries usually end up being for Pally, Mage, and Warlock and I never play those classes. I've been tempted to dust some of those cards, especially my golden legendary copies of Raid the Sky Temple &amp; Malygos, but I hate dusting legendaries even if I don't play the class.
---
I dealt over 1,000 damage with my C'thun Druid but then the game ended in a tie due to turn limit and I didn't get any reward. Definitely worth the half hour.
---
what mode is this?
---
Deck auto complete uses historical data of the highest win rate decks that matches with already selected cards and what you have in your collection.
---
No surprise it's useless in the first day, as it doesn't have any data on the new cards yet.
---
*cries in warlock*
---
Why must he have such smoll arms :/
---
Exactly my point they wonder why their player base has been dwindling.
---
You clear the 4x 8/8 with the quest hero power + swarm of locusts/shu'ma, or Veranus/unleash, while also developing threats. Shaman doesn't seem to have a ton of removal.
---
Flik seems to be Rogue's only hope against Shaman slamming down 4  8/8s.
---
It is close to an auto-include in most dragon decks. A big fatty that enables dragon synergy and draws when you put him down, it is quite useful.
---
Like sheep, the plural of Ysera is Ysera.
---
But very baddass-ly
---
30% beatable on average. Suggestion: Try tempo rogue, pirate warrior, highlander paladin, combo priest, zoo warlock, quest hunter, token druid to beat it. Just go face. 
---
Note sure about mage. Amongst all the classes, they seem most likely to have an alternative long term gameplan.
---
Not sure if sarcastic or not but it can happen and it is fine. If Alex is the thing you are worried about in this meta, than you got your priorities wrong
---

It hurts.

Thanks but I'll prefer not to resort to that.
---
You couldnt just deaktivate shaman? Im asking for a friend.
---
Can you nerf it while you're at it?  K thanks.
---
Quest isn't a problem in wild.
---
I agree, it's overpowered right now. The 65+% win rates these shaman decks have is proof of that, I think.
---
One possible counter strategy is to play a burn heavy deck. The shaman deck depends on rush minions and you can play around that a bit by not playing many minions. Weapon play + Burn spells can be an effective option, though the shaman deck still can draw the 5/6 taunts which will just fuck you up.
---
Yuuup. Spirit claws for them, a lack of meaningful options for anyone else.
---
What is Love?
---
my 331 / 72 doesn't feel as good now

My sincerest apologies.
---
galakrond shaman is OP without quest
---
Opened my 100 pack deal:
---
Free golden Waxadred
---
Flik, Chenvaala, Ysera, Kaahrj, Dragonbane
---
Didn’t count the epics, but they included 3 Grizzled Wizard, 4 Ramming Speed, 4 Dragon’s Pack, so many of the unusable ones got dusted right away to craft a Kronx.
---
I wanted Kronx, Dragonbane and Flik so I’m fairly happy
---
Thanks!
---
I was so excited to have fun with the big dragons! The new galakrond deck doesn't even run the shaman dragon! :(
---
I guess "she" goes both ways... So you might as well do the same and steal her new man.
---
No, it's all intended. The rush portion of the Boom Hero Card is a battlecry, and whenever a card plays another card it does not trigger battlecries.
---
Yes, someone with HSreplay access on the CompetitiveHS thread just corrected me for the same thing, thanks.

I’d appreciate as a back pocket but I don’t really have the dust to craft anything else. Been runnin my Gala Warlock and having a lot of fun except against certain matchups.

Bet you play shaman huh
---
It's dumb they did it in the first place 😣
---
I don’t even know what people mean when they say things like that. Zoolock has always been among the most engaging decks in the game. Particularly at the moment, as you can make a “fun” (or what I assume you mean by that word) version of the archetype by making it into a Highlander variant. 
---
I personally used this Highlander Zoolock list to reach Legend, starting from Rank 4. Granted it’s gone through many variations sinceit’s the start of a new card set, and I’ve naturally been experimenting. But this is what it is at the current moment, and it’s how it’s been for the bulk of the climb. I have a positive winrate with it against all Shaman lists I’ve faced.

I miss Ben Brode
---
I was probably running an unoptimized list but I found I was really struggling against highlander mage yesterday. They have a lot of tools to control the board and when they then drop a few big minions it's really hard to recover.
---
He's right.  Murazond isn't bugged.  It's simply a bad card.
---
It wouldn't take that long for you to count them yourself by searching 'Dragon' and putting the collection in crafting mode
---
*laughs in fierce monkey*
---
Step 5: Play shudderwock
---
When he dies: Baby don’t hurt me
---
even when i’m playing the most heavy control focused ultra omega slow priest deck with 21K dust - i still can’t outvalue shaman on turn 10 - 15
---
&gt; (4) Its actually well-designed, being weaker than a fireball. It also requires other cards to bring out its full potential. Hardly anyone calls it broken.
---
Nowadays at 5 mana it is.
---
Right... So he opened 100 packs, got 1 legendary from the first 10, 1 from the next 40, and 1 from the 40 after that. Now he’s 10 packs into his next 40.
---
What if it's a snowstorm?
---
Overload is not part of a battlecry. Invoke is. A card may say "battlecry: do a thing". Overload (1), but just because the overload is after the battlecry doesn't mean its part of the battlecry.
---
I finally survived the four 8/8s with Rush as my Galakrond Rogue only for him to drop Shudderwok and crush me.  The tempo and value from that deck is just insane. I am not sure why they gave the strongest galakrond battlecry to the class that could not only double it but also get it a 3rd time with shudderwok.
---
Tits and sticking it to China are better tbh
---
It's badder.

Or put the number of battlecry minions to be played at 10+. You can easily finish the Quest by turn 5-6 when it’s a struggle to complete quests like Unseal the Vault at turn 10. But your solution is much better. Sick of this overpowered legendary quest.
---
Just a heads up, Zephrys doesn’t take into account the mana discount from Dragoncaster, like how he does with Kalecgos etc.
---
&gt; purposefully overlook rule-breaking posts if they're popular enough
---
Not true. My meme image post was removed even though it got 900+ upvotes in less than a day.
---
Honestly I thought the Shaman cards were bad before the invoke card were released as shit like Nithogg and Bandersmosh will rarely see play. But then we saw the Invoke and Galakrond Shaman package and instantly Shaman is again at number 1
---
I got pulled into playing hearthstone after 2 years away because of battlegrounds. Highlander hunter is basically a deck made of everything I love doing in hearthstone. I figured I’d buy packs and give them another chance because dragons are cool. Turns out the game is unplayably balanced, so I guess it’s good I left this game behind.
---
We are friends now! Hello friend!
---
How long can this go on...
---
It's her tongue
---
On the same tier as a card that got nerfed?
---
Don't worry, you don't need the deck of a rank 20 player who says Zoolock counters quest shaman.
---
&gt; I feel bad for everyone who pre-ordered this lol
---
I feel swell thank you very much. I also enjoy the sprinkling the salt in your post. Tasty!
---
My camper warrior with 2 Brawl 2 Plague 2 warpath 1 new Deathwing and still dead lol
---
Pyro equality your own shirvallah sounds like efficient use of mana to me 😏
---
35 new cards are more then a month away and will (most likely) be split in wings over a course of several (probably 4-5) weeks, meaning that by only comleating the day to day quests you should be able to have enough gold by the time the adventure comes out, so i would feel free to spend the gold now
---
Then I guess someone should draw some smoke on that mutant.
---
For the people who dont understand that "strictly better" =/= "always better, even in unlikely situations"
---
Brutal
---
I got 900+ decorations. Should we be aiming for higher scores? I mean, a pack is a pack.
---
I think just removing rush on the 2/1's is the best option. That way playing gal still feels good but you're weak to aggro.
---
yes, but there were so little decks who did not play Azure drake on curve. It was used for the draw an the draw alone.
---
Actually, I’m pretty sure everyone but Rogue and Druid technically have 3.

---
Out if 83
---
Yeah, no shit.
---
Shaman is out of control, and they’re here to infuriate for a whole year since their quest is smack dab in the middle of Saviors of Uldum.
---
I dont understand how people can keep play shaman. It’s beeing played all the time, it’s boring to play vs and as shaman.
---
Care to post decklist?
---
Oh you’re right. I don’t recognize or remember a lot of these. Legit never seen Thunder King or Lazulcbefore.
---
Shaman has been extremely good ever since saviors of uldum, and this expansion has done nothing but expanding on that. Especially since Shaman has the best invoke cards/power
---
Got confused with Y’Shaarj.
---
I'm not entirely sure where I sit on this.
---
Double Invoke on 1 card in the class with the best Invoke is very stupid.
---
10/12 taunt for 5 mana with an easy to achieve condition is pretty stupid.
---
32/32 rush + 5/2 weapon for 9 mana setting up for a 9 mana 6/6 + 24/20 rush + 5/2 weapon (and so much more) is a stupidly strong late game.
---
The deck can get mauled by a Rouge deathrattle package or a high rolling aggro deck (face hunter and pirate warrior can both take games from shaman). 
---
The deck runs 7+ 5 drop cards, putting it squarely in the midrange/value camp of decks. I feel like a strong late game deck is important to keep aggro from completely dominating the game. If Blizz were to emphasize this idea by lightly nerfing the early game (say by changing the invoke to 1/1 rush or just a regular 2/1) I feel like it would bring the performance consistency of the deck in line without gutting it like most people want.
---
I struggled to get around 250 damage, and here you are doing stuff like this. Congrats, Also to anyone reading this, preist hero power will not kill the enemies, it will just swap the stats and add some health points. So if you thought you could cheese the enemy minions with taunt, think again.
---
While I agree, it has been a day, we need to wait for the meta to develop more
---
Lol what are you talking about? Control wins games in the late game through value. Control decks need a win condition, and Rexxar is one of the best win conditions for control that hunter has. 
---
Using a steady amount of large minions is absolutely a strategy that control decks utilize in Hearthstone l, and Rexxar is a single card that produces an infinite amount of them. 
---
What is your definition of control that would exclude Rexxar? I would say it isn’t one of the cards that actually does the controlling, but even that isn’t true, considering it’s Battlecry is deal 2 damage to all enemy minions. There are few Hunter cards that embody control more than DK Rexxar.

At the start? It usually doesn’t get much better
---
I dont understand how people can keep play ~~shaman~~ meta deck. It’s beeing played all the time, it’s boring to play vs and as ~~shaman~~ meta deck.
---
Yeah just like Shudderwock Shaman at the launch of Witchwood?
---
PS, I think Shaman looks very strong, but 60%+ winrate decks at launch aren't surprising, lots of strong decks get a lot weaker when people stop trying to make garbage like "some flavor of control rogue" and "control priest in general" work
---
What is this idiotically designed crap? I did like 700 damage and the game was never going to end so I conceded and got jack shit? Warn me if you're going to waste my f'n time.
---
My experience (albeit after only about a dozen games) is it should be a high tier three to mid tier two option. If you already have Goru and some of the Epics like Wispering Woods (you should if you played RoS Token Druid), you might as well since the rest of the deck is commons and rares.
---
I've played the deck exactly once. I just realize that it's shortsighted and unreasonable to expect blizzard to do anything less than 2 days into a new expansion. Everyone else needs to relax.
---
And honestly it would make sense to change the wording to have overload and then the battlecry but if blizzard is going to let an extremely overpowered deck stay so strong and add support without nerfing it, I doubt they're doing anything about a small, mostly cosmetic change like this
---
Very expensive, but the fun-value makes up for it! 
---
Side-note: I didn't have enough dust to craft Siamat, so I just replaced it with Ysera. 
---
Enjoy!
---
Yeah I could tell they were garbage too. Even the 3/3 legendary.
---
There can't be that many people who find pretending to be dumb fun.
---
This reminds me of cthun druid. The most busted tier 0 deck ever, day 1 in the meta. A week later it was hovering around tier 2, then it took a nosedive for a while before resurging as a specific counterdeck around the time right before next release.
---
Just compare Chronobreaker with Crazed Netherwing, priest got shafted.
---
You can't have constant balance changes in a card game. Choosing a new deck to play/craft is a large investment. You can't just switch from Quest Shaman to Reno Mage on a whim.
---
That’s a pretty absurd viewpoint on balancing the game
---
Secret Keeper still fucks me up when I see the new art. I'll never get used to it.
---
Forgot Liadrin from Paladins.
---
Yes but most Priest players were hoping for something else to play than IF combo.
---
Pretty please
---
Shaman has King Rastakhan
---
Waxachicken rises! ...  again and again and again...
---
Also, I shockingly have only run into 3 shamans from rank 20 to 10, but this deck surprisingly crushed them before they could pull off their 9 mana turn.
---
Finally opened my packs - 60 from bundle and 45 from gold I saved.

Team 5 doesn’t have a clue how to balance their game
---
Flik Skyshiv does a pretty good job of dealing with the 8/8 rushes when they are summoned. You could even shadowstep it and keep it for the second wave if they are playing quest with shudderwock.
---
Quest just slows down a deck that is already insane. Quest will give you more value, but you already generate so much value in Shaman with your galakrond alone at such an early point that you kill value decks before they can pop off and you out value non-value decks. If you get unlucky or you opponent gets lucky, you can just shudderwock and get insane value a second time anyway. No need for doubling it either time.
---
7 mana 16/16 rush equip a 5/2 weapon and upgrade your hero power. You can easily have it invoked by turn 7 by playing cards that are well statted (all the invoke cards are already good by themselves).
---
Quest is fine, but it just slows down an already amazing deck and makes it worse against almost every matchup you'll come across right now.
---
I think it would be fine if people netdeck’ed different decks. But it’s basically only shaman and different versions of it right now. I’m glad they made battlegrounds.
---
2 months later: Same shit.
---
Well, if you get rid of the quest it frees up a lot of space for other early game stuff I assume.  You get rid of slower opening stuff like a 1/1 turn 2 for more proactive minions and more early stats that set you up for taking advantage of all the rushes.
---
Honestly I was super excited to play ranked after waiting so long for evolve to rotate out, but these shaman decks make me not want to touch ladder.So far filled with shaman, pirate warriors and surprisingly some warlock
---
Tess is much more useful since she play cards which you played over multiple turns.
---
Can sombody explain the wisp sitting in the boarcontrol highlander warlock decklist? I've went through it a few times and I don't quite understand it's inclusion.
---
I think maybe they should just remove Nightmare Amalgan. It is simply too strong as it is and nerfing it statwise or somethign wont do. Also removing it would be a small buff to Curator as it would make him the only one who can make a strong amalgan (except if Rafaam steals one).   
---
Also Cobalt Guardian could easily move up a tier. its simply too easy to have it regain its Divine Shield multiple times.  
---
Coldlight seer back to T3 would be alright.
---
Maybe put Sneeds Shredder in T5 or remove it altogether. It simply is far too weak for a T6. The legendaries it can summon are simply not good enough in the long run.  
---
Poisonous really needs to be adressed too. Especially the Divine Shield+Poison combo you mentioned.
---
I also never was a friend of Wrath Weaver being T1 while Pogo-Hopper is T2. Weaver is far easier to buff up for cheap.
---
Well, used to be able to.  Some current hand buff cards don't show which one got buffed.
---
Most of them are not inefficient at all. That’s just rogues.
---
 
---
It is pretty bugged.
---
Play \[grizzled wizard\] and your hero power summon defender which appears on your opponent board. Steal weapon cannot attack.
---
attack with high damage like 1024 will instant end the brawl.
---
Rank is kind of irrelevant.  You can have a good or bad game at any rank.  If it was 100 games at rank 3 that'd say a lot more.
---
Yes I believe so.
---
I'm not too big on ladder, hopefully we get something soon.Im hoping that there's some huge meta shift or something where shaman is just excluded as a ok niche class for some time to just relax from shamanstone for some time now.I just want to play without having to worry about everything being destroyed by rush, more 8 8 with rush and then the inevitable shudderwock.

Giving me flash backs to when i played mtg during Esper control last year. 5 mana teferi loops with his emblem up
---
No? Stats arent linked to the card name. It may be inconsistent naming/design, but its completely according to how I expect it to behave given the rules. 
---
We've already seen from dungeon run and now battlegrounds that base stats arent direcrly tied to the card-name anyways. But yes, I do understand its confusing for players if they dont expect the rules to work like that.
---
Galakrond shaman on suicide watch after seeing this tier 0 deck, you are truly a saint OP, I thank you
---
Warrior, rogue, and warlock all have fairly inefficient invoke cards. Priest's are good, but slow because the effect is random and doesn't affect the board state. Shaman's are actively insane.
---
Just scored 1321 ;) check out my post in new under this one
---
Fml
---
And this is why everyone immideatly hates the idea of any new pirates, I'm beginning to understand
---
Can I see a list, I love the trees so much and I have been experimenting with GORU GORU. He’s so fun.
---
I think replacing Gentle Megasaur is a good start. I don't hate giving Murloc builds a specific reason to rank to 6, but currently Megasaur just gives Murlocs the rock, the paper, and the scissors in the form of Divine shield / poison (and health, but that's not really a Megasaur issue). 
---
I don't even hate King Bagurgle. Murlocs are always stronger together, and Bagurgle really unites the Murloc package in a very flavorful way. If Murlocs didn't have such a quick way to suddenly all gain poison and divine shield, I think the power level of Bagurgle would be pretty fair for a rank 5 card.
---
Also, Primalfin Lookout is really strong. I buy this card even on non-Murloc builds. The fact that it can discover Bagurgle really pushes it over the edge, in my opinion. The power gets even more compounded with Brann, who is also frankly extremely powerful.
---
They are just too good at all stages of the game and have very few weaknesses.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As for Rafaam; honestly just remove this character. I hate him. He just feels bad to play against. Even if his hero power costed 2 or 3 I'd still hate him. I hate giving him my minions. He creates scenarios where you have to consider playing sub-optimally to avoid giving him easy triples or good cards. The hero power is relevant and practically all points of the game. Just rotate him and never bring him back. /rant
---
😂 Worth and updoot?
---
Definitely worth an upvote lol
---
Haha thanks
---
Decklist?
---
I'm trying out some rogue as well and would like to try anything out
---
Enjoying myself at rank 15 with Treant and Tree Druid.
---
And not only does shudderwock summon 2 8/8s with rush, but it also does 12 face damage, heal them for 8, and fills their hands with lackies, spells, and dragons.
---
\-Galakrond, the Tempest
---
Just play pirate warrior beats shaman at least 80% of the time it’s the only deck I’ve seen reliably and consistently dumpster gala/quest sham
---
Enjoying myself at rank 24 (because I’ve just now started playing ranked since I feel like my deck can compete,) with Galakrond Dragons &amp; taunt Warrior.
---
Wow. A pally actually almost defeated a shaman. We’re getting somewhere these days...
---
Ok nice!
---
The other galakronds are so fun too and they're virtually unplayable rn because they aren't god tier levels of broken
---
Unless you are looking to put resources into more than one deck I would wait, it's a little early to tell. I've been playing Highlander Dragon Mage, and it's been great, but it is an expensive deck and hard to say if it will remain competitive.
---
If you are really itching to spend some dust though Faceless Corruptor and Dragonqueen Alexstraza are both strong neutral cards
---
Tbh shaman has been my favorite class for as long as I’ve been on the game ( Whispers of the Old Gods), and even I’m pretty annoyed with how ridiculous shaman is right now.
---
[Faceless corruptor]
---
I ran both.
---
That's literally what I did, and haven't lost a game. I've only played a handful of standard games, though.
---
Maybe not nerf Galakronds-around cards, just nerf the quest.
---
Not really. I run into degenerate deck that win 1/20 times and they pull off that 1 win. Ran into 5 different dragon druid deck in wild that shuffled 20+ dragons with elek or brann or both . Good times.
---
Wasnt it "knocks" instead of "pillages"?
---
If I understand your problem correctly, this is intended. Invoke twice to upgrade, invoke twice to upgrade again.
---
The Quest is too easy to fulfill and needs nerfing, badly.
---
I just wish they let people create game modes, imagine where you could queue into a custom game mode that didn’t bore the fuck out of you like standard does. Custom card bans. Imagine a mode where you could play where Shaman doesn’t even exist? Problem solved.
---
How do i link a card?
---
You vs the girl he told you not to worry about
---
I pick DW from the paladin dragon option against Shaman too. However, I still get overunned by the 2/1 so fast after playing DW...
---
You are both right. It was one the class into was given to and the meta it was in.
---
I got that too on turn 4. Rip my opponent.
---
Also nerf Shaman pls
---
That deals 4 damage to a target of your choiche lmao
---
The problem is battlecry synergise with each other between shaman archetypes.
---
Quest is all about battlecry. Whole galakrond package is battlecry. Dragons are mainly battlecry minions. The class legendary super powerhouse shuddersock replay all battlecry. It becomes more and more powerful each set when strong battlecry minion release, such as the new faceless this time. And yet shaman got the best invoke cards among all classes. 
---
This is ridiculous. And we need to wait for a few months at least before a balancing patch.
---
This is the problem we know they will be so light handed with any nerf that it will literally be 2 months before standard is even remotely balanced gg until then to any fun.
---
and you can mutate the worthless 5 minion afterwards. nice design
---
I like Galakrond (shaman) a lot, I just don't like Dragon's pack:/
---
Can you please explain
---
Thank you good sir. That makes sense.
---
That's not a fact.
---
Yeah the BG update is not that fun to me. I think they are as good at balancing BG as they are at balancing and adding to standard format. Which is not good at all.
---
Without Grumble it's not even remotely possible but even with Grumble it wouldn't be good, power level of HS now compared to HS at Witchwood launch is ridiculously higher than it was then
---
Pirates and Shamanstone still continues.
---
When someone does better than the smart kid on 1 test:
---
I really dont know how this passed the office’s door
---
“Trust me! Keep Hearthstone great!”
---
Reminds me of The Shaman Stone of a couple years ago
---
There isn’t anything really to figure out. It’s pretty much get punched in the face or a coin flip.
---
It’s day two of the expansion.........
---
Give the dust time to settle.
---
Put your deathrattle out there quick as you can and use HP more often than most decks
---
I got two words for you; Jeppeto Joybuzz
---
It is an option, u can got it via Bog Slasher if u dont spam ur hands with lackeys before. It's give an opportunity not OTK strategy.
---
4K with pogos
---
Yeah, I can only see the Sathvorath, Azure Drake 2.0 and the faceless corruptor making it into the deck to make it better.
---
What about rogue? 🤔
---
I'm mad that the Thumder King actually has a name but is called thunder king DUMB
---
imo the shaman quest needs to be changed to 'Your next battlecry this turn triggers twice' having it trigger all battlecries twice every turn for 2 mana is ridiculous, the quest is the issue more than anything tbh
---
Wow I'm sure they got that mogu turn 2 into an 8/8 like it happened to me! No? It didn't .. aww so its not as bad your poor thing
---
This. I wanna play high dragon mage but not if I'm gonna get destroyed by shaman. I already have ptsd from last expansion don't need it again.
---
How does this pity timer works. Does it varies from expansion to expansion? Also, has hearthstone ever confirmed about pity timer algorithm officially?
---
Just curious.
---
People are playing garbage at higher ranks too?
---
Same thing happened to me, druid vs shaman
---
Somehow I was keeping up, and they cast double dragon pack and it was instantly game over for me
---
When I play vs other galakrond i feel like they basically give up tempo for a turn making it a weak turn and a chance for me to catch up and press an advantage before they drop the big boy Galakrond.
---
When I play vs Shaman I feel like their Galakrond turns just push me back and establish complete board control.
---
A 5 mana 3/3 summon two 2/1s with rush made me think it was like overload 3 the first time I saw it because there is no way they can have a 7/5 in stats with partial rush while completing half their Galakrond.
---
Its also just the most boring consistent Galakrond Preists kills random minions, Warrior Draws random cards and buffs them Rogue draws but discounts, Warlocks Summons random demons.
---
Shaman just summons a fuckton of stats into play incredibly boring but incredibly powerful
---
Gotta agree with you on the viability of the strategy given the cards, but with all the value Shudder gives with the Lackeys and other Galakrond battlecries, bringing him back up once to your hand is actually enough. A game plan which solely relies on going infinite isn’t gonna achieve much more then 2 Shudders in a single game. Mostly because of Grumble as you said because the cost reductions is what makes it all come together at the end
---
&gt; The deck is the literal definition of Tier 0 
---
Actually that was Sniplock. Most people don’t know how bad that was bc most people don’t play wild but NOTHING will ever be as broken as Sniplock was. That was true tier 0
---
5.5k and no pack
---
I do believe they are releasing a bundle where you can get 6 packs from like 5 or 6 different expansions in standard. If you can buy it multiple times maybe buy it 4 times, that's 24 packs for like100 bucks
---
Yep. Everyone on the ladder is playing garbage or shaman.
---
Warlocks is pretty fun and cheap with a good consistent theme but often you're one off a full Galakrond too.
---
No, the most recent example of that was Sniplock
---
So you can easily disable animations...  can you please do that for battlegrounds? I would like to play it.
---
Am I the only one who’s found that control warrior does pretty well at countering Galaquest Shaman??
---
chiliboy#1909 EU trading 80G - ill show first and you go first!
---
Until the inevitable nerf patch, this is officially the worst state ladder has ever been in. I was excited for all the new stuff they added but it looks like its back to battlegrounds for a couple weeks.
---
Deck code and substitute for zilliax?
---
Do that in wild with the taunt warrior quest power, now that is a better dream.
---
The one that adapts every time if hit face was  better
---
We’re you...here at all during the last 2 months? All shaman did was highroll into an uncontrollable board by turn 3 and up. In other words, eat my rng, ya meta scum.
---
FACT: It's been 2 days
---
Alright, gang, let's see who this card really is!
---
It sparks a lot of joy for me
---
To put things in perspective, Dr. Boom is on the turn you play him, 9 mana gain 7 armor. In comparison, Shaman Galakrond is 9 mana spawn FOUR 8/8s WITH RUSH **AND** EQUIP A 5/2 WEAPON. Oh, but I guess you only gain 5 armor, so that makes it fair. /s
---
Yeah, I tried a Dragon Paladin, it’s certainly not the best but I feel that I have a chance against anything besides Questshaman. Even if I get a good start their whole deck seems to be manacheat and rush... how did they thought it was a good idea to make this deck even stronger?
---
A)  HS Replay win rates for specific decks are absurdly inflated.
---
B) Unless I’m mistaken, we don’t have the “try to eliminate the dumb dumbs” filter on.
---
No buckets anymore, but the occurrence rate should be lowered for sure.
---
It's on our radar
---
Yeah fuck this card it’s so broken
---
I thought that when corrupt the waters first came out, and all they did was make it stronger. I’m hoping for nerfs, but this might be the expansion I play the least of. I can’t stand another few months of bs shamanstone.
---
Yeah happened to me earlier but it seems normal now
---
There's also two if you have a shitty token lmao
---
I was inclined to argue "If you're really hitting that many, just queue a counter to it." But according to HSreplay, there are literally no bad matchups - the "worst matchup" is 50% in the mirror. So it really is that overpowered.
---
Within a few days, though, the meta will settle down a little and people will find the counter. I'd suggest you just take a break from standard until then.
---
No. In my turn 2 I played the breath and passed it. In his turn while he's playing his card, I realized that I got the mana and screenshotted it. You know there's a small delay in history bar. He won the game thanks to turn 4 Nozdormu
---
I'm playing Highlander Mage too ! Yeah Ysera seems a bit greedy and maybe you can try vulpera and keysmith too theyre powerful as well. Also imo Dragoncaster carries this deck honestly. Its so powerful 6 mana power of creation + 4/4 body lol.
---
i had great sucess with priest
---
uh no?
---
Flavor text - 'But... no taunt'
---
The Bonemare buff could go face.
---
[removed]
---
Shaman nerfs
---
Don’t worry I love the shaman class and I too absolutely hate this fucking deck. It literally has zero weakness, and Bonemare 2.0 is really not helping the case.
---
No, you don’t, [[spirit of the shark]] only works on minions.
---
Their only regret is probably making one class too OP with their blatantly OP set.
---
Forgive me if I’m wrong, but isn’t the spirit of the shark *minion’s* battlecries and combos only?
---
The question is what game are people subbing away to? I played a bunch of MTG back in the day - was considering checking that out online. Any other good mobile games people can recommend until this Shaman thing gets nerfed to oblivion?
---

Bonemare is still a 4/4 without another minion

No it was just tested poorly. How many cards actually generate cards for you. Maybe a couple hundred.
---
They definitely have test clients which allow them to set hand size and similar. 
---
It should take one day, maximum to quickly run through all the card generating cards with a hand size of 10 or 11 to see if it works. 
---
That's the point of testing. You don't just test one scenario and assume it works for all.
---
Intended
---
What am I even saying, shaman has been the best class for a long time right before expansion was here, murloc shaman eh...
---
Arena feels kind of ass too. Poachers are not fun, nor Corruptors. But beyond that it's pretty good. I enjoyed some games with a classic-styled mage deck the other day.
---
Just play miracle rogue. Tons of lackies and smaller drops to deal with early stuff, runs faceless themselves for midgame, can get fat minions starting around turn 4, can kill the 8/8s with flitz, 4/5 win conditions with Edwin, 2 questing, and with 1 togwaggle scheme make deck of kronx or togwaggles for huge returns. Just constant board pressure/control with spells lackies taunts and rush
---
I’m a goofy goober yay
---
Has that ever happened before? Truly one in a trillion chance.
---
Uh, yes? Bonemare is 4/4, and another 4/4 with a token.
---
Atleast we have battlegrounds now.
---
I play mecha'thun druid   
---
It's ez win. fuck you tavern brawl 4Head
---
Us wild players have been dealing with some of the most powerful Shudderwock decks out there. I actually managed the reach legend with quest shudderwock shaman back in september. This is all to say that 30 minutes ago I got beat by an infinite shudderwock that played corruptor. 
---
The pain is real, just not for standard.
---
So annoying!!! 2.5K+ wins for me with Priest and I can count on one hand the number of times since Naxx Priest has had a tier one deck in Standard. They just seem clueless with the class. Uninspired and lazy design.
---
It also doesn't have the taunt it provides or rush though...and costs more to boot. At least you can still remove something with this with nothing else in play. Card's kinda silly.
---
If ducking control warrior can’t kill this deck we are all doomed holy.
---
Lol implying wild gets anywhere near the amount of support from Blizzard that standard does
---
&gt;After a pre-determined amount of time and after a lot of whining from the playerbase, Blizzard will nerf the cards so the game is more balanced again (and yay Blizzard listens to our concerns).
---
The trick is to wait until most of the playerbase crafted the deck. Once they are out of dust, you then nerf 3 common cards, rendering all their legendary and epic worthless.
---
It as. If you are curious you can check the image on google, altough sometimes it appears here in the sub.
---
Bad comparison.
---
I genuinely thought quest nerf would slow down deck because I went 17-3 with quest yesterday losing only to 2 glakrond quest shamans and 1 pirate warrior. Quadruple 8/8s won me many games. In my defense, I didn't know the average stats.
---
Let's not forget that we don't adjust our win percentage according to the average of some website. So individual feedbacks may show difference with the statistics.
---
More or less, except it's energy cost is colorless so you can use any color to pay for it, and instead of discarding your hand you shuffle it into your deck, and it only affects you. Though there are some things to keep in mind when it comes to the Pokemon compared to Magic. For starters it's an attack, so it ends your turn immediately so you can't use the new resources you just got until next your turn. Also in Pokemon your energy resources are attached directly to the Pokemon and they can't be moved around or utilized by other cards, or at least not very easily, so putting energy on the Cleffa to use it's attack is technically a sunken resource since obviously you'd have to start putting your energy on to something that can actually work towards winning you the game. Of course, I say technically, the attack was insanely OP regardless, and pretty much every deck until it rotated ran four of them.
---
Didn't the say on the reveal stream that Dragon's Pack is fine because if you have spend your earlier turns invoking, you were doing suboptimal tempo plays?
---
Fucking hilarious.
---
Alt + F4
---
I was wondering why I was seeing this deck make a comeback out of seemingly nowhere.
---
Either raise mana cost by 2 or give it - 1/-1
---
Then Shudderwock :)
---
Oh yeah totally. I wouldn't recommend dusting your whole collection. If OP wants to go competitive I would say keep your cards and build a budget deck and try climbing to rank 10/5.
---
An earth shattering play!
---
Stop playing the fucking game then you edgy teenager.
---
Right next to "fuck it, charge"
---
50 shades of Shaman
---
my solution is to wait for the rope on 
---
every 
---
single
---
turn
---
against shamans. if im not having fun neither will they. maybe if enough people will do this the braindead netdeckers will move to something else?
---
Better to craft a budget version of the deck you like and don't de too many cards, you never know! I usually never de cards in order to make new decks, I try to play with what I have (and budget decks)
---
It wasn't overpowered but it was overplayed, so people were sick of playing against it by the time Dolm in the Tomb came out.
---
&gt; Dragon's Pack may be tricky to deal with.
---
I see warriors with Supercolliders.
---
Simply amazing
---
It’s part of the nature of the community to gravitate to the strongest deck to increase winrate. If shaman gets nerfed considerably, most people will find the next best thing which will start the cycle all over again. If it isn’t shamanstone it might as well be magestone next.
---
Problem is tho is that as soon as people discover control warrior is a reliable counter all shaman will have to do to answer that is run platebreaker and use the more aggressive battlecries again like wasp and the 3/3 bounce minion
---
That card has such amazing meme potential tho
---
I liked rush as a replacement to charge but atm it seems like they're just slapping it on things
---
The Buff Warsong Commander needs
---
You don't really need a small minion, though. I've had my fair share of situations where I won because I hit something with a big minion, transformed it with Corruptor and hit again. Losing a few attack points is oftentimes less important than point removal which Corruptor provides.
---
And since the current set is extremely heavy in battlecries barely any deck loses important effects by transforming a hurt, big minion into a slightly smaller one
---
Silverback Patriach actually hasn't been 100% powercrept, because of the Beast Niche; or class restrictions [IE: Fierce Monkey]
---
This is 100% powercreep.
---
You'll spend about 5K dust and maybe get refunded about 800. That's the way it works. This is why you don't craft anything right away.
---
People still complaining about Res Priest in 2019, really...
---
Me as a f2p just played ZooKrond because it has only 2 epics.
---
Rubbish, control galakrond Priest craps all over it.
---
Just tech against rogue next time buddy
---
Ye old 7/5 on an empty board 
---
Or the even better 5 mana 3/3 deal 2 damage two two enemies or 4 to one
---
For future reference, just load the app on your phone and don't close the PC client. It will auto-kick you and you can continue without a problem.

It is early but Galakrond combo priest seems to have some success hsreplay probably doesn't have enough data to rate it yet but nohandgamer hit rank1 legend with a variation of it. [Decklist here](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/galakrond-priest-1-legend-nohandsgamer-descent-of-dragons/) I've had some success with it with some anti-shaman tech could be actually good (rn still a bit greedy 4-5 cards can prob be easily cut)
---
Because it is not fun to play against it ever and ℅90 of the wild population is res priest
---
I went 12-2 against Shaman with only quest Hunter from rank 4 to legend. The two losses were when I drew the worst I possibly could have against a nuts draw Shaman. 
---
I'm pretty sure quest Hunter is favored; it's just a harder deck so most people aren't very good with it.
---
Its not an awful pick from a power of creation
---
Well, we all surely know the routine by now, we just need to suffer for a month or so until we can get the inevitable nerfs.
---
thanks!
---
I really hate rush mechanic. They are not that bad playing against if your opponent plays a control deck but otherwise it is bad. At least for me. I can say that this expansion my least liked so far. I don't want to be harsh, especially this early. However I feel like there are lots of badly designed cards. I mean making lots of strong cards and trying to create a game that gives lots of opportunity to both sides for swing turns maybe sounds not bad but in reality it is really frustrating and it comes down to who will draw that card first. I don't even enjoy the games when I won. I don't feel that I made the right calls or so I mostly feel lucky. Sorry for my English btw.
---
Plate Breaker in no way wins you that matchup. You get rid of some armor maybe twice with Shudder but you still have to deal with a ton of Control tools that will constantly clear your board and they'll just get that armor back after some time.
---
Ya know, I quit hearthstone like, 2 years ago, and I have to ask, why are you all still playing? Blizzard keep doing shit like this, making really busted cards to benefit the fast agro decks because shorter, easier games is what the casual players want. 
---
Blizzard don't give a shit about balance or making their game good, they just want it to feel satisfying when you draw the nuts and blow your opponent out of the water. 
---
So take my advice: Quit hearthstone and start playing an actual game instead.
---
Rolling fireball, same cost as flamelance, same targeting, more potential damage
---
Still leaves a 5/1 at worst and you also need to face tank 5 dmg.
---
So? Wild is just that, Wild! Which means devs don’t care about it, there’s no balancing in it unless it’s an absolute last resort, and in fact some of the player base prefers it that way because they just want to have fun with broken stuff. Broken and absurd strategies are the norm for wild, whereas ideally something like that should never happen in standard.
---
“Tier 0” strategies are bound to happen in wild and sniplock is only the most recent, however this is one of the only cases in standard history (of the last 2 years) if things don’t change soon
---
Play druid with no target eleminate spell/minion makes the game hard. You have to go harder on the board than the opponent. And shaman does that but easier.
---
This guy should had been a neutral legendary
---
Murozond should not be a 1-card "I do everything you did but in a single card" effect. It's already strong as-is and doesn't need to duplicate Battlecries. That would be pretty un-fun design.
---
Descent of Dragons appears to be "Fight broken stuff with broken stuff." But it becomes much less interesting if it's "Fight broken stuff with... the exact same broken stuff."
---
Plus it's not like its usefulness against Battlecry Shaman would be much better. Murozond wouldn't be doubling Battlecries himself and you still don't get to target a lot of the Battlecries either.
---
how the fuck is this upvoted when Battlecry Shudder shaman is literally a t2 deck in wild lmfao.
---
Bobs friendly voice will also keep me welcome more frequently again. :)
---
The solution is easy. Just nerf 2/1 rush minions to 0/1 rush minions. Then it is probably gonna be balanced.
---
Night howler
---
This is where your wrong! You see Dean Iksar Ayala did say during playtesting the 6 mana 2/2 for Warlock was overtuned and need -1/-1. Doesn’t that make it all better 🤓
---
‘Tis the joke
---
I mean if you see an opponent of a certain class use a card with the Invoke battlecry, you will need a steering wheel to bottom-right the fuck out of there.
---
Then you haven't seen me yet. All hail Shirvallah OTK
---
Id like to disagree on something. While yes, it builds itself as a winning deck and it plays itself into a winning position, the archetype has an extremely large pool of cards to choose from and the way you play your midgame can definitely edge you from 60% to 70-80% winrate. 
---
That said, I do agree that other decks should get closer, but I think that mainly has to do with the fact a majority of the less skilled players will leave 'bad decks' and the good players will find ways to pilot the likes of tempo rogue and other skill-oriented archetypes through these bad shaman players. But a good shaman player will probably be very hard to beat in any case.
---
Pirate warrior is the best aggro deck probably so if you want to climb that's the way to go.
---
Yeah he's a great dude, but hearthstone still had flaws even when he was at the reigns. I'd love to have a beer with him though.
---
If by ASAP, you mean three months from now, you are correct.
---
They really didnt test it out.
---
It didnt have to be a battlecry.  It should have been a 5 mana spell and no body.  The fact on turn 7, as you said.. they have full charged Galakrond in one turn, easily.. AND get 11/7 stats, 4 with rush.. just shows that they didnt think about that minion.
---
It should either be 3/3/4 invoke once.. or 7mana to make up foe the HUGE gains it gives.
---

---
Still 100% against Shamans with my Handlock :) I keep playing it until the first nerf
---
A gaff he
---
My guess for a nerf is to remove rush from all th me galakrond tokens. That should hurt the survivability of the deck against aggro by a lot.
---
haha because not other class playing toggwaggle except druid right? 
---
damn i was confused too.
---
OHHHHHHHHHH THATS RIGHT
---
i got really REALLY salty after getting beat by the 10th galakrond shaman, then someone said that galakrond warlock was a good counter... i tried egg warlock, been beating those bastards now.
---
Whizbang's choice for priest is res priest with no cards from current expansion.
---
You think you want to play another classes, but you don't.
---
I just realized lmao
---
OP, can be combo'd with Mojomaster Zihi.
---
xd
---
The battlegrounds will randomly drop from 10 seconds left to 0 seconds left with no in between. On iOS. Never happened before the expansion, but it happened 3 times for me yesterday
---
What mirror tech? AoE?
---
lol
---
"How to make sure players use our new cards ?"
---
"IDK just give them rush so they always impact the board."
---
Yeah I'm normally fairly "there's always going to be a deck people complain about", but I've barely played since the expansion launched this time.
---
It's just not fun.
---
Changing the hero power of gala to add an 1 mana 2/1 elemental with rush to your hand instead of summoning it, would change a lot. Shaman will no longer have board advantage for the time he summon the wolves or gala itself.
---
Im with you and all what you said is correct exept one point. I have a lot of fun playing against Shamans, because I got 100% WR with Handlock. Handlock is working pretty well atm against him.
---
According to one of the top posts this morning from HSReplay, Galakrond Quest Shaman is &gt;62% winrate and its worst matchup is...wait for it...the Galakrond Quest Shaman mirror at 50% winrate.
---
I thought this was referring to that one tavern brawl they had during the doom in the tomb, completely forgot it was talking about the solo adventure though, I never bought the 2nd wing so I just forgot about it really quick
---
But you can still upgrade the one you have in hand
---
How long until that one YouTuber that is always on Blizzard's dick makes a "How to Beat Shaman (if it's even possible)" video that they put on the Battle.net Launcher?
---
yes.
---
I actually have a decent win rate vs shaman, but only when playing galaktond priest to galakrond his galakrond.
---
I hope you "love" playing against shaman 9 times in a row, because that was my experience last night.
---
Elementalist would be a strong card even if the battlecry was just "summon two /1 with rush". The Galakrond synergy make go from pushed to what were they thinking ?!
---
Lol. No. Rank 15 - 14 now testing decks for fun. 20 games, 11 Shamans.
---
If I remember correctly though, 4 mana 7/7 was not played in that aggro Shaman.
---
Usually they are stronger early on and are annoying for the firs lt week
---
I've been playing since classic.  
---
There's always strong decks people dislike, but theres *never* a deck that has a positive winrate against every single deck. That's just overpowered and boring.
---
*goes to battleground* sees 5 players playing murlocs.. okay time to play other game.
---
Rush, so you can play a card, and instantly get board control!
---
Me: awwwwe who is a good boy
---
Galakrond: really?
---
Me: yeah sorry...
---
Galakrond: Wait i'm a good boy!
---
Non quest version crushes the quest version in the mirror.
---
just play wild lol
---
invoking activates the hero power, not the battlecry
---
It’s been like 2 days you whiners. A fix will come when it comes
---
Y’all sound like those children who say “you don’t care about me...” when a parent doesn’t buy them that expensive toy in the store window.
---
With an incredible 50% matchup, the best counter is a new deck called "Galakrond Shaman". It also has good matchups against the rest of the field!
---
Idk if it’s just luck but I’ve been playing with my control mech warrior from SOE-Uldum since I haven’t been able to afford a new deck since bc F2P and absolutely stomping them, usually I can go into fatigue and far outlast them/ clear anything they play quite easily.
---
&gt;Been there done that and it’s BS. Too many try hards using battlecry shaman in ranked
---
... How can one be a "try hard" in ranked mode?  Play casual.
---
If you want to fully experiment within a class, you honestly need to narrow that down to 1-2 classes and pray that they don't become irrelevant whenever a new expansion drops.
---
galakrond shaman is a counter to quest galakrond shaman
---
Fuck Dalaran.
---
Same for me. Handlock is really, really good against Shaman.
---
Ive been enjoying holy wrath paladin this expansion so far
---
No he’s also suggesting without Elise. He said it has enough threats to kill control Warrior without an end phase package.
---
It ain’t free If it’s hitting a minion.
---
Cw was a counter to shaman during doom in the tomb as well. For most people though, it was easier to complain on reddit than to learn to play something that isnt agro.
---
Well really the only way to get cards is to buy packs and maybe disenchant cards you don't need, but I wouldn't recommend that since as a new player you don't really know what you might need in the future. I'd suggest only disenchanting duplicates and goldens for now. You can buy 10 packs of each expansion to get a guaranteed legendary, but I wouldn't recommend buying anything after the rise of shadows because these sets will rotate out of standard in April. You can also buy one whispers of old gods pack to get a free legendary that you can disenchant for 400 dust. Don't expect to craft a tier 1 deck in the beginning (if you're f2p) and you don't really need to, at this rank your opponents aren't going to have one either. There will also be a solo adventure in January I think which will give you 35 new cards, but these adventures cost 700 gold per wing (there should be 4 wings) or about 20 bucks for the whole adventure, so start saving up if you want to play.
---
 7 mana win the game
---
The title?
---
Do you need a hug?
---
There is coming one with a new bundle its called hazelbark i think
---
https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23239988/es-ist-wieder-zeit-furs-winterhauchfest
---
You’re doing gods work son
---
So annoying to manually go through every card though, so much easier to just mass disenchant lol
---
Its not relevant usually, but windfury is thematic for shaman and elementals.
---
Point is 1/1 windfury is still far worse than a 2/1 but not strictly worse than 2 1/1s that Warlock gets
---
What about that 9/9 rush for 5 mana or something like that?  
---
I feel cheated, paladin isn't unfair enought to thrive in this stupid new meta.
---
Well, r/fuckshaman is not so popular as r/fuckdruid yet.
---
This is a joke right?
---
Kinda surprised something is beating secret HL Pally's winrate during last expac/event.
---
or maybe you're just the best player in the world? has to be one of those two options right..
---
Losing fits Priest's ClAsS iDeNtItY
---
You missed the point. If you take a very simplified board state where I have X and you have Y, I can play Z, have my X trade into your Y, have my non-rush, non-charge Z then become my X for next turn, and then on your turn play Y and the cycle repeats with 0 face damage.
---
Now with so much good rush, I have X and play Z, except my Z rushes into and trades for your Y letting me face with X. Having a board and playing rush minions is almost as good as having access to charge.
---
Rush was intended as a way for the person who's behind to be able to fight back for the board but has become the very tool the player who's ahead uses to stay ahead. Before, if you were behind, you could at least put out some fat taunts to possibly come back in 2 turns, not any more.
---
Something Magic has that people complain about sometimes, that helps the issue a bit, is that Aggro decks naturally run less sources of mana. A refill card like Underbelly wouldn’t work in Magic because the aggro player would have to spend an entire turn, even late-game, playing it and maybe one other Murloc to trigger it once. It also means that aggro won’t always draw a creature/minion each turn in Magic; they will occasionally dead draw a land, giving a little bit of breathing room where Aggro can’t develop new options for a turn outside of what they had left in hand (if anything). Control draws more lands for turn than Aggro does, but they also run more cards that draw cards and more cards that use that mana. 
---
Aggro, in Hearthstone, also gets helped by being favored by the aggressor in combat. But that’s just a matter of scale; the big problem is that aggro can play 5-mana worth of cards just as easily as Control can, so when Aggro gets a 2-drop that lets them spend 10 mana to refill the board late-game, that becomes pretty good. Magic has mana sink cards, too, but they aren’t playable in Aggro; they’re played in Midrange and Control.
---
Have you actually play with the card or the deck generally?
---
Yeah exactly, these decks complete themselves. I remember Shudderwock Shaman being 'broken' on day one. If you look at that deck now it was the most janky unrefined bullshit, but won because it was the most OP combo that had been figured out on day 1 and everyone else were playing bad decks.
---
As other decks become refined, it stands to reason shaman will also become more refined. Just look at how some have moved away from running quest because, oh who knew, Galakrond package alone is just so OP that quest was actually holding IT back.
---
Shaman WAS the brutal alpha predator in the purify meta, boasting stretches of time where the only 50% or worse match for Shaman was Shaman. The mirror, and the other Shaman deck.
---
4 4/4’s are really bad compared to 4 8/8’s. I don’t think they should focus galakrond but how fast galakrond can get up to that point. The 5 mana 3/3 invoke twice is insanely strong. If they have battlecry hero power and do just this one card they already have a board full of 8/8 next turn. It should be 6-7 mana. And everything slows down in pace.
---
It doesn't matter. Even if shaman gets nerfed these same people will just latch onto the next strongest deck. They're never happy and will always complain about something.
---
Maybe people don't have the dust to try a million new decks so they play with the cards they have?
---
Shaman has never left popularity with blizzard and I’ve been playing since beta, they suck Shaman off every single fucking expansion. It’s never not a threat.
---
You're right that gyro is strictly better. The fact *is* harpy was bad. Harpy being bad is what makes this strictly *not* powercreep.
---
Yes, I am super salty :(
---
It's how OP this entire set is, they can't nerf eveything, we're stuck with it.
---
It is a good point.  Where is even their identity anymore? They don't do anything with totems.  Their hero power has needed changing for a long time though, the randomness just makes things always rng dependent unlike other classes.
---
This was never more obvious then the Tunnel Trogg meta. 
---
This is all a side note to the current problem of course.
---
It's like people cant be bothered to know what a word means if they can use it as a buzzword to farm upvotes.
---
It’s like pre-nerf Dr Boom.
---
Do you happen to know if it is a bug where certain animation will cause the game to lag? There are certain animations like shudderwock, or even flame strike sometimes causes the game to go to lag and the only solution I've found is to log out and then log back in.
---
See, you and I are the lucky ones. We can experiment without any fear or punishment. Imagine being at 6 and constantly facing against a Shaman, stopping you from reaching 5 every time.
---
Galakrondception
---
The strongest Shaman deck atm doesn't even play it, so it's not really the main offender.
---
I wish i had 2 golden. I love thief rogue.
---
This is big brain time!
---
You had a golden monkey
---
Yea you’re going to want to start actually playing the card game. Gold is only used for buying solo adventures and packs and during events you can get quests that give you multiple packs. Good luck being F2P😂
---
64k played games is "too early" when most decks mid-meta are considered conclusive evidence at 1-5k played games. lmao..
---
Oh c'mon, Pirate Warrior completely sucked.
---
If you read the comment above you will see that I dont think mogu needs a nerf  it is just the fact that it combos with the invokes and helps  him survive early game
---
Odds are you should go outside.
---
Shoulda kept the token cat, now he gets 2 coins :P
---
Fox
---
Haha, actually giggled:)
---
it's just the perfect storm: shaman has arguably the strongest hero power to invoke, the invoke cards are easily the strongest (only one with invoke twice) and shaman galakrond has the best battlecry I'd argue as well
---
Netdecking has been here for a long time now and there have been good and bad metas throughout the years. Netdecking has very little impact on a meta. If you really dislike netdecking you can always hang at Rank 20, Solo Adventures and Arena.
---
With all the rush it's pretty good
---
It doesn't matter if you beat it once. Any deck can beat shaman. It's understanding that nothing is beating shaman consistently
---
Nobody gonna mention that Rogue actually is 0.5% better, even though the win rate still sucks?
---
Shamestone
---
it's telling you to kill yourself 
---
Unironically
---
The solution is simple. Remove Thrall from the game
---
Didn’t bonemare get nerfed to 8 mana as well?
---
Woah, you have some really cool deck names
---
Hmmm....
---
She has no special interaction with arthas??
---
I came here to say the same thing. Patron Warrior, Aggro Hunter, Voidlord Warlock...I could go on. There is always some PITA deck that people complain about.
---
"Some of the most engaging metas in games (not just Hearthstone) are where there is a clear choice for the best deck."
---
\- Galakrond, the game designer
---
Look Chakki's real busy with Battlegrounds, gotta play it on live a lot to keep that top 100 leaderboard spot. Better to leave testing Shaman decks to the intern who wanted an easy legend after release.
---
You're assuming 5 pros would achieve the kind of balance blizzard wants.
---
But, they're not making the game for pros. The tournaments are basically just big ads for hearthstone. They're making the game to sell packs to the widest possible audience, and if you balance the game entirely around top-tier play you alienate a lot of your audience.
---
The design decisions are not baffling when you realize that they're trying to strike a middle ground between competitive balance and shiny/exciting/easily accessible content to get new players hooked. And, considering that the game dies without new blood, it's not such a bad thing. Usually.
---
With aggro, either you win in 5 turns or you basically lose. So it's very easy to climb ranks with aggro as apposed to playing a 10-20 minute tempo/ control game. In tournaments though, a lot of these professionals expect the aggro and make sure they can play around it. A good control deck can win against a lot of aggro decks if you draw your board clears early enough. 
---
Aggro is a lot more straight forward and simple, so inexperienced players may find it easier to win games like that as opposed to control where you have to think many turns ahead in order to play the deck correctly
---
Yes, already hate the meta, I think I deinstall the game.
---
Bummer dude, you're missing out on a really great addition to the game! You should give it a try it is wonderful variety for HS fans and FAR BETTER than these trash single player 'experiences' they have been forcing down our throats...
---
The guy who summons 3/3’s?
---
Maybe use your brain and come up with a deck that beats the so caLLED Deck or at least go poitive int erms of winrate.
---
Holy Wrath is the only deck that goes even with it according to the HSReplay stats.
---
Its actually quite good. These 1/1 Lynx were most likely all (but one) in OPs deck. Getting rid of them allows you to draw cards that you actually want instead.
---
I play HS mostly on my phone (galaxy s9) and since the recent patch I have encountered MANY issues, in the collection my hero portrate is a greensceren, one if my decks is invalid despite being 30 cards and full standard, emote chat bubble not displaying, card overlay issues. And the store is broken.
---
Thank you, I was about to dust every Shaman card I currently have. Had it not been for this warning I would have surely died
---
I love watching hearthstone while looking through a bottle of vaseline while shaking from my alcoholism
---
&gt;I didn't miss people netdecking
---
Card games simply aren't for you if netdecking is something that bothers you.
---
Also same with Hunter legendary dragon
---
I have given it a try lol, some people just dont like it. And what do you mean better than “single player” experiences? Both BG and constructed are multiplayer lol
---
This is the list from IamThanh I used. I just changed some cards. 
---
https://twitter.com/iamthanh_hs/status/1204539055863672832
---
I dont use Siamat and neither the hellfire (because of two nethers drakes + nether breath)
---
I play 2 Rotten instead
---
Suboptimal tempo plays. 2/1 rush. Thinking.
---
Priest never gets a moment to shine unless it's some degenerate strategy in wild. I don't get why they're so scared of giving Priest good sets but continue to baby Rogue every expansion.
---
It’s literally the second day of the expansion. Of course brain dead aggro counters slow greedy decks that people experiment with.
---
Meanwhile, I’m over here with my rogue waxedred/ undertaker/recurring villain, toggwaggle, galakrond deck.  My opponent can’t figure out what I’m doing if I don’t know what I’m doing.
---
Blizzard designs cards a few expansions in advance.
---
So, if a class is bad in Rastakhans, they give it good cards in RoS, SoU, DoD.
---
Maybe it becomes good just off the cards in RoS. The SoU, DoD cards are already developed. So the good class continues to get good cards.
---
I get that a lot of people like BG, but you should recognize it's not for everyone. Standard hasn't been much fun lately, but I have exactly zero interest in playing BG at all. It's boring as hell. It's more like slots than poker.

---
In meant in the deck you create.
---
?
---
Most of the people who play the game dust the extra cards that they have. In this case this is not worth it and it’s just a friendly reminder. No need to come here with your bad sarcasm
---
Not what he meant, it's about copying cards in hand with [Hunting Party]
---
I believe in him!
---
Pirate warrior has been working fine against shaman for me. They don’t have many responses to quick and easy board state
---
Telling someone to use their brain in a comment littered with typos is a bold move
---
Winrate isn't the issue, it's the monotony. Battlecry Galakrond Shaman is just not fun to play against, win or lose.
---
Wow literally jist pulling stuff out of your ass.
---
The best deck always goes down in winrate. Look at bomb warrior. After awhile people stop playing garbage.
---
And the winrate of druid during KOFT was over 55%.
---
And yea I guess back in the day you could build a super aggro counter. But really most decks had 4 cards max that dealt with cards that early. Basically it was a game of have frostbolt or concede.
---
I didnt spend a cent but still feel shafted with my 81 packs
---
Shaman is and will keep being my favorite class, ever since I started in frozen throne. (got shaman death knight)
---
The rgn and thrash meme decks that could win one game out of ten were so fun. But when the meme got too real with witchwood and shudderwock, It started feeling dirty.
---
I'm still playing shaman.
---
I'm not giving up my favorite class because it's too busted.
---
Instead I think i'll start conceding when I get lethal against something else than a shaman.
---
I don't want to break other people's dreams.
---
Evolve Shaman actually lost against Control Warrior and a handful of other decks. Galakrond Shaman doesn't lose against anything.
---
I had this as well, but the with the word rush. No idea what caused it.
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
It's not just the counter, it's also just a matter of deck refinement.
---
Galakrond shaman is a straightforward list to build and its cheap. Other decks will get better.
---
Shaman is still too good but I doubt it'll maintain 50%+ against everything once all the other more difficult/expensive decks get refined.
---
*Laughs in Nefarian*
---
I played control warrior, as long you can save 2 brawls in hand.. you have a higher chance of winning.
---
But that being said, every class should have a chance to win against it. Otherwise is just bad design and gameplay
---
yeah this card is legit singlehandedly ruining the game right now lmao
---
it's so dummy busted, feels bad to have this in hand and then your opponent coins one out themselves, clearing your board, now you lose cuz you can't do it back to them
---
it feels almost like playing against wild sniplock where you can't leave any minions up or you just fuckin lose when they buff the shit out of it
---
Zephrys also doesn't recognize that \[\[Waxadred\]\] is a deathrattle. It never offers \[\[Polymorph\]\] or \[\[Hex\]\].
---
What about DMH? Where can I go read up the specific interactions of copying and shuffling?
---
I mean thematically it makes sense with the hero power but it's simply too much.  Priest battlecry is kill minions, warrior draw and buff, rogue draw and reduce and warlock is random demons.  The battlecry doesn't have to be perfectly in line with the hero power.
---
Taking away the rush would have been fine.  I mean 6/6s with rush would have been fine I think 6/6 with rush is probably still stronger than 8/8s without simply due to that immediate board impact.

It's like Karazhan all over again. Shaman was already too strong, then they released Mana Claws and Maelstorm Poral.
---
Yes but it would mean no guaranteed boardclear as in late game the opponent probably has a fairly strong board. Its a hell of a lot less damaging than 4 8/8 minions
---
No. Hysteria tested it.
---
You mean the doom in the tomb event where they ignored the cries of the player base to remove one card that was ruining the whole event? Team 5 has failed for a few expansions in a row now and the pathetic cash grab release cycle is falling on fewer and fewer ears as trust has eroded and fun alternative strat games have risen up like TFT. I have zero faith in their ability to respond quickly with nerfs with any nuance. They are too busy right now trying to read the future and figure out if two expansions from now they are fucking the game up because that dumb design philosophy has worked well for them so far in balancing the classes.
---
I winstreaked from 9 to 4 with tree druid. Midrange decks prey on gasding-out-too-fadt unrefined aggro or too slow / greedy control.
---
Nah, Dragon-Highlander-Galakrond priest is where it's at
---
Get some albatross in there and you got a deck going.
---
idk how I'm the only one who lost interest in that game mode after like 10 games but I did
---
feels like a tavern brawl except less fun to me lol
---
Its called hate watching
---
The deck is good just not as good people claim it is. I still think that the win rate is simply because people are trying new stuff. I just went 6-0 with otk paladin against shaman I imagine other good control decks can do the same
---
That sounds horrifying.
---
Why silence when you can yoink it?
---
They could do dust refunds based on how they refund HoF rotations. 
---
No refunds at all is pretty shitty if you're f2p
---
That’s all they know how to design so who am I to argue
---
I picked up Zalae's list and just win all my games not even thinkng about my plays. It's no even fun.
---
I don't want to craft any card or try any other deck, because I don't want to be fighting shaman wth it.
---
Valid concern but your proposed change is bad. Quest is play overload minion but reward is double battlecry? What’s the link? Makes no sense. So why overload? Why not play 6 deathrattle reward double battlecry. 
---
You can probably balance the card more by tweaking the number or wording. Like increasing from 6 to 8 or 10 if you want to really nerf the card. Or play a battlecry minion each turn for 6 turns so you only have access to your upgraded hero power at turn 8-9 which is more balanced than having it on turn 4-5 just by spamming 1 mana lackeys.
---
They did nerf Shaman earlier. Take a look at the Invoke payoff cards, without the payoff. 4 mana 5/4, 3 mana 3/2 rush, 4 mana 3/6, 3 mana 3/3.... 5 mana 2 2/3s?
---
I’d be very surprised if Dragon’s Pack did not cost 4 earlier in the design process.
---
"And collecting data."
---
yeah, I've been playing this deck and its wicked..so crazy how imbalanced cards make for such OP decks in any class..
---
Tbh, has worked pretty good so far. I made a recent change where I removed Archbishop cause every priest had some way to copy or steal it so I'm hoping the win rate goes up now
---
vs Shaman every other game? How are you getting that lucky?
---

---
Priest, for me
---
Theyve said it before they dont play the current meta just design op cards and throw em in
---
Everyone should just use Shaman in hopes of making their stat usage tracking machine blow up or something.
---
Not lurking. I love the concept of the game, have been playing since Naxx, and have just as much a right to an opinion on this as you do.
---
“One day I’ll be just like you!”
---
It's the launcher for Battlegrounds.
---
The thing he's talking about it is that you SAY that you'll show you games where the choices matter and aren't polarizing but you've done anything but that.
---
Yeah, happened to me now. Got him to +600 something and suddenly the game ended in a tie. No pack ofc...
---
A big fat zero, because I have no idea how to get past all the taunt minions.
---
The greatest failure of this expansion is no one is playing any dragon packages.
---
Unlucky man.
---
I'm just happy Priest isn't the worst class at the moment. *Wipes away a tear.* Finally.
---
We aren’t far from that already!
---
Guess it's back to Battlegrounds where the game makes sense to me.
---
Remember when they insisted putting Evolve into Standard hadn’t broken Shaman?  It’s because they knew this was coming and didn’t want it to affect presales.
---
the difference is negligible: when designing a card it's pretty easy to tell if it's a strong card or a weak card and the number of times it feels like people are given free reign to make obscene cards is crazy.
---
 like if it's a low key broken card that surprises everyone then fine, but don't tell me cards like Shudderwock "surprised" anyone
---
You forgot the 5/2 weapon
---
Any chance of a list?
---
I love playing control warrior.
---
And yet the card on the left would be better if Elementals existed in Standard because the Dragon tag is such a huge liability with Dragonmaw Poacher. 
---
I honestly think Dragonmaw Poacher probably contributes to a fair part of why the meta is fucked. Galakrond Shaman can just tech in a Dragonmaw Poacher or two if you ever try to hard counter it with a Dragon deck. The best decks right now run very few dragons.
---
"LeT tHe MeTa SeTtLe OuT".
---
Doesn't get buffed by Cauldron Elemental and dies to Dragonslayer --&gt; unplayable.
---
Yeah, they should print combo cards for shaman.
---

---
I've been having fun with Highlander Dragon Shudderwock decks. It could slot in there if you have the cards for it.
---
Seriously, its day 3, people thinking there NEEDS to be a nerf immediately are delusional, doubly so if they think it's going to happen within 2 weeks. Obviously shaman is strong, nobody is arguing with that, but people need time to experiment with the new cards to find a good counter if one exists.
---
If after two weeks there's still no deck that consistently beats shaman then it will warrant a nerf, but right now it's stupid and hasty to cry for one
---
Try opening up a golden one
---
FeelsBadMan
---
I am on a winning streak actually, 6 wins in last 10 games. not too bad. last 4 all won.
---
Or don't give the tokens rush, which would allow the opponent to interact with the board.
---
Or change the tokens to 1/2 rush, preventing the overly favorable trades.
---
No.
---
Thanks for swift reply
---
well if you want to make money, you need people to play your game. if the game is very unbalanced for long periods of time, people stop playing and therefor stop paying.
---
Why the fuck did they make invoke a Battlecry anyways.
---
The game tells me this deck is not valid, anyone else with the same problem?
---
You got the card back. I already got it years ago so I got a pack.
---
As a priest player, I also hate that combo and am upset that it overshadows anything else that priest tries to do
---
You had to use the hero power because he have auto cast
---
You need enough dust to craft it then you can read it, strange if it’s intentional
---
No problem.
---
What about people playing that broken crap that are having fun with it? It’s not fair to ruins people’s fun....
---
it's a shame for druid, was glad to finally get away from all the BS druid decks and get back to Ramp Druid but the deck just can't handle the aggro
---
Wow, didn't know about this.
---
Sweet cause I also got it golden! Golden shower brothers!
---
holy fuck, better buy more packs!!!!!
---
Could you say....they are corrupting the waters?
---
Yes, but when i attacked him his health raise to how much i dealt to him
---
Junkbot is still tier 5, though.
---
Then you are lucky, Shaman can easily beat Highlander Mage.
---
Give it a couple weeks. 
---
Let's be real, we're in the first few days of the meta. 
---
Yes, Galakrond Shaman is insanely strong (you can look in my comments to find just how stupid I think the deck is). But recently, I've found a few decks that just hard counter it: Galakrond Control Priest and Control Warrior. I'd suspect that Handlock wouldn't be a bad option either.
---
&gt;Aggro ~~doesn't care~~ **cares less** about damaging own face
---
Let's be real here, sometimes you're versing another aggro deck and due to deck composition or the way draws worked out, [you're assuming the control role while your opponent is playing beatdown](https://articles.starcitygames.com/premium/whos-the-beatdown/). 
---
In a vacuum Warrior's Invoke may have higher numbers, but in reality you'll sometimes have situations where there's nothing to attack, or where you're racing and your life total is very precious. 2/1 rushers also synergise with cards like Mogu Fleshshaper or Faceless Corruptor.
---
Aside from that, Shaman's Invoke cards are just better. Warrior's invoke cards are both situational and require specific boards from your opponent to be worth playing, whereas Shaman's invoke cards are both undercosted minions. This means you can plop Shaman's Invoke cards down whenever, but won't always want to play Warrior's Invoke cards, even if that means floating mana.
---
Even if Warrior's Invoke effect was better in a vacuum, the cards are simply worse by themselves.
---
the only way I've been winning games is just trading 1 card for 2 whenever possible since the shaman deck will go into fatigue way before you will and although the galkarond push is scary, they lose the double battlecry hero power which means if you can save the brawl you're golden.
---
out of the newer cards I've been testing galakrond with the dragon/barista combo and the whirlwind invoker but the other invoke cards don't really do much for the deck. whirl+the board execute is great though
---
Okay
---
As a spike player myself I always love charge and I personally would rather have it over Rush to help me enable degenerate combos. That being said I can admit for the overall health of the game that Rush is better and it has an important place in the game but it absolutely has been way overdone in terms of how powerful Rush minions are.
---
Shaman is now the obvious example of rush to the extreme but even before that things like dr. Boom just made Rush way too strong. Cards like unleash the beast and swarm of locusts are what rush should be about. Costly but useful. Rush shouldn't be just used for tempo or else it will be used much more strongly by the aggressor than the defender.
---
It is fair to compare it to other video games, because it’s also a video game. And i am very much the kind of person who very frequently defends blizzards pricing in hs. You’re not wrong in that compared to magic or yu gi oh it is very cheap. But compared to like other video games it is expensive. One could just as easily say “you can’t compare Magic’s prices to hs, magic is a physical tgc and hs is a video game ccg, that’s not fair”.
---
That's because it's Floop, not a dragon. Same happens for Zerus, he's considered Zerus until he's played
---
In Standard, we were talking about Wild.
---
It's good not be rushed
---
Rummaging Kobold is hot garbage in any pirate warrior, if you see one plying that you should be glad.
---
Well boys, we did it. 2/1 with rush is no more
---
Do you have mass rez in build? The thing I've noticed when playing shaman is that you need lethal after shudder. That's usually not hard by going face with the weapon since it's hard to deal with but I feel like a priest that can last until shudder could potentially just win by running double plague.
---
How long before this gets nerfed? Probably about 3 weeks after I finish crafting it.
---
face=/=aggro
---
Out jerked yet again.
---
Who is “we”? The post was about standard. So we were talking about standard and you were talking about wild.
---
Maybe just delete shaman?
---
I have over 2000 priest wins, and have gotten sick of priest in the last 2 years since divine spirit * inner fire priest has been one of the only competitive priest decks since raza priest.
---
I've played since tgt and they've been consistently bad. I know game development is hard but I can also compare hearthstone's developers to other games and they're not good. How much evidence do you need to see that they don't give a shit? Come on, they're professionals, they should have standards.
---
Unless you don't ever win except to complete quests and never play during special events you should be able to open 80-90 packs per expansion, and 150 euro is the cost to play almost every deck, not more than one. If you save the expansion before and pay 160 euro you almost get a complete set for the expansion.
---
The Deck does need Kronx too and often runs Barista. The problem is most of the deck is carry overs from quest shaman, which was the strongest deck for the last few months already, so all the Spikes out there who were already running last meta's T1 deck got the Galakrond for free and could hop right into another busted deck for cheap.
---
I really think sudderwock needs to be rotated. The deck would be on a more level powerlevel if it didn’t have the hand, board, and life reload it gets from shudderwock. It just feels so bad because there is literally no way to disrupt shudderwock expect from the hunter 6/9 minion.
---
Extremely well thought out comment and right on point. In addition to something obviously needing to change with Galakrond Shaman, something deeper needs to be done inside Blizzard in terms of their data gathering, reevaluation, and rebalancing
---
But it replaces the weapon immediately. Do you don’t get 20 damage. Or am I wrong
---
Honestly I think the old quest shaman without Galakrond is much better against aggro, better against control, and only slightly weaker against midrange.  You don't have to run all the bad invoke cards (2/1's with rush on turn 4/5 are not good) and you don't give up your hero power when you turn into Galakrond.  Yes, getting the highroll of invoking Galakrond early enough to get the double battle cry on his 8/8's is powerful, and feels OP when it happens.  I just don't think its worth all the games where you don't get your invoke cards, or your get your bad invoke cards but draw Galakrond.
---
Ya I feel like I need the ultra flamestrike, atleast 1 freeze, reno, and zephyrs to beat shaman.
---
Good news Shudderwock is rotating next expansion
---
 [https://hsreplay.net/](https://hsreplay.net/)   
---
The problem isn't complaining, its how Shaman has stayed Meta top tier for 2 xpacs in a row, one to a gimmick, and now to the entire new invoke mechanic.  
---
You cannot look at a summon 4 8/8's with rush, and call that fair.
---
Everybody knows that the face is the place SMOrc
---
Why look at objective stats that prove the deck is too powerful when you could just rant about your own anecdotes?
---
If anyone actually believes hearthstone is in a good state they are a delusional fan boy
---
Twitch viewer numbers on avg? Lowest it’s ever been until they finally popped from battlegrounds release. Will only be a temporary pop. Even with the pop it’s not even remotely close to its highs
---
Active users and $$ flow generation? Regressing and down for multiple years and continuing to go lower probably . 
---
Those are all objective hard facts. You can read the sec filings and statements from the acturd vision suits and twitch history stats are available just google search it.

needs to be: attack: 0 health: 30  - untargetable,  Battlecry: For the rest of the game, battlecry minions and cards cost 2 more, but not more than (10)
---
shaman was already on top before the expansion (even without evolve) , and than give them good battlecrys and a hero card on top that support the battlecry/token meta with bloodlust on top what could go wrong?
---
balancing team needs to be fired if they thought that was a good idea
---
This is just sad, I can totally imagine the amount of players new to the game because they heard of a big update quitting due to an overpowered deck.
---
I do run it, but i feel like i'm already losing by the point i can use it well
---
I wouldn't craft it unless you're only short a few cards or the cards you're short are neutral widely played legendaries. It is a pretty fun deck though.
---
Priest S Tier during saviors of Uldum, what exactly are you smoking?
---
I thought about running whirlwind too tbh, but whenever I’d topdeck it lategame I would feel shitty, I can’t say the same thing about warpath for example which id love to topdeck whenever possible. That’s why I just run that :P
---
"An Earth Shattering Play!"
---
A recent opponent would like to be your friend!
---
So you concede every game?  Jk but seriously as someone who’s been trying to experiment with every class (except druid which I’ve never enjoyed) it’s straight up stupid how many people are playing shaman.  The quest was already extremely strong and adding Galakrond and the few new cards the deck uses just makes it even more op and boring to play against.  The fact the 2/1 minions that spawn from invoking him have rush is beyond ridiculous.  I’m not usually one to call for nerfs, even when a deck has been proven crazy strong (eg. I never was up in arms over even pally at its peak) but in this case I absolutely want one to happen, if for no other reason than because it’s not even a week after release and the games already more boring to me than it has been in years because 2/3 of my games are against the exact same shaman deck.  I also think them making Galakrond 7 mana across all classes was a huge mistake since it means they get to double his battlecry.  I can’t imagine it would’ve been that difficult to alter his cost depending on the class and I don’t see how they would’ve missed that dealing with a double Galakrond battlecry on top of all the other craziness that deck can do is almost impossible.
---
The only thing I “disagree” with here is that the fixes are as simple as “hire more / better people”. They hire pros / top players (Chakki). WotC restructured their design and balance team to fight this exact same problem in MTG and it got them a golden era meta for a time, then Eldraine released and there was busted shit that never should have released. Every card game on the planet is trying to solve this problem. 
---
I don’t know enough about Blizz’s inner workings to know if throwing more full time employee bodies at it will fix much. Nor do I care for the idea of a PTR for a card game. But maybe there’s a way to get the same effect. I wonder if Blizz would ever do something like a Brawliseum for a week / weekend before a new set drops where all of the cards are unlocked for everyone to help them generate preliminary data before the set goes live and people start opening / crafting cards. This would give them a kind of pre-launch testing that would let them make tweaks and / or discover bugs before sending it live and getting people invested. Initial card announcements, Brawliseum Week / Weekend, then final patch notes before the set goes live for real. So it’s not a true PTR, but you still get that testing window before anyone is invested.

We are in a new meta man, shaman uses a different set of cards to be oppressive this time
---
What a ridiculous, useless metric your using. Please spare me your day two hearthpwn statistics. I don't consider that garbage gospel like you do.
---
Yeah it can be tedious, If I ever made a card game I'd make enemy priority actions have a 5 second window max, I like the ability to interact on my opponents turn but I hate that my opponent has four turn timers to decide which counters Pell he wants to use. Use it or lose it
---
Double battlecry makes it a strength. And when their cards are so powerful do they even need card draw?
---
It is way too early to say something like that.
---
To be fair I’d argue it’s both easier to balance league(mobas in general rather) and that it also easier to miss things that are outliers in a card game. Not to excuse shamans current state, but changing a champions skill to do 5% less damage is usually gonna be less impactful on the meta than even changing one cards mana cost by 1 can be.
---
Yeap, we out here playing our weak ass janky control decks. Most of the time we lose, but when we high roll some broken shit oh boy does it feel good.
---
I played a aggro/midrange Dragon Paladin. 
---
Somehow it was easier to stay on board and eventually start SMOrcing Galakrond down. (before Shudderwock) Against quest it’s just game over after they activate it. To not be able to have more than 3 minions is just brutal.
---
I copied Galakrond on a priest and still lost.
---
Very well said and put together, thank you for doing this. Myself and MANY others feel this exact same way and I hope they will look into this. 
---
But hey they are just a small indie company so we can't expect them to devote many resources..... /s
---
The freeze is still pretty strong. It’s glacial shard with Rush that upgrades another card.
---
Those would be completely the wrong nerfs.  The highest winrate version doesn't even run the quest, and the second nerf would break the pattern for galakrond upgrades and I doubt it would matter enough.
---
Given how ridiculously prevalent the shaman galakrond is, I would change its hero power to summon a 1/1 instead of a 2/1.  It would be a huge hit, but that seems to be what is needed.  All of the invokes summoning 1/1s would mean you actually take a hit on tempo to get to dragon's pack, and it gives your opponent a chance to actually develop a board before you start playing power cards and overwhelm them.
---
Three blessings on you, mutsera!
---
N'Zoth Priest was strong for the first week and a half, and then it was terrible.
---
Click "context".
---
1. Collect the combo cards: Tog, Muro.
---
2. Empty your deck and get to 8 mana.
---
3. Play Tog.
---
4. Await their Ransom Turn.
---
5. Play Muro, which plays a copy of their ransom.
---
6. Emote until they resign.
---
It was too powerfull because it was a great adition to cubelock, that was a very strong deck at the time.
---
Right now, a year later and no posibility of cubelock, it was created as a minion and as a demon too, so in wild, even if it was used in cubelock, it will fuck up completely its strategy. This way it was also made neutral so that other combos are possible for the players to experiment with, although the main concern was cubelock.
---
they should hotfix it that galakron shamans only que into mirror matches so everyone else can have fun.
---
Dude it’s been two days, there are so few stats that paladin only has one deck up on ha replay right now so please bring me the stats if you’re saying they are that important and maybe I’ll change my mind
---
I got to 1249 w/ near infinite Sylvanas shenanigans once (died to turn limit though)

Been playing HS since day 1. There will always be something we complain about. No matter the meta (99% of the time). This time it's just shaman but if shaman didn't exist this exact post would just be about a different class.

I mean at least it's increasing the priest win rate or something
---
Could someone explain the memes to me? I haven't had a change to open up hearthstone with the new cards yet. What are these cards?
---
Facts
---
I put down HS after the HK shannanagains and honestly don't miss this garbage at all.
---
“acturd”.. haha reminds me of “Acturdvision”
---
I like shitting on Blizz as much as anyone else, but millions upon millions of games are played when these sets go public. There is no way to replicate that in balance testing.
---
Who is the guy on the bottom right?
---
Oh, I'm sorry, I meant **Battlecry: Invoke** minions.
---
I was hoping for a few more reborn cards to be printed so my quest deck might not suck so much.
---
But you know, dragons.
---
Not saying you're wrong, but you also don't have 2 mana to play it
---
I agree. I've been playing a fair bit of Zoo and finding myself getting annihilated by Galakrond Shaman and Cyclone Mage. I build up a board in the early game, but they hit their tempo swing in the midgame and just blow me out from there.
---
When decks can fill a board with rush minions or put a ton of stats in play for a small amount of mana, a traditional board-based strategy can't be successful.
---
i run n'zoth aswell, he is just to big of swign turn to miss.
---
 And being jade deathrattles and sylvannas aswell possible he brings back makes board lot harder to clear(+ with valeera up you can shadow step n'zoth and use copy shadowtsep on aya 
---
so next turn you can can do a double aya turn with valeera the hollow and if they deal with that can do annother n'zoth turn after.
---
Once you get into lategame not many can easly beat you,and for aggro n'zoth brining back 2 or more of the reborn taunts just wins you games never wouldve won otherwise due all healing + 4 or more taunts they have to hit.
---
That said even shaman and burn decks are your worst matchups,even shaman has alot of big threats earlier then you if you can combo some deathrattles to get going and can deal with taunts,deathratltes and n'zoth with devolve(and being devolved they dont get in ress pool either). 
---
Burn decks like secret mage are hard cause unless run healbot you dont have any direct healing aviable,but if you use the matchup is lot easier. But its winnable without still aslong focus on board control so they have to use burn on your minions instead of face,and valeera is best saved to get that extra free turn where they cant hit you due the stealth.
---
And a neat small combo if you shadowcaster on a shadowcaster(valeera or just second copy) you can go infinite with jade spirit,valeera and shadowcaster. jade spirit (4) shadowcaster (1) on it,then shadowcaster the shadowcaster(5) and got endless stream of minions.

But then it would need to be 4 mana, and that's not good enough any more.
---
EU - Modjahed#2518. 80g quest, I show you go first.
---
Except he doesn't even count as a dragon in your hand, which is stupid.
---
Didnt happen, the weapon does 100 self-damage when it expires so after this turn I won.
---
And the worst part is if the deck *does* prove to be too much, they’ll all feel justified in all of the premature whining.
---
Galakrond upgrade can be 2/1 just like tokens, then 4/2, and 8/4. To keep the doubling theme.
---
The last 4 expansions have received 7-12 days after release.
---
Well, it was originally assumed a special boss card for the Lich King fight due to its power at the time.
---
I had him at over 3000 damage before I was smart enough to equip the weapon. He was fatigued and I had a full deck and board of 30/30 jades. I received the reward and was in there quite a while.
---
Honestly, Megasaur should go. It would lead to the rare poisonous Murloc via Toxfin, it would allow for them to grow quite big and be competitive via the earlier buff Murlocs and Bagurgle. Without becoming oppressive by making them all toxic and adding divine shield on top just to add insult to injury.
---
&gt; The valid argument is that there isn't enough data in two days to know that it's a tier 0 deck, it takes time to adjust to what is strong. 
---
If you went for a pure data based concept around win rates and played rates sure.  If you instead used a little bit of perception and looked at the incredibly broken interaction that has been created you'd quickly see you don't need data to realize something needs to be done about it.    
---
The "it's only X days" excuse doesn't hold up for me because for something to put the Shaman deck down it would have to be on a whole other level of broken which is probably worse.    
---
&gt;Yeah, and unpopular kids aren't going to participate in a popularity contest.  
---
Well if you put any weight on the voting system sure but that's just stupid.  It was supposed to be about how relevant a post was to a topic to remove troll type posts from visibility but it quickly got adopted into the facebook "like" system which is a shame.
---
I’m out of the loop but I know a set just recently dropped. What deck/hero is busted currently? Or what’s this about?
---
(I’m going to check out the sub to see in the meantime to see if I can find it, lol).
---
I mean technically this system works great in mobas. But yeah not in a card game
---
I’ve been playing on and off since closed beta and this is the first time that I’m not even playing a release because of the sheer number of Shamans I play against and just how unfun they are to play against. Team 5 has proven time and time again that they have no idea how to properly balance their own game. Maybe they should have focused on balancing this expansion instead of bringing out battlegrounds.
---
I can beat shaman with highlander mage. I just wait for them to fill up the board because they only have minions (or minion based spells) and then I freeze and build my own board to kill them
---
Hahahhaha good one
---
It has felt pretty bad recently, even many of the increasingly few streamers who still play Hearthstone regularly and can usually muster at least a few weeks of grinding the ladders are seemingly struggling stay engaged, even after a couple of days...
---
...And now they have an alternative mode to play with Battlegrounds, so things look pretty dire for the 'main' portion of Hearthstone.
---
Part of me thinks that the team need to take a step back, slow things down, don't print 3 large expansions a year to milk what's left of the playerbase who are willing to drop money on pre-orders, but instead focus on more **frequent**, **cheaper** and **small sets** that can create their own '**Micro-Metas**'.
---
That way, they'll be able to pin down problem cards, quicker and easier, and the game can stay fresh.
---
If that style of release would offer the same amount of revenue though is up for debate.
---
Running this: https://hsreplay.net/decks/56GntMFerGAQWlPzp0iZY/
---
Open to suggestions for replacements
---
Galakrond. Azeroth’s End*
---
I'd have to agree. I don't know why everyone is crying about broken cards.  We knew this expansion was going to be over powered after the first chunk of cards they revealed. 
---
You know what the great thing about broken cards is? You can use them too.
---
Just wait, eventually Shaman will near the 50% again :D  
---
^^^^and ^^^^the ^^^^other ^^^^classes ^^^^will ^^^^near ^^^^0% ^^^^playrate
---
The skill gap between rank 12-5 and 5-legend is huge. People misplay a lot in 12-5. Play in the lower ranks and you will get a bit more annoyed
---
I really had high hopes for Rogue, especially since the invoke gives them flexibility with tempo or value (which is a rare thing to do). But alas, my day 1 crafts dont seem so good now.
---
I think the rant posts are worse. Those should be deleted first. Let’s start with this one.
---
Link doesn’t work for me

any card you change will proably make it better :D
---
So good luck and dont expect much... but its fun \^\^
---
  
---
Btw, Talritha is probably the best card in this deck. If you draw her on 3 your winrate goes up like a Rocket.
---
okay i see, thanks so much for info ! (: appreciate it
---
There were 2 mirrors, so to speak, but they were playing the Quest like noobs.
---
No, since non quest version is arguably stronger.
---
Just make galakrond cost 9. That way shaman can’t double up the 8/8’s

---
Eh, i think thats a bit harsh. The single player content has been great, and Battlegrounds is an outstanding success. The problem is most likely that the team is just way to damn small.
---
I don’t think it’s underwhelming. 4/4 * 4 is still 16/16 stats on the board which should be enough to clear some enemies but not the entire board
---
Wild is Blizzard’s malnourished stepchild chained to a radiator in the basement. They might actually do something about Standard.
---
Glad to see someone is beating them. Mind sharing your deck list friend?
---
You're stating the obvious about all of this - and keep stating it because it's important to keep vocal about it all - but, the common denominator here is the corporation, not Team 5.
---
It's too big, compartmentalized, bureaucratic, etc. to provide the kind of timely service you want.
---
Again, I'm not saying this is a pointless thread at all.  Upvoted.  Gilded you too.  
---
Just saying that we need to turn our ire towards Big Blue more than the guys on Team 5 who are, I assure you, just as frustrated as we are that they do not possess the tools or resources to do things right.
---
LOL
---
Honestly I havent had any insane standouts that I cant fight against. Im playing highlander Hunter and am able to put enough pressure on them to win a lot of the time.
---
I got this as my free legendary and I was super disappointed. Is it actually good then?
---
the usual argument of "we don't like to nerf cards very often because some players spend all their dust to craft them only for the deck to become terrible soon after"
---
Wasn't Chakki hired for his deck building skills, thus, his ability to figure out what might be problematic before releasing it? As mentioned, their play testing team is awful.
---
I find my patience with the imbalance is becoming shorter over time and it's easier for me to just not play and be totally fine with it. It's still early in this expansion but obviously there are trends that suggest things won't really change within the next 6-8 weeks.
---
so this is a screenshot you took about 24 hours ago (judging by the amount of games logged compared to the actual current page https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/346/galakrond-shaman#tab=matchups ) which you're posting now and calling "current"?
---
People wont quit. People never quit. And they know it.
---
The best meta of course
---
The feeling when you clear the board 4 times (equality+pyro x2, shrink + dragon x2) and they still pull out 8/8s out of their asses.
---
The extra arms nerf was dumb
---
Seeing a post of a shaman getting stomped brings a tear of joy in my eye.
---
If control decks try to grind it out shaman will just include the new infinite ahudderwock combo.
---
Outvalue 5 mana double 5/6 taunts, 9 mana quadruple 8/8 rushes, and 5 mana quadruple 2/1 rushes?
---
And extremely stupid.
---
I'm at rank 15 right now. More than half the decks I encounter are Galakrond Shaman. Anything else just can't compete.
---
i thought we might see Elementalist up to 6 mana
---
Yeah, at the start people used to gradually lose health and there would be a gradient from first place to last. The person in first would be relatively healthy, the person in second would be missing a little bit of health, person in third might be at 28 or something. 
---
Now? If you don't get a token minion on turn 1, that's -15 health over the course of the game. Got shitty tavern RNG on turn 3? -10 more health. Bad matchup RNG against the Rafaam who had two triples on turn 4? -9 more health. 
---
The vast majority of games now have everyone getting blasted down to sub-20 health pools where one loss will knock you out, and then there's just that one guy who got the proper murloc build (usually rafaam) who's sitting at like 35hp at the top while the guy in second has 11hp. 
---
Making the mode more aggressive has made it more and more random, and if there's anything Battlegrounds did not need, it's more randomness.
---
so you mean one 4/4 &gt; two 4/4 &gt; four 4/4?
---
That may work...
---
I really think a big part of the hate is from going from dealing with cancerous evolve shaman to this. Too much representation from one class very quickly burns out the players.
---
For your next improvement I recommend setting these to play "Running in the 90s" or the drop in "Brainpower" :D
---
Faceless Corruptor definitely is the biggest problem rn. And tbh I don’t even think galakrond shaman is unbeatable, I’ve been finding counters myself and I know decks will be refined to counter shaman better as the weeks go by. Seems like people are losing their shit over something that happens literally every expansion
---
I mean a specific community, like the reddit community, isnt an accurate representation as people here usually have the same mindset. I remember a while back fortnite had an event that they were bringing back a vaulted weapon. One weapon offered was the drum gun, a gun the entire online community hated. However, it was the winner with 90 percent of votes being for it. You cant just look at something like a post, see how much likes or whatever it has and be like, ok this is what everyone wants
---
On paper (heh) MTGA is cheaper, but with the many events that take in-game currency and/or real money paired with very few cards that overlap in decks Hearthstone probably lets the average player play more unique decks.
---
H+8 is more like when people went to bed and stopped playing. The numbers start creeping back up at H+16, or 8 hours later.
---
Really funny, i loled.
---
Incorrect?
---
Galakrond
---
I don’t really get what your saying here but I what it means is that during invoking the rush minions go from 2/2 -&gt; 3/3 -&gt; 4/4
---
Has nothing to do with dragons.
---
Remember when board control let you dictate trades?
---
Idk how it is in the highest ranks, but I have literally a 100% winrate with Galakrond priest in low rank, VS 90% quest/gala/both Shaman, and 10% casino-esque mage.
---
I'm not exaggerating. I haven't played ranked since FT, and only started playing again when the year of the dragon started, which lasted a week, before another break that was only ended by Battlegrounds.
---
I know it's still early, but I don't see how priest is getting useless cards. Almost everything I opened in 8 packs is in my deck, and I never feel like I'm ever going to lose, even after gala-shudder combos.
---
Casual opinion, but priest can also get cards to see into your opponents hand from invoke.
---
I honestly don’t get the nerf/buff philosophy at all.
---
Ive played Dota 2 for 6 Years and every time a major patch like 7.00 rolls out, you’re gonna have 7.00a one day later with buffs and nerfs.
---
It’s amazing to me that even the smiley face didn’t signal the obvious sarcasm.
---
Just because it doesn't have the Dragon tag doesn't mean it's not a Dragon.
---
i think the galakrond hero power is the problem, being able to just deal with everthing your opponents throws is just not interactive for your opponent nor fair, i would change the rush to a 1/2 for example idk, also corrupt elementalist needs to be or 6 mana
---
Deck code?
---
haha  that is exactly why I was psyched to build this.  I have had a useless golden Anka I opened a while back that I was itching to put to use!
---
I mean, there are weapons with battlecry, so I don't see why hero cards should be different, the problem is that hero cards are not balanced around shudder and corrupt the waters
---
Eh, I'm a bit skeptical about that. You haven't actually played the custom expansion while you have played Descent of Dragons, so of course the DoD balance problems seem more transparent.
---
Still, I do agree that the current state of Hearthstone balance is unacceptably bad.
---
What are does yellow unopened packs you have?
---
That's not a HoF card?
---
Plenty of stuff? Now that’s hyperbole. They have clearly fucked up plenty of things. Repetitively.
---
They are well paid . Don’t act like they are just doing this out of their goodwill. They need to do better. Period. It’s not like they are rookies in this genre. They have plenty of experience. And yet they keep dropping the ball.
---
I actually played priest Galakrond the first night.. But now its unplayable because shammy and pirate warrior
---
we deserve this. https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/e6okmv/thank_you_hearthstone_team/
---
Havent played this month yet, is shaman galakrond that bad?
---
im having a lot if success with face dragon hunter
---
You are thinking of a show pony
---
If the designers catered to every whim of the players, we would have a turbulent pile of shit
---
at rank 4/5
---
(wherever they are)
---
Why do you think the goal of designing new cards is balance?
---
Oh no, people are playing to win! How inconsiderate
---
Haha, go home you're drunk. There are no HoF cards in there. Reckless is from Boomsday,  Cabal is from classic and Matriarch is from Witchwoowd
---
Shaman Galakrond is the most broken deck I've experienced, going back to when I started around KOFT.
---
It's absurd, and spoils the excitement of a new expansion.
---
Maybe because Turn 6 Gronx &gt; Turn 7 Galakrond, they think the Gronx other effect is secondary and the strong one is drawing galakrond
---
Can you share deck code pls? My homebrew deck was good only few hours after release
---
Golden classic packs I am saving from adventures.
---
Why are you being a smug fedora-tipping contrarian on every post I read.
---
The idea is to interfere with repeating it's battlecry, there's several ways to do it. That's just one way.
---
Firebat (one of the most competent combo pally players out there) wasn't beating them consistently enough to call Pally a counter.  Firebat played that deck for money, and he was getting frustrated by shamans by the end of his stream.
---
Funnily enough if Evolve was nerfed like it should have been, then you could justify making Mutate 1 mana.  
---
The nerf that seems most likely is upping the cost to 9 or 10, they could also make it a 3/2 so that it can trade into things as easily and survive.
---
The problem is battlecries are so common, they’re the most basic mechanic in the game. The shaman quest has a very low barrier to entry because you were probably going to play a bunch of battlecries anyway. Compare this to the paladin quest for example where you have to put a bunch of janky reborn minions in your deck to activate it. You were going to play battlecry minions anyway.
---
And there are so many diverse and powerful battlecry options to upgrade or play again.
---
For some reason when I play shaman I always get shaman opponent, but when I play other class I get non shaman...
---
Maybe I just got lucky a few times but I guess it's a good idea. Maybe they rigged the matchmaking to split game in Shamanstone and 8 class Hearthstone... Could be a nice tmp solution.
---
Sorry I dropped the /s
---
I'm gonna tell you right now, they are CONVINCED that they aren't the problem and that this sub is just whiny and can't be taken seriously
---
Because if there's anything someone who is bad at their job will do, it is lie to protect their ego
---
Priest’s power was not noticed as quickly as mage’s so it didn’t have time to dominate
---
Malygos’ cards are upgraded spells 
---
So yes
---
Stonks
---
I think if you just removed the Rush,  and maybe make it a 2/2 instead, that drops the power of the whole deck.
---
I realize that Wild receives a lot less attention, but yesterday I played Envoy of Lazul, correctly picked the Kazakus custom spell from their hand, but did not receive a copy.
---
Just remove the word rush from everything. Faceless Corrupter, Mogu, the 8/8s and the 2/1s. The most oppressive part of Dr Boom was giving mechs rush, yet Shaman basically gets that passive ability from the start of the game.
---
I don’t know why Blizzard decided this expansion that Rush no longer comes with a stat penalty, as it’s an incredibly strong keyword.
---
Wow you sure showed that guy who literally doesn’t care at all lmao
---
If you can double the effect with Electra it's often better, but with only 8/30 cards @ 2 or less cost you've got pretty good odds to pull a 3+ cost card each time, and low-rolling *should* be an exception...at least, over time. Lol.
---
Well, that's sucks and explain why after 11 old god packs i only got 440 dust
---
in arena

---
The version of my deck I'm currently running.
---
Fate weakens need to cost reduce damage spells, malygos, grave rune, and wretched reclaimed. You can probably guess where it goes from there.
---
ok boomer
---
Just play a deck that counters galakrond shaman. It’s not hard. My dragon warrior has a very high winrate against shaman right now. You just need lots of removal
---
Battlegrounds does need serious work still.  But I think it also says a lot about the mode that even with all the major problems it has, it's still really fun.
---
Keep in mind Priests have an inherent 50% win rate in mirror matchups, which in turn boost the average.  So the effective win rate of Priests is actually lower than 37.3%.  Conversely, the effective win rate of shamans is even higher than listed, especially since there are a LOT of Shaman mirror matchups at the moment.
---
It’s really just a standard highlander dragon hunter with a little hero power package in it
---
Buddy I feel you
---
A good nerf is one that reduces impact with the least amount of confusion. So no making a Battlecry that's not a Battlecry isn't a good nerf.
---
This is 4 Michelin Star Chef level pasta
---
Thank you. It wasn,t easy but I showed him.
---
Lol I have won 3 times with pirate warrior
---
Ok
---
everyone too busy wanting blizz to beat the meta for them. good job dude.
---
First of all, I do think they *don't* want to nerf more often, because as it has been said already, this has a cost. New players don't want their decks dumped because of balance changes. 
---
This is, I think, the main issue with the game and the direction Team5 wants to keep.
---
After this, you say they could cooperate with pros in order to playtest better and avoid broken combos and stuff. I do think they don't want HS to be a pro envy. They like the immediate decks, immediate combos, the strong cards and noob friendly strategies. Don't take this as a snob bs, this is how the game is going in the last YEARS now.
---
I think the best thing to do would be 6 months rotations with more than 3 expansion per year, ofc smaller ones in order to keep track of cards better.
---
There's an inherent tension in card game design: on one hand you want things to be exciting and "ooooh I wonder if I could create something broken by combining x with y" and you want things to be open-ended enough so that decks don't build themselves.
---
On the other hand you want there to be zero broken decks, because if there is one, your player base is going to find it.
---
While the devs are doing a particularly poor job lately (and are slow to fix their mistakes too), it's still a tricky balance to maintain. Even the esteemed Magic: The Gathering has had its hiccups.
---
Sounds like you will win by going poacher and not dragons.
---
&gt; people would be complaining about something else.
---
Can we stop with this? According to that broken logic they could release a 2-mana 2/3 neutral minion with deathrattle: "Destroy the enemy hero" and it would be fine because if they didn't people would complain about something else.
---
And all *you've* done is do "Babies first logical argument" by asking me to prove something self evident. 
---
I took *your* logic to it's natural conclusion to make you look silly. 
---
Here's some advice from a basic high school level debate team, don't press for evidence from something so self evident. It makes you look childish.
---
Which is what Zalae was playing yesterday lol. He popularizes shaman by getting rank 1 with it and then he switches to a deck designed to beat shaman.
---
Can confirm, I cobbled together a weird Control Warrior and I'm like 80% against Shaman and 20% against everything else. 
---
Though I can't really be sure of my winrate against everything else since the sample size is so small.
---
&gt; That's just one way.
---
Normally I just wow along with them and don’t concede, let them get lethal. Doesn’t work every time but it definitely helps
---
"its pretty skilltesting i myself forget to use the hp before using galakrond" bro u just bad with this deck
---
The quest is NOT the issue. It has NEVER been Tier 1. The problem is literally \[\[Dragon's Pack\]\], \[\[Corrupt Elementalist\]\], and the fully upgraded Galakrond battlecry. WAY too many stats, WAY too easy to activate, not even Priest has enough board wipes to deal with that level of BS.

Does anyone know if I can still get rewards from solo adventure Rise of Shadows and Uldum runs? Curious if getting all the wings is worth it now that DoD is released. I was away for about a year, left shortly into boomsday expansion
---
Sure it can. 
---
What, do you think they're intentionally sabotaging their game for the lolz?
---
“I want you (dead), and you and you!”
---
Now I regret not playing the first night. Though I doubt I have the dust to craft either of the decks I want to play.
---
They must have changed it silently because when I bought the wild bundle a few months back (8 packs of every wild non-adventure set), I got my guaranteed legendaries in every set
---
Seriously dude you asking that ? because they want to make money the game industry is big these days they are a company that wants to make money I honestly think every desicion they make lands on the controling team or marketing team call it whatever you want I mean those guys who have to predict how they are going to do the most money. I am also pretty sure that even the current steady decrease of players is predicted by some one at blizz
---
So which streamer played shaman first and ruined the expansion this time?
---
If there's any aspect of the game that should not change, its the basic hero powers. Match-ups and formats that revolve around pressing the hero power button suck.
---
Plus, if Priest get's a new hero power, why shouldn't Shaman also? That class' hero power is atrocious. All the totems should be give an extra health point.
---
Additionally, a hero power being poor has never really stopped a class from being playable. Warrior has been the source of some strong aggressive decks despite the hero power doing *nothing* to help the deck's game plan.
---
U probably got the legendary before and you forgot
---
I always feel pressured by murloc shaman or zoolock, but my list usually doesn't include lightning storm. Either hagathas scheme or earth quake, depending on whether or not reborn minions are becoming more prevalent. What's your secret?
---
That won't do crap to stop the four 8/8s with Rush, you know?
---
I was being sarcastic, Rank 3 is not an accomplishment and your own personal experience is much less relevant than the thousands of players who played the no hands gamer version.
---
Also rank 1 legend IS an accomplishment and that player is far better than you
---
Fake News! Rogue got better top!!11
---
My list works well very often, I often beat them if they can't set up the infinite value combo (play barista). Thanks for the suggestion though, I'll definitely try out deathrattle rogue.
---
I must be doing something wrong as my Shaman Galakrond always on the bottom of my deck and my opening hand is all highest mana cost cards...
---
or maybe it only works on the expansions released since that update. would surprice me with hearthstones spaghetti code.
---
&gt; the drop in Brainpower
---
Yeah, I’d say that’s a fitting song for the current state of the game.
---
To be fair about the corridor creeper thing, not a lot of people thought that card would be broken. We saw a similar mechanic before and it was terrible in paladin. But yeah other than that I agree.
---
It's been really depressing watching streamers try to experiment in the early hours of the expansion and just get dumpstered by shaman after shaman after shaman. Firebat actually said he couldn't really win with any of the new cards unless he was playing Shaman. The only decks that stand a chance are Control Warrior with no new cards, Holy Wrath Paladin with no new cards or Quest Hunter.
---
Oh but while he was playing Quest Hunter he fought against a Quest Hunter with no new cards and conceded that the old version might be better. lol
---
So basically this expansion added one neutral card, Faceless Corrupter, and a few aggro Shaman/Warrior cards. Both decks, conveniently enough, do like 20+ damage to your face with only weapons/lifedrinker so they're extra interactive.
---
Only 8?  Oh ye of little vision!
---
Probably in a week we will have something very close to refined decklist and in two weeks we will certainly have the meta “settled”, I think this has been the usual trend with the expansions BUT I think that the shaman deck is really close to its final form.
---
When your Shudderwock created two copies of himself that you were able to bounce back into your hand on the next turn with barista, I was overcome by a feeling of pride and accomplishment.
---
The low keep rate and high mulligan winrate probably means that Galakrond is only kept if the rest of the hand is strong. If you don't already have good turn 1-3 plays in hand, you'll throw the Galakrond back to look for them.
---
Take easy, Blizzard say they need 2 months to can see it clearly.
---
There is a turn limit.
---
Humans just wants to have their way to the detriment of everything and everyone in, literally, every aspect of life so every time something broken is released a big portion of the playerbase are just going to make the game unplayable or dull for others by abusing the same broken thing just for personal gratification. It's important for the Devs to understand and fix their mistakes but if the majority could understand that the game is being played for fun in Casual and Ranked (no money is involved outside of tournaments so it's still just a game that we play for fun in the end) then they wouldn't be spamming that BS deck all day long...
---
Just curious how the discussion would go, I highly doubt that they took 6 months to nerf snip snap warlock because of the marketing team
---
Faceless Corruptor is broken.
---
Ok thanks, I'm excited to craft but I'm fine with waiting before getting the best version of a deck
---
Jade shaman, quest Murloc, and 2017 evolve shaman weren't even remotely good decks, let alone broken. The problematic shaman archetypes were tunnel trogg/spirit claws, shudderwock combo, and like the last 2 months of evolve and galakrond.
---
When I was trying out this list, the low number of Invoke cards really screwed me over a lot. I know I should be happy using the 2 cvards Galakron most of the time, but it still felt kinda bad when fighting Shamans that get the full one with weapon for basically free.
---
It's a paladin class card, obviously. The scientific name for that species is silverius wingus albatrossum
---
They set a rod for their back with refunding dust. They need to be given freedom to nerf and adjust on a much shorter cycle.
---
No, can confirm op is right. I spent 1100 gold on old god packs and got no legendary
---
&gt;what I want to explore is how this keeps happening
---
It's very simple. It keeps happening because you keep paying. Blizzard knows what a PTR and even use it on other products.. but why bother when you all keep preordering anyway.
---
atleast its cheap.
---
Literally just the same from last meta, it's been a really boring xpac for slow Warriors. I play a highlander dragon Warrior which is fun and not bad at all but I think normal/old control Warrior with the rush/taunt/mech stuff is the way to go.
---
I've been playing since beta and Shaman has been my least favorite class and easily the one I find consistently most annoying the entire time. It wasn't even spectacular or anything at the start, I've just always hated that class and it doesn't help that they always always always get broken ass cards
---
Completed the 2 pack daily quest today for 3 wins. The last guy I played friends me and does the traditional toxic flaming while I'm openning packs.
---
Uldum Pack = Golden Sir Finley
---
Dragons Pack = Ysera Unleashed and Golden Nozdormu
---
Kindly thanked the other person for the karma before he unfriended me :)
---
It's not just an issue with that card being an EVIL Gift. That card also sometimes triggers a restart of a Saviors of Ulduum singleplayer match.
---
Me but with Control Warrior
---
I tried to friend a guy because my UI locked up and I replaced a 7/3 spectral cutlass by accidentally hero powering.  I literally sat there and emoted 'Wow' a couple of times, and he did as well. I wanted to say that I think he had me anyway, but it was a bummer that happened because I had a pretty awesome play.
---
He didn't accept my friend request, which I mostly blame on the terrible people who play this game and their toxic attitudes about other people highrolling.
---
So now, here I sit telling random internet strangers about it instead of sharing that conversation with the internet stranger who was on the ride with me.
---
Depends what you mean with a good choice. Is it good enough to climb to rank 5? Yes. Is it good enough to climb to legend? It depends on how good you are with the deck and how good you know the meta but yes, you can climb to legend with it. Is it fun? This is the more subjective question, for me it’s really fun because I enjoy the more controlish deck and you have powerful finishiers.
---
OTK Paladin is the most boring shit though, really wish Paladin got some good control tools/win conditions so they didn't need to play that crap.
---
I mean it's better than the virtue signaling Hong Kong garbage from a few months ago at least.
---
Right but when you're printing a parasitic mechanic you need to assume people are just going to shove all that shit into a deck as one package, and they will probably try to combine it with the other strong cards that the class has. Half the player base probably unintentionally built the current S tier deck simply by shoving the Galakrond cards into their existing Quest Shaman deck and hitting "play." They absolutely could have found that in play testing, and found that it takes a massive shit on almost anything else.
---
I think if you just changed Faceless Corruptor and Mogu, the deck would feel much more fair. They are the two swings that feel totally broken.
---
I wasnt playing the game at those times and support also confirmed i never opened them before.
---
Idk about fun losing to miracle rogue. It's one of those high roll decks that you either crush or get crushed, and it has nothing to do with either players skill, just the draw order of miracle rogue
---
Okay so there can't be secondary or even tertiary themes? Just because Shaman has 4 standard rush cards and Warrior has 12 rush cards doesn't mean Shaman doesn't have the rush theme, just that Warrior is THE class for rush if that's the playstyle you're looking for. Same thing with hunter and their 7 cards, do they not have rush as a theme just because warrior has more?
---
Also lackeys
---
To follow the other styles of the other cards: 1/1, 2/2, and 4/4  could maybe be plausible especially if we believe it's strong with the battlecry synergies. I actually didn't notice that this is the only outlier.
