“I want you (dead), and you and you!”
---
---
---
Now I regret not playing the first night. Though I doubt I have the dust to craft either of the decks I want to play.
---
They must have changed it silently because when I bought the wild bundle a few months back (8 packs of every wild non-adventure set), I got my guaranteed legendaries in every set
---
Seriously dude you asking that ? because they want to make money the game industry is big these days they are a company that wants to make money I honestly think every desicion they make lands on the controling team or marketing team call it whatever you want I mean those guys who have to predict how they are going to do the most money. I am also pretty sure that even the current steady decrease of players is predicted by some one at blizz
---
So which streamer played shaman first and ruined the expansion this time?
---
If there's any aspect of the game that should not change, its the basic hero powers. Match-ups and formats that revolve around pressing the hero power button suck.
---

---
Plus, if Priest get's a new hero power, why shouldn't Shaman also? That class' hero power is atrocious. All the totems should be give an extra health point.
---
Additionally, a hero power being poor has never really stopped a class from being playable. Warrior has been the source of some strong aggressive decks despite the hero power doing *nothing* to help the deck's game plan.
---
U probably got the legendary before and you forgot
---
I always feel pressured by murloc shaman or zoolock, but my list usually doesn't include lightning storm. Either hagathas scheme or earth quake, depending on whether or not reborn minions are becoming more prevalent. What's your secret?
---
That won't do crap to stop the four 8/8s with Rush, you know?
---
I was being sarcastic, Rank 3 is not an accomplishment and your own personal experience is much less relevant than the thousands of players who played the no hands gamer version.
---
Also rank 1 legend IS an accomplishment and that player is far better than you
---
Fake News! Rogue got better top!!11
---
My list works well very often, I often beat them if they can't set up the infinite value combo (play barista). Thanks for the suggestion though, I'll definitely try out deathrattle rogue.
---
I must be doing something wrong as my Shaman Galakrond always on the bottom of my deck and my opening hand is all highest mana cost cards...
---
or maybe it only works on the expansions released since that update. would surprice me with hearthstones spaghetti code.
---
&gt; the drop in Brainpower
---
Yeah, I’d say that’s a fitting song for the current state of the game.
---
To be fair about the corridor creeper thing, not a lot of people thought that card would be broken. We saw a similar mechanic before and it was terrible in paladin. But yeah other than that I agree.
---
It's been really depressing watching streamers try to experiment in the early hours of the expansion and just get dumpstered by shaman after shaman after shaman. Firebat actually said he couldn't really win with any of the new cards unless he was playing Shaman. The only decks that stand a chance are Control Warrior with no new cards, Holy Wrath Paladin with no new cards or Quest Hunter.
---
Oh but while he was playing Quest Hunter he fought against a Quest Hunter with no new cards and conceded that the old version might be better. lol
---
So basically this expansion added one neutral card, Faceless Corrupter, and a few aggro Shaman/Warrior cards. Both decks, conveniently enough, do like 20+ damage to your face with only weapons/lifedrinker so they're extra interactive.
---
Only 8?  Oh ye of little vision!
---
Probably in a week we will have something very close to refined decklist and in two weeks we will certainly have the meta “settled”, I think this has been the usual trend with the expansions BUT I think that the shaman deck is really close to its final form.

---
When your Shudderwock created two copies of himself that you were able to bounce back into your hand on the next turn with barista, I was overcome by a feeling of pride and accomplishment.
---
The low keep rate and high mulligan winrate probably means that Galakrond is only kept if the rest of the hand is strong. If you don't already have good turn 1-3 plays in hand, you'll throw the Galakrond back to look for them.
---
Take easy, Blizzard say they need 2 months to can see it clearly.
---
There is a turn limit.
---
Humans just wants to have their way to the detriment of everything and everyone in, literally, every aspect of life so every time something broken is released a big portion of the playerbase are just going to make the game unplayable or dull for others by abusing the same broken thing just for personal gratification. It's important for the Devs to understand and fix their mistakes but if the majority could understand that the game is being played for fun in Casual and Ranked (no money is involved outside of tournaments so it's still just a game that we play for fun in the end) then they wouldn't be spamming that BS deck all day long...
---
Just curious how the discussion would go, I highly doubt that they took 6 months to nerf snip snap warlock because of the marketing team
---
Faceless Corruptor is broken.
---
Ok thanks, I'm excited to craft but I'm fine with waiting before getting the best version of a deck
---
Jade shaman, quest Murloc, and 2017 evolve shaman weren't even remotely good decks, let alone broken. The problematic shaman archetypes were tunnel trogg/spirit claws, shudderwock combo, and like the last 2 months of evolve and galakrond.
---
When I was trying out this list, the low number of Invoke cards really screwed me over a lot. I know I should be happy using the 2 cvards Galakron most of the time, but it still felt kinda bad when fighting Shamans that get the full one with weapon for basically free.
---
It's a paladin class card, obviously. The scientific name for that species is silverius wingus albatrossum
---
They set a rod for their back with refunding dust. They need to be given freedom to nerf and adjust on a much shorter cycle.
---
No, can confirm op is right. I spent 1100 gold on old god packs and got no legendary
---
&gt;what I want to explore is how this keeps happening
---
It's very simple. It keeps happening because you keep paying. Blizzard knows what a PTR and even use it on other products.. but why bother when you all keep preordering anyway.
---
atleast its cheap.
---
Literally just the same from last meta, it's been a really boring xpac for slow Warriors. I play a highlander dragon Warrior which is fun and not bad at all but I think normal/old control Warrior with the rush/taunt/mech stuff is the way to go.
---
I've been playing since beta and Shaman has been my least favorite class and easily the one I find consistently most annoying the entire time. It wasn't even spectacular or anything at the start, I've just always hated that class and it doesn't help that they always always always get broken ass cards
---
Completed the 2 pack daily quest today for 3 wins. The last guy I played friends me and does the traditional toxic flaming while I'm openning packs.
---
Uldum Pack = Golden Sir Finley
---
Dragons Pack = Ysera Unleashed and Golden Nozdormu
---
Kindly thanked the other person for the karma before he unfriended me :)
---
It's not just an issue with that card being an EVIL Gift. That card also sometimes triggers a restart of a Saviors of Ulduum singleplayer match.
---
Me but with Control Warrior
---
I tried to friend a guy because my UI locked up and I replaced a 7/3 spectral cutlass by accidentally hero powering.  I literally sat there and emoted 'Wow' a couple of times, and he did as well. I wanted to say that I think he had me anyway, but it was a bummer that happened because I had a pretty awesome play.
---
He didn't accept my friend request, which I mostly blame on the terrible people who play this game and their toxic attitudes about other people highrolling.
---
So now, here I sit telling random internet strangers about it instead of sharing that conversation with the internet stranger who was on the ride with me.
---
Depends what you mean with a good choice. Is it good enough to climb to rank 5? Yes. Is it good enough to climb to legend? It depends on how good you are with the deck and how good you know the meta but yes, you can climb to legend with it. Is it fun? This is the more subjective question, for me it’s really fun because I enjoy the more controlish deck and you have powerful finishiers.
---
OTK Paladin is the most boring shit though, really wish Paladin got some good control tools/win conditions so they didn't need to play that crap.
---
I mean it's better than the virtue signaling Hong Kong garbage from a few months ago at least.
---
Right but when you're printing a parasitic mechanic you need to assume people are just going to shove all that shit into a deck as one package, and they will probably try to combine it with the other strong cards that the class has. Half the player base probably unintentionally built the current S tier deck simply by shoving the Galakrond cards into their existing Quest Shaman deck and hitting "play." They absolutely could have found that in play testing, and found that it takes a massive shit on almost anything else.
---
I think if you just changed Faceless Corruptor and Mogu, the deck would feel much more fair. They are the two swings that feel totally broken.
---
I wasnt playing the game at those times and support also confirmed i never opened them before.
---
Idk about fun losing to miracle rogue. It's one of those high roll decks that you either crush or get crushed, and it has nothing to do with either players skill, just the draw order of miracle rogue
---
Okay so there can't be secondary or even tertiary themes? Just because Shaman has 4 standard rush cards and Warrior has 12 rush cards doesn't mean Shaman doesn't have the rush theme, just that Warrior is THE class for rush if that's the playstyle you're looking for. Same thing with hunter and their 7 cards, do they not have rush as a theme just because warrior has more?
---
Also lackeys
---
To follow the other styles of the other cards: 1/1, 2/2, and 4/4  could maybe be plausible especially if we believe it's strong with the battlecry synergies. I actually didn't notice that this is the only outlier.
---
It is just based on luck. It's a normal treasure with an offer-rate penalty. There's no condition to seeing it. It's just rare.
---
Luckily I did not buy any expansion packs because I know bliz has never changed
---
I can't sit here and say ''not true you're bullshitting''
---
But it's not very hard to know that priest has like the Galakrond removal 2 single target removals and 2 silence everything and destroy it.
---
So, no it doesn't beat shaman or makes a ''very good counter'' specially since shaman fills up the board every single turn with 2/1 rushes and can just discover bloodlust and kill priest.
---
4 in 104, so glad I don't spend money on this
---
the opinion of the day gets reposted in various forms and upvoted until the entire front page is nothing but the exact same post.
---
I still get destroyed by shamans if I don't highroll Apothecary/Zilliax. The only way to beat Shaman is to pray that Galakrond/double invoke card isn't in his top 10 cards. Of course in that case all deathrattle/Galakrond cards are in the bottom half of the deck. Literally the only 2 times I could beat Shaman I had a board full of 7/7's on turn 8 and he didn't have his Galakrond.
---
Honestly they should change fleshshaper to 8 Mana, firstly that would make it a worse card, but also the 9mana pool generally has worse stats than 8
---
Part of it is definitely human nature, but the game itself was designed to revolve around winning. Ranking up towards a 400 dust reward every month, progress on your golden/new portrait, even 10 gold for every three wins. Hell, up until recently over half the daily quests required you to win too, creating over 4 years of winning-is-everything mindset that most active players have by now. Which sucks, because that means changing things now would not amount to much, since it's already too late.
---
It's not the player's fault that he would rather get the rewards mentioned above instead of the big feeling of disappointment that he gets when he loses specifically because he didn't play the meta deck of the week. That's why I'm not blaming the players, or the deck trackers, or the meta websites, or even human nature. I'm blaming the design.
---
The effect is well suited for rogue and matches the class identity, i think it's a bad idea.
---
Blizzard support are generalists, they often don't know the ins and outs of particular games. They're very polite but if you're really clued into one title you probably know more about how it works than the average CS they employ.
---
I think this is the first of this subreddit, very nicely done!
---
I accidentally burned my Galakrond and I still won the game because of Shudderwock
---
it’s absolutely necessary imo, if you get into a mirror matchup it will come down to who can play Galakrond into Shudderwock the fastest
---
Please
---
Thank you for writing this, it was a great read. Especially for someone like me who's returned to the game after the announcement of DoD. I really hope Blizzard doesn't takes a month or even more then two weeks to make some adjustments. I've already lost motivation for ladder because of how ridiculous Shaman is atm.

Why not just stop playin Standard blizzard might wake up
---
Eh.. that's the issue. These few first weeks are supposed to be a fun time for experimenting but the meta just set in so fast that buying packs and making fun decks feels awful..
---
Yeah the one where they thought moorabi was actually playable
---
This was a friendly game?
---
yes
---
*YOU CAN'T CALM THE STORM*
---
Mage got shafted the most this expansion :/
---
My fear is that they won't change anything, but say to wait for the adventure that is gonna add 35 new cards, as they're sure that will change the meta. Which will leave us with Shamanstone for at least another month and a half.
---
Way I see it, unless they give all other classes a strong double invoker, some really crazy stuff, and basically give Shaman pure trash, the new cards won't make a dent. Honestly not sure if any cards could, unless it just flat out destroyed your oppontents hand and milled them.
---
I hope I'm wrong, but I reallywouldn't be surprised if they use the new adventure as an excuse to wait with tweaking anything.
---
I did this with lazul as galakrond priest, won the game as shaman.... Shamanstone confirmed once more.
---
You play at eu?
---
My time is way to valuable to waste doing something like this - it’s not their fault the deck is doing well. If it wasn’t shaman people would hate something else. Maybe spend this time to think of a counter deck?
---
Oh yes. That's really making the situation better.
---
idk what that is so i’m gonna say no
---
No point buying when one class will just dominate. Might as well cost on F2P and hoard your dust for whatever is the "best" class. I too think I am done with pre-purchases.
---
Get 1000+ cards, and all it takes is 30 to win. So much fun /s
---
OP: "I find it disappointing that despite being an expansion promoting dragon synergies with a host of new dragon minions and 'if you are holding a dragon' cards, the top deck so far uses neither dragon minions or dragon synergy cards."
---
You: "GaLAkRoND LOL"
---
EU server or other?
---
I don't think it's that easy but changes need to be made fast
---
&gt; Hopefully our actions show how much we want to make Hearthstone great.
---
... again.  On the real though that whole statement reads like some sort of non statement similar to politics these days.  Says words without actually saying anything.
---
"So, other than that Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?"
---
Really wish I could get a gold refund
---
Weakness: they can only play 30 cards in their deck

---
Improvise. Gentle Megasaur. Overcome.
---
That’s really not an accomplishment mate. That’s pretty easy.
---
Look on the bright side
---
At least it isn’t old pirate warrior. That deck killed experimentation so fast by killing on turn 5 and 6. Was probably the worst post-launch Mets ever
---
Blizzard won’t invest into hearthstone. 
---
It’s basically become their new business model. 
---
Low team numbers, little support. Just make a good return on investment and call it a day. 
---
Hearthstone will be bled out until people stop playing.
---
That sucks but what exactly needs addressing here? As long as you aren't buying enough to have all the legendaries, it's gambling with compensation (dust).
---
Let me just preorder and pay $125 for 80% of one expansions cards or buy 5x AAA titles
---
[removed]
---
No according to the OP’s clarifying comments. 
---
&gt; Well i didnt get one after 11 packs and i am certain i never opened those packs before(support also confirmed that i didnt) so i dont know, i guess they changed it.
---
I stopped using bandersmosh in my GS deck, not reliable enough for me imo.   
---
I've won a bunch of games at the hands of Shudderwock. Its a ridiculously good card, but I would only think its necessary in a quest shaman build. If youre going pure gala shaman or overload gala then you don't really need Shudderwock, but for a battlecry quest shaman its necessary imo.
---
This stats are shit don't look at them. Literally the worst stats you can pull from any where. Look at top deck lists from each class that have decent play rates and win rates.
---
To be fair, he wasn't the only one. There were a lot of streamers that suddenly were playing BG.
---
And that says a lot about the new expansion if people who started playing OG hearthstone just can't bother to play the new expansion because BG hearthstone is just more engaging.
---
I don't know. i think it should be a bit of an alarm signal personally.
---
Sadly, they could well wait for two months and claim if were to monitor things, because of the 35 cards from the adventure in January. They might well hide behind that and claim that they want to see if those doesn't change the meta first.
---
I went undeafeated 12 games in a row with highlander hunter at rank 3 and it was totally my skill and not variance or luck because I am in fact a pro player AMA :) I can also share the decklist I stole from hsreplay!
---
I remember that deck fizzling out once you made past the early game... hm.. I dont remember. But for argument sakes not even it was dominated by 40% of the ladder
---
Just logged in to play arena.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
LMAO
---
NICE GAME GUYS 
---
ROFL MAKE SURE YOU GO FIRST BTW
---
I don’t want to sound harsh here and I am happy for you - it’s exciting to climb and do well but most folks that take the ladder seriously get to rank 5 in about an hour so you won’t get many pats on the shoulder here. Gratz see how far you can climb.
---
Actually they wrote it off as "yeah that was our bad but our pipeline for pushing fixes out is so slow that we couldn't swap in another card until like the last couple days of the event anyway so we decided not to bother"
---
Given the current state of Battlegrounds, I'm not so sure about that. They broke that meta, too, and have been silent thus far on any fixes in the pipeline.
---
Just priest. You get your classes respective hero powers
---
Then i must be extremely lucky or something cuz i got a legendary in the first 5 packs of every old set i opened
---
I don’t understand how Shaman keeps getting disgusting decks. 
---
Their OG pre-Naxx decks weren’t the greatest, but after Naxx and GvG they were never bad. 
---
But the meme about Shaman being trash persisted. 
---
So Blizzard gave them the most disgusting cards in TgT and Old Gods and have just continued giving Shaman every tool to be dominant. 
---
One day I’d just like to be able to play with some hero diversity.
---
Back in my day that card would have been a 9 mana 6/6
---
Not crazy. The idea of banning a class prior to queueing is something that has been discussed many times. I personally would like to see it.
---
Nerfing the quest wouldn't fix anything, the best version of Galakrond Shaman currently doesn't even run the quest.
---
i know "the best deck" doesn't run quest but quest shaman is still one of the best decks remaining. what do you think will happen if they only nerf galakrond? it will be quest shaman on top again. people don't run quest version because of the mirror match is better without quest. and it's not only about using quest, just because it exists, shaman gets good battlecry minions and battlecry synergies that work with or without quest. look at the list. so many good battlecry minions, you can be sure they had quest shaman in their mind when making most of those cards. and it's interesting you chose to ignore shudderwock. don't tell me it's not an op card. it has been op and broken since it has been released. deathrattle has a lot less cards than battlecry, and even then it caused lots of problems with nzoth. it's totally possible to make a fun game without printing cards like shudderwock, nzoth or shaman quest.
---
Priest was definitely the best deck pre Evolve Shaman. It actually took some skill to play though so it wasnt the most played class.
---
Propaganda
---
Its a stupid class, that is severly overturned, but a win is a win. It doesn't change the fact that there is a problem with balancing in the game though.
---
What are your thoughts on the current meta? This sub being reactionary doesnt come from nowhere. Perhaps people are getting better at the game. But the past few expacs have seemed like standout meta decks dominate faster. Theres no doubt that people are losing interest very quickly, or is that perfectly fine for now?
---
Hopefully they'll start nerfing Shaman cards so that they don't have to decide which ones to put in the deck. it's always a shame to make a deck of 30 broken cards and still have 20 more left in your collection that don't fit.
---
necrium apothecary can't wait any longer
---
The quest version seems like it is weaker to aggro to be fair.  The quest never has made sense to me in the list though.  The deck wants to end the game on 7 or 8, which is usually right when you’re starting to get value out of the quest hero power.
---
Without the quest though it’s more indicative of just how powerful Rush is as a defensive mechanic.  It’s all the good parts of Rush Warrior from the Witchwood meta but with the finishing power of old school Midrange Shaman.  Just disgusting.
---
I've had the most fun playing Cruel Dinomancer Warlock, take a look at that. Its less known so seeing plauers try fruitlessly to remove your Dinomancers is hilarious. You don't need Rivendare, but Umbra is kinda needed for the big power play. She's from Frozen Throne. Umbra isn't used much elsewhere though. Deck only gets countered by hyper agro or control Preist (Plague of Death/Psych Scream)
---
Reno Mage is strong. I climbed like mad with Tempo Kingsbane Rogue. Tinkers Oil is busted.

C'thun Shaman is nostalgic fun.

Fuck I really want to disenchant the golden one
---
What deck do you play to climb ladder, the 37% winrate deck or the 68% winrate deck?
---
When a player is given the best deck in the game, do you expect them to just not use it?
---
How in the hell is this the community’s fault?
---
Winrates by percentage. Source: [https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/data-reaper-live-beta/](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/data-reaper-live-beta/)
---
aaaaaaaand it's banned
---
ya and make it a shaman card to so it fits with the theme
---
&gt;Shamanstone has definitely been fun for a lot of people, because the ladder is full of Shaman for months.
---
I'm not entirely convinced this part is true. I feel like so many people by nature of the game and people, dislike losing more than the enjoyment we get from the decks we are playing. I.e Shaman isn't necessarily fun, winning is fun. As a predominate Shaman player (who values fun over winning) I haven't touched the class in months besides the occasional murloc and even decks. 
---
So while I agree on a lot of your points, I think there is less or a correlation between 'fun' and 'strong' as you might think. I personally can't wait for nerfs because it will naturally create more interesting decks, and give them room to shine.  
---
TL:DR People like to have fun, losing isn't fun. Shaman main, who agrees with nerfs.
---
Yeah but then realistically you just ban your biggest counter class every time, regardless of how OP shaman or whatever the next thing that comes is.
---
Like if I am gonna play tempo rogue back in RoS, I will just ban warriors and sweep
---
I mean, if you want to climb then they're right, holy wrath paladin is the correct meta choice. Now if you're like most people and enjoy the game casually then that's totally fine! some people just want to win, nothing wrong with that
---
Whales aren't the majority. If 100 people buy a $50 pre-order that's $5,000. A whale doesn't buy $5000 per expansion. Maybe per year. 
---
People who pre-order are their target audience, it's a good middle ground and sustainable. 
---
Except those people are leaving.

They'll try and sell us the counter with adventure that is coming out soon.

Yeah maybe, I think it would have to modelled to see what it would do to a meta before implementation.
---
Those didn't work like that, maybe Jaina but nobody kept her as if it was aggro it was a dead card until 9 and if it wasn't you really didn't need her.
---
Speak for yourself.
---
Oh so getting a random turtle from your second GvG pack is just pure luck?
---
Combo priest was brought by basically every GM and was among the most commonly shielded
---
I'm trying to think - has there ever been a meta that the community and 3rd party data trackers indicated was a huge problem that just solved itself without either a balance patch or a new set release to change the meta? I certainly can't think of one.
---
200 euros a year, maybe, but only if you want to craft a top tier deck for each class. Otherwise you can get by with buying a pre-order for every other expansion
---
it’s much harder to kill four 8/8s than it is a 32/32, theres a lot of single target removal compared to massive aoe removal, also against a 32/32 taunts are much more effective
---
No.

---
&gt;Why even reply when you're just having a conversation with points that you invent yourself rather than the ones you're actually presented with?  
---
Quoting you and keeping the context on exactly what you have said isn't make stuff up chum.    The only way the points are imaginary is if you are imaginary (no such luck).
---
I hope you've got better in the rest of your response (doubtful).    
---
&gt;My comment you initially replied to was in response to something someone else said.   
---
My reply was in context to what you posted.  Just saying "no it's not" without any "logical" way of pointing out how it isn't is just rather silly.  
---
So far, no better.  
---
&gt;You keep talking about sample size, but that's still not the same thing as getting an accurate idea of how the majority of players or the average player feels. The two are not the same thing.  
---
We use sample sizes to get an idea of how the majority think and feel.  Go look up "focus groups" for one example.  And well if they don't work then chasmang the reddit champion knows better than most of the business retail world.   
---
Still no better.  
---
&gt;I don't believe that at all. If anything, even if Reddit somehow was an accurate representation of the game's audience user-wise, it would still be pretty unreliable in terms of getting a feel for the pulse of that audience because of how the voting system works.  
---
The voting system has nothing at all to do with gauging the general feel of a major issue.  
---
Case in point - go find me opposing views with equal upvotes that think Shaman is in a good, fair place right now and that Blizzard are doing great at releasing nice balanced sets or even that people really enjoy broken mechanics.  
---
I'll wait.  
---
&gt;You want me to respond to your logical fallacies now?  
---
Would you please stop using terminology you clearly don't understand.  Catch phrases and buzzwords only work if you use them in a context that actually makes sense.  
---
Yet again though you've failed to argue against the BF2 case which is the perfect example of an online userbase's (that you would state is a minority based on your previous replies) feedback to improve a product because not to do so would have been detrimental to the product.  
---
Who would have thought listening to the players of your game on reddit/forums FOR the players of your game was a good thing?    
---
For you to be able to argue that reddit is not a good place to get a feel for the community would basically impyling that you could equally assume the opposite of the general sentiment could be factual to the community.  
---
So ... do you honestly believe the playerbase as a whole by majroity think shaman is in a good place and fair?  
---
Can you point out any examples of where reddit (by majority consensus) on large issues has been way off for this game to what the majority of the playerbase felt?  
---
I mean surely you have some examples to support your weak and flimsy argument right?
---
The biggest problem in my opinion are the 2/1 rushes if the even put them at 1/1 it would change the power a lot
---
Thankfully the deck is overall pretty cheap, unless someone's really new and even then...
---
We'll have to see what changes happen of course, but staying T1/2 would definitely be good, decks being destroyed (unless there's no way to fix a broken combo) is never really good.
---
Oh okay, thanks for clarifying. Had only played against it a few times so I wasn't too sure on the source of the problem.
---
I don't personally play shaman, but you have to consider that f2p players are the majority of the playerbase, and they will always want the strongest deck possible to reach rank 5 consistently. I'm pretty sure that if most people had a plethora of cards, they would play a good variety of decks, but that's just not the case. This is 100% on blizzard, not on the playerbase.
---
Chakki be fuckin’ up!
---
I’ll have you know my old ToggLock deck boasts a 30% win rate!
---
At rank 3, the two forms of Galakrond shaman make up about 46% of games played in the past 24hrs, about 60% at rank 1.
---
So that's just variance, really. Also, I mean, you *are* the shaman in those scenarios.
---
Yeah it's better 5 13 13
---
Was revisiting Jumbo Imp today and just scratching my head. The “when in hand” requirement just ruins it.
---
lmao are you such a fool that you think its acceptable for this right now after people paid money for it?  
---
"Oh don't play it right now, even though you paid for it."  
---
right.
---
Quest Warlock and Priest are really fun, though Questlock is super expensive. I'm trying to build it after unpacking two of the required legendaries and I'm still not close rip.
---
Its better to do your whole turn and then wait for the rope, so you let them know what they're doing is wrong.
---
No stop playing is uninstall and never play again.  take a break means to chill out for a few, then come back.
---
Thanks for the news Chris! Really appreciate everything you do for us as a community
---
Opening day is so fun for every expansion... what you’re talking about it’s how the first 48 hours should feel like except team 5 messed this up by giving shaman EVERYTHING.
---
It's actually insane how good shamans invoke cards are. That's to me one of the major reason shamns are so good right now, they're galakrond payoff cards have no cost to runnig because the invokes are so good you'd want to put them in a deck without the payoff cards.
---
I just played wild secret mage and beat him pretty easy
---
There's a bunch on HS top decks. Lots of little variations on it. Doesn't look like any one list is coming out on top at the moment. The pure galakrond list is a lot more flexible in terms of what you can run. Some have board clears, most use far sight.
---
Whilst combo will always maintain some viability it really would be nice for another archetype to be strong. Quest had potential and was/is decent but needs some more support. Galakrond... needs a lot more support. But maybe they'll change something.
---
See this would be a fair point, except you are putting words in my mouth. Focus on the problem at hand and not whether "abusive partner" implies physical violence, because clearly it does not.

I knew quest galakrond shaman was going to be insane even before galakrond was revealed.
---
I even joked that they hadn’t revealed him because they thought we were gonna be salty about it cause it was too strong.
---
I jinxed it boys we should just ban me instead
---
Just play secret mage then if you can.
---
They HAVE to hit either Mogu or Mutate too.
---
But Mogu to 9 mana means having to deal with a 10 drop instead of an 8 drop.
---
Sincerely - thanks for the update and for being proactive about balance.
---
Ok
---
It's supposed to be the first 10 you open of a set, if you opened even 1 pack from a set before the change, sometime between Un'goro and Frozen Throne, it isn't supposed to apply to you
---
Yep, and i recognized this on day one within like 10 games. I just wasn’t having fun. I was winning with decks that i hate and losing with decks that I like. I’ve been playing since closed beta and this is the least fun I’ve ever had at launch of a new set.
---
Barista is more forgivable since they have only seen play in shaman.
---
wait, can we Disenchant galakrond?
---
Which cards will be affected do y'all think?  I want to make sure that I craft them beforehand
---
You joke but aggro Overload Galakrond Shaman is legit scary in Wild right now even if it isn’t really seeing play. The new 1/3 elemental, Tunnel Trogg, Totem Golem and Storm’s Wrath from the new set make for some downright terrifying opening turns. 
---
Aggro is looking to even more prevalent in Wild after this set than it was before, and it was already easily the most dominant strategy. I had a Pirate Warrior actually deal 20 damage to me by turn 3 today. Not fun.
---
We are paying for a product. We should not be positive that a product was "shipped" in a shitty state and be forced to wait for an update.
---
Remember this is a company that laid off a large number of it's work force a few times the past decade and hires new people at a lower pay.
---
This is nothing to be positive or thankful for. You get what you pay for, they are paying lower wages for lower level employees and trying to put out AAA quality games.
---
So every other time something was broken and not fun it got drawn out for months and was not fixed, but the moment I like a deck like Gala Shaman, and two days into card release a nerf is hinted at...pretty lame.
---
Using quest lowers win rate by like 2 percent
---
And they’ll make the quest complete with just 4 battlecries maybe.
---
Whichever intern they have on Tableau/Power BI is earning his keep.
---
Well, that's an issue too. You should submit a ticket to Blizz
---
&gt; We are paying for a product.
---
Well I'm not.
---
Exactly. Good job shitting in the bathroom, bad job you shit on the floor.
---
Boo this man. Keep inconsistent shudder in standard
---
this is great
---
If you're having that bad of a time, why not just not play? I've always found it odd that people can be frustrated with a game so much to the point where they allow it to change their behavior. Seems like the healthier option would be to just turn the game off and play something else that you find enjoyable.
---
We can pray priest really doesnt have much more right now and maybe the new solo adventure can complete a strong dragon package for priest to do
---
galakrond now summons 8/8s with *charge*
---
Its funny when otk paladin almost always beats gala shaman
---
Have you never heard of arena?
---
The announcement said it was retroactive, provided you hadn't opened them previously
---
Quest lowers the win rate but I do agree it’s unfun to play against
---
A lot of cards haven't been able to see any real play due to the overwhelming percent of Shaman decks being played. After the nerfs we can expect other cards/decks becoming OP by default.
---
Barista definitely won’t get a nerf as it’s not an issue, same with Kronx. While Kronx is a good card it’s not what’s making the deck broken.
---
wasn't it in highlander mage (standard and wild) before too?
---
Look up the original announcement, it was made during Un'goro, and send a link to support in your reply
---
Maybe make it like, a basic card
---
I just only play the single player and tavern brawls
---
The set is full of crazy power creep cards.
---
But it's effect is a bit powerful for 4 mana. We should balance it by giving overload (2).
---
God I long for those days.
---
I don’t really think you can throw a limit on what an abusive partner is because there are different forms of abuse and it affects everybody in different ways 
---
And even if we let that part go, you’re comparing the worst part of somebody’s life that can stick with them for years to being upset over a video game being unbalanced.
---
&gt; never changes
---
&gt; announces balance update last hour
---
ok.jpg
---
And then you die to Shudderwock.
---
Ya well they hired Cora who I have no ill will too, who told us on her own twitter it wouldnt be until next June before she had any idea what was going on in the game. Search her twitter, she actually said it. Why was this hire made then?
---
As a meanie who rages, I’m sorry.
---
Someone recommended shudder only using minion battlecries and that sounds fair but would they do that and have to refund dust do you think?
---
You realize this makes no sense, I'm not claiming you're advocating for people not to complain about the meta. Just make sure your complaints are valid. Anyway you clearly can't engage on the facts so enjoy the block.
---
Which is why I’ve gone to Wild. Reno Dragons Priest is a current favourite and I’m having fun with it. Standard Priest decks really are nowhere right now.
---
Do they even play their own game? It boggles my mind how people who work on this game for years, and specialize in game development, release an unbalanced monstrosity like this expansion.
---
I think that was pushing it to mobile, iTunes has a two week update acceptance period so it’s a while before a patch can go live
---
\&gt;  full Arcane Dust refunds 
---
PRAISE
---
If they continue this trend itll be very good for hearthstone to target anything that is a big issue
---
It will be somewhat tainted though. Why can't we have a great start you know? This situation is completely unavoidable too. If us players can see the oppressive strength of shaman after the first 5 hours. Why couldn't they?
---
"Bonus lasts until the **next** expansion launches"
---
After watching krip's stream he did mention holy wrath paladin being very strong against galakrond shaman.I think they still may need some tines with rush or dragons pack but maybe they are tolerable
---
Crushing paladin in this expansion is like crushing flowers bro just let em be
---
Yeah Hearthstone does have an inherent problem because the attacker gets to pick the targets, so in a tempo game going first is ridiculously overpowered. A lot of times it felt like the first person to play a minion wins. Rush was meant to solve that, but it's gone SO overboard at this point that it's more like the person who plays the *last* minion is the one who actually gets to attack face. 
---
Dr Boom should have shown them how awful it is when everything has Rush, but I guess they didn't learn that lesson yet. Considering this set is full of weapons and hero attack buffs though, it seems they un-learned the lesson about Charge damage as well.
---
Sure.
---
Why not risk your livelihood just to bitch online?
---
He dropped his /s if you want to help find it 
---
(And it’s lose, not loose)
---
Imo it's an auto include in many decks.Its assassinate except it can destroy multiple if them in your opponent's board or even hand it deck which has some crazy value sometimes.Its definetly going to be great to have for the next 16 months for rogue.
---
Ever been to this sub before?
---
Shadowreaper killed Raza. I’d take 0 mana heals over Shadowreaper any day.
---
It just sucks so much. We endured evolve shaman while they deny all problems. To start a new season with the same problems over again
---
I think people still have PTSD from tunnel trogg.
---
Shaman’s Galakrond isn’t as ridiculous as it seems when compared to the other Galakronds
---
Warrior gets +16/+16 worth of stats on 4 different minions, Rogue gets 4 free cards whenever they want to play them, Priest wipes out half your board and Warlock... Warlock is kindof bad I’m not gonna lie.
---
The problem with Shaman is that, currently, he can invoke Galakrond too fast and too efficiently, plus the value he gets out of invoking him is unrivaled compared to every other class (free 2/1s with rush anyone)
---
I’d say Shaman needs a nerf directly around his Invoke-synergy cards. Obviously, double invoke on Shaman’s Galakrond is insane because you get 7/5 worth of stats from a 5 drop, with rush. 5 mana 10/18 isn’t fun either, especially considering how easy it is to invoke Galakrond on Shaman right now. Maybe even Galakrond himself on Shaman deserves a nerf, cuz invoking him gives you so much more immediate value compared to every other class (warrior gives you +3 attack but you have to trade with your hero, rogue gives you a free lackey but they’re not enough to completely outvalue your opponent, warlock is just upgraded silver hand and fills up your board with useless 1/1s, priest gives you a **random** priest minion, which means you might not always get what you want)
---
I think I’ve made my point clear enough
---
It never was an auto-win - that's missing the point. What it did do was force me to play very face aggro decks (basically the evidence you provided except OTK paladin).  Some of use just want to play more mid-rangey stuff without getting obliterated by Shaman. 
---
If you are a meta-focused player, good for you. But I just like to play certain deckstyles that are completely stifled out now. I'm on a 9 game win-streak myself with Dragon hunter - which you would say it proves your point - but its not what I want to play.
---
I don't think mage has really been bottom tier in a long time, even after the nerfs mana cyclone mage was and still is a pretty strong deck.
---
And in wild secret mage is one of the best decks you can play
---
I really hope they don't nerf the quest directly. Wild quest jade shaman is my favorite deck, and the deck is struggling enough as-is.
---
This post did not age well.
---
Blizz literally has made a post about the state of the game. Balance changes incoming. So... wanna revise anything or are you OK with what you have drafted here?
---
There should be accountability for allowing this mess!!!
---
They sat and twirled with thier thumbs and got away with  the last Shamanstone
---
I thought it was a safe bet considering I actually had faith that Blizzard would playtest the Galakron decks of all decks. I believed the meta was unknown and people just needed to figure out the counter deck. Then the counter deck would be popular and it would all sort itself out. Not even 72 hours and they nerfing cards? Huge oversight. I hit legend with the deck and considering it was against 75 percent shaman mirrors guess I should have known that it wasnt just a hype train.
---
I see your point. But that means they suck at this job because this is not the first time shit like this happens.
---
It's what we do.
---
Quite honestly, I'd like to see it nerfed into the ground of barely being playable.  Which would still be a Tier higher than Priest ATM.
---
...it took 2 days to figure this out. What the fuck kind of testing do they do or don't do beforehand?
---
Sure! 
---
As I said [here;](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/e9z7bd/tired_of_galakrond_shaman_come_to_wild_we_have/famtz63) 
---
&gt; I made two decks. Both Highlander Mage, one designed against aggro (this one) with possible outs against Control/Big decks with Kazakus and Zephrys. But mainly it survives by Brewmastering Reno Jackson, and Barista'ing him if he survives. Has taunts, Volcanic potion, and loads of healing.     
---
&gt; My other Highlander deck is called FUP Mage (P stands for Priest.. guess the rest) And is like a Highlander variant of Burn/Secret Mage.     
---
&gt; Runs Explosive Runes, Fireball, Pyroblast, Antonidas, Cloud Prince, Medivh's Valet, and so on, for tempo and burning down a slow deck before it can get to grips and lock me out. Has Zephrys for final push answers, and doesn't have Reno because it's not techhed against aggro decks, it wants to kill them before I'm dead.     
---
&gt; There's also Polymorph, Sylvanas, and so on, to disrupt their giant taunts/minions, and ruin their resurrect pool.      
---
&gt; One inclusion that doesn't fit is Frost Lich, which is just so good she fits in a deck that is looking to burn down an opponent, just because of the games I draw her against aggro, it's all over.      
---
&gt; If you want the decklists feel free to ask! Also feel free to adjust the decks, sometimes I'll modify one slightly if I start running into a certain kind of deck a lot. I removed Elise Trailblazer earlier as the pack wasn't of much value.     
---
&gt; I've been swapping between the two, taking guesses at if I'll be against aggro or control, and it's been working great.

---
So you're complaining about complaining about complaining? Now that's some toxic meta.
---
Yup, always works. Just like making posts on your cake day.
---
It also helps there is like 40 cards in battle grounds total, it's way easier to find the problem rather than just what the community is blaming.
---
Yeah. That double Invoke thing is kinda weird. What 5 mana 10/18 are you talking about though?
---
Think the entire deck could be bumped up a Mana cost and still be top tier, the hero power change I really like, it’s better than a vanilla hero power but not busted. Puts it in line with the others
---
Dragon Pack, summon 2 2/3 wolves and give them +3/+3 if you’ve invoked twice
---
I feel like I haven't gotten to play the game I pre-ordered. Everything loses to shaman... And playing shaman disconnects the game.
---
I'm glad things are being worked on. I'm not trying to complain...but it's definitely been an unpleasant launch for me.
---
I took an expansion off of pre ordering, then my lovely girlfriend got me the pre-order for my birthday. I haven't had the heart to tell her how disappointed I've been since DoD launched.
---
I really hope for some amazing changes coming up that make this set enjoyable or this will definitely be my lady pre-ordered... Because I will finally give up on this game.
---
I'm still holding out hope. Please don't let me down team 5.
---
They put the bare minimum into this game to retain a playerbase.
---
Shaman isn’t just battlecries though. It has other themes too, like elementals, overload. totems and murlocs. 
---
Every class has battlecries and there are tons of neutral battlecries. Lackies are not just a shaman effect either, every class has access to them, especially the other “evil” classes. The devs didn’t make everything about battlecries, they made a single quest that did.
---
It says within a week and they usually patch on Tuesdays, not to mention they have to redesign a few cards which would take a little time as well. Be patient and and play another game if you have to dude.
---
So if theyre doing it anonymously we wouldn’t know...
---
Hex wanna take a word with you
---
I’ve made a mistake btw, I meant 10/12
---
r/hearthstone moment
---
Oh yeah. I mean. I don't find them very annoying to deal with. Isn't that a 10/12 BTW?
---
By virtue of the sheer strength and value of the card, it will always be in contention for the last 10 cards of your deck. This card is strong enough to see Wild play and as such, will not be a wasted craft. Just don't expect it to be your win condition or main gimmick.
---
I mean. Its a game right? So i don't want to pay and play just to survive. I want to have fun.
---
Please, please, please: Fix Galakrond, not the quest. I know you tend to nerf older cards, because you want to keep up the excitement for new cards, but the quest really is fine as it is. Galakrond on the other Hand is what's definitely too strong.
---
The only thing that kept mage alive for the majority of HS was freeze mage, any deck other than freeze was bottom tier for the majority HS's existence.
---
And I said majority, not all.  Big difference.
---
Yes that’s what I wanted to mention
---
Arena is just who can draft the most new cards. I have not won a game where 4 MANA 8/8 WITH RUSH was played
---
Tell that to the literally 3 card adjustments they've made for Wild in just as many years, despite a meta far more stale and degenerate than it was even a year ago, thanks to standard power creep interacting with cards they were never meant to support, and vice versa. (Example: paladin's access to handbuff is severely limited in standard because of magnetic; Flamewaker wasn't a standalone win condition because cards like Magic Trick, Primordial Glyph, and Mana Cyclone didn't exist when it was made; Kirin Tor Mage was fine, because Mage didn't have secrets that could do any damage, so you weren't really cheating out guaranteed tempo dominance for the next 2-3 turns). Wild needs a banlist, possibly rotating, but it's not selling packs so nobody cares enough to give it an annual nerf to give the illusion they care. The only reason Wild even exists is because of the absolute mayhem that would happen if cards became absolutely useless after rotation.
---
Dragonmaw Poacher is getting Arena banned so at least you've got that going for you
---
After gathering enough data we at the balance team decided that summoning numerous 8/8 with rush as a battlecry effect is unhealthy, so we are nerfing shudderwock to 10 mana.
---
/s
---
Well boys we did it. 8/8 with rush is no more
---
I understand that you don’t understand because you are clearly super pro
---
Devs confirmed nerf
---
not to talk about combining gal with the quest
---
I'm saying every single expansion there's multiple front page posts complaining about some deck or another. It's not some one off "jimmy or timmy." There's no way to quantify this time as being "everyone" and the other times as not.
---
Yes. Nobody should be praise for their good work. Ever.
---
You can basically treat the Invoke cards like they have the Invoke effects printed on them. You actually still have to draw them and play them to get the effect, which is very different from Genn and Baku.
---
They have already announced that nerfs are coming., with an eta of further notice next week.
---
I LIKE EM BIG
---
I LIKE EM CHUCKY
---
Welp, that's why they sell preorders, not postorders.
---
darn i rerolled the happy hollows end quest because it was glitched
---
Which is kinda stupid...
---
I-I don't... I don't understand. Are you trolling or not? Because you posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/e83jyl/absolutely_unplayable/) just days ago. And on the off-chance you want to try and erase it, I've taken the liberty of putting it into a screenshot [here](https://i.gyazo.com/217c5e4a79aa4fe7f2ebd486d5e1e1c0.png).

This might be the part where you try to convince us you were "M-MERELY PRETENDING" but if you really gave that much of a fuck you wouldn't shit up the sub with the exact kind of post you apparently despise.

---
galakrond should stay at 7 mana, in pair with all others galakronds. What has to be changed is either the progression (2/4/8 is too strong, I reckon 2/4/6, although it won't be in pair with the other galakronds, or halve the status, like 1/2, 2/4 and 4/8) and remove/rework the double invoke minion, either adding a strong penalty (overload 1/2) or (my preference) being single invoke. All the other classes struggle a bit  to have full upgrade by turn 7, while for shaman is too easy. Also change the 5 mana double 5/6 (make the bonus 2/2 ?). If they touch mogu would be perfect. 
---
Apart from that, Faceless deserves to be nerfed too, ridiculous strong. Maybe up to 7 mana. Let's see.
---
Mechathun Warlock is a Tier 1.5 deck in Wild. It uses the quest. Just because it's not powerful in Standard doesn't mean it doesn't earn a place in one of the most powerful decks in the game.
---
I would like to see some buff to the other classes.
---
Warlock should be the only class that can invoke twice. And 4 random demons are just bad. Give us 4 6/6 taunts demons and I would say it is on bar with shaman.
---
Warrior aoe invoke card is badly designed. We want to play invoke proactively, not a situational reactive play. Make it gain armor or something else.
---
Priest removal invoke card should be 4 mana.  Rogue invoke card can be +2 attack.
---
And drahon druids really need some help. Class card mana reduction will do.
---
I wonder how plot twist elekk would work
---
I think OP is only referring to cards from that expansion. Otherwise there’s been a few more nerfs that have arrived quicker.
---
I agree with your predictions, will solve a lot of the issues.
---
And I thought Priest sucked during Rise of Shadows.
---
Fuck Wild. No one gives a shit about Wild
---
You aren't wrong.  This should have never made it live.  It kills the hype.  I can't imagine how testing could miss something so obvious.
---
Hopes: 
---
1. Mogu Fleshshaper: 7 Mana --&gt; 9 Mana. Seriously, that cards been a massive problem from the moment it came out. It's in EVERY shaman deck. If Fleshshaper doesn't see a nerf, it won't matter what other changes they make: Shaman will still be a problem. 
---
2. Corrupt Elementalist: 5 mana --&gt; 6/7 mana. Tbh, I think this card was straight up a mistake. NONE of the EVIL classes should have a "Double Invoke" card. Period. It just makes it far too easy to activate all of your other Galakrond cards. Just imagine this in Galakrond Warrior or Rogue for instance. Galakrond as a concept is ONLY balanced around the fact that it's supposed to be HARD to reach full charge. Not in Shaman though, for... some unknown reason? At least at 6 mana it'd make it a tiny bit messier for Galakrond Shamans to max out on curve.
---
3. Invocation of Frost: 1 mana --&gt; 2 mana. Don't. Give. Glacial Shard. Rush. :) Not for free, anyway...
---
4. Faceless Corrupter: 5/4 --&gt; 5/2. Uh, Wow. This card sure exists. Pretty much the easiest way to handle this card is to give it the "Almost Rager" treatment methinks and knock a few health points off of it, making it impossible to value trade or gain tempo with, but still kinda okay as a weird rush based removal card. We really don't need Oasis Surger for Everyone tho, that's for sure...
---
I think it's Standard time for 2 years of "Big Priest. Why do you lazy fucks listen now?? Where were you fuckheads with Snipsnap? Fuck you Blizztard.
---
It's what he leads with. As in what he thinks is the most important point to make. His entire post is about Shaman Quest. He brings up literally zero other cards.
---
Ohhh I see it now... Foreman Sven Sven hehehehe
---
being biased against an entire class is dumb but so is exaggerating the effects of nerfs or thinking playrate = power level.  
---
tempo rogue's winrate dropped less than 1% at legend the week after after the raiding party nerf and the second week after the nerf when people realized raiding party was still good it had an even higher winrate than it did the week before the nerf.  
---
https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-130/

the week before the nerf. at legend 51.17% winrate, 27.2% playrate.  
---
https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-131/

---
second week after the nerf. at legend, party rogue 51.24% winrate, 3.21% playrate.
---
I’d argue the opposite. In the 50% Shaman Meta it’s great against a board full of 8/8s, 5/4s or 5/6s.
---
If I still played this game, wild Dragon Mind Blast Priest would be the one thing I'd be playing.
---
Rank 15 is full of shamans.
---
You completly ignored the "in druid" part. Obviously its easy co clear. But what do you do in druid? Crawlers i guess
---
Shamanstone.. Oh... Wait... Nerf shaman 0_o
---
I wonder what cards will be targeted
---
I opened 5 GvG packs BEFORE the expansion release and I got a legendary.
---
I think I did once on day one
---
Blizzard getting a lot of mileage out of the beta testers on this forum.
---
Nobody cares about Wild, because nobody on Team 5 cares about Wild, so it gets literally one balance change per year. That being said, Warlock Quest is OBJECTIVELY one of the most powerful cards in Hearthstone's history. But it doesn't have full support in the Standard paradigm.
---
Did mother stole your Oger?
---
I seriously hope this isn't it. That's an over-kill nerf. Make the double Invoker 6 Mana, Faceless Corruptor 6 (or 7) Mana, and Mogu Fleshshaper a 3/3 and those are changes you can reasonably follow through with just off the top of my head. Similar to making Shudderwock 10 Mana.
---
Galakrond Hero Power being made a 1/1 *dramatically* reduces the efficacy of not just the Galakrond but his Invokers, which means getting to that point to begin with becomes much, *much* harder. I'd much rather hit a couple of cards a little rather than crush a build-around card.
---
&gt;Maybe gets put to 6 mana
---
funnily that would be a buff in wild since it could be played in even shaman
---
Galakrond is the main dragon of the expansion. "Oh no the best deck of the expansion is built around the brand new dragon hero card and the newly introduced mechanics relating to that card."
---
Judging by your downvote, it's pretty obvious that you're either unwilling, or simply incapable, of thinking. Was worth a try at least. Oh well.
---
Like Rabble Bouncer?
---
Eh, I wouldn't be too against it. It would probably kill the card, just like Rabble Bouncer doesn't see play. But it is part of a 4-card package (Fleshshaper + Mutate) and not the entire deck, so hitting Mogu Fleshshaper hard is not the worst thing in the world.
---
I would not be against it being **friendly** minions instead, though. Either direction is interesting, but Rabble Bouncer is already the "comeback Taunt" card, Mogu Fleshshaper could still serve to be the "Push the advantage Rush" card, just much less powerful at it.
---
The Nozdormu Bug is back, please look into it. I just had it and lost a game because of that. I was playing as a Shaman against druid. The guy used the card when it's drawed then it summons a random dragon into the table. It summoned Nozdormu. My round was immediately skipped. This happend twice. Please look into it.
---
Why aelre you playing around a card (mc tech) most shamans arent playing?  Unless you are like rank 15 where they are all quest shaman which would also explain how you win with priest.
---
I run a singleton galakron control dragon warrior with the two mana gain two dragons, and honestly I get double alex a lot in my games between that, other discover dragons, and Voor.
---
Lol, i bought 10 packs of GvG yesterday and got legendary, so, im just lucky?
---
I'm not re
---
1 star because Shaman won't see play
---
It's still got upsides, I played it day one of the expansion. I tried building mage with the [[Elemental Allies] sidequest by just playing a midrange curve of elementals + burn to finish off. It was pretty meh but I would always play Bonefire Elemental in that deck over big ol whelp. You can't elemental evocation out big ol whelp on turn 3 and it won't trigger your elemental allies so, bonfire was better.  The tribe alone can be a big difference
---
I'm of the impression that the vast majority of the Hearthstone team are just dudes who want to make a great game and get it out there to the playerbase. People who take pride in their work.
---
I don't think they care or particularly want to have the business model of Hearthstone be vicious (in terms of a video game: as a card game it's actually pretty generous), or are happy with being hamstrung in terms of how long it has taken to add new features or game modes to the game. I think those kinds of decisions come from higher-up.
---
I think they were responsible for the initial reluctance to act on balance and make changes quickly, but they're learning and have shown a lot of willingness to adapt that mentality lately.

---
12 damage for 3 mana wtf...
---
It's already nerfed, if says if you have a dragon. And usually nobody has that so it's a good stopper. /s
---
Yea 1 card a year out of 100. Every best deck for each expansion has been predicted before hand. Not since cublock has a deck come out of nowhere.
---
Youre just buying into reddit hot takes. Watch the actual ratings they put out, theyre mostly accurate.
---
Yes, it is substantial. The thing about Galakrond Shaman is that things come together quite a lot. In this respect, it looks a lot like Cubelock. And like Cubelock nerfs, I imagine these changes won't make you *not* run these cards, but just that the overall effectiveness of that deck will be weaker.
---
After all, you can't exactly scrap Corrupt Elementalist and Dragon's Pack in a *Galakrond* deck, can you? The Fleshshaper-Mutate combo might become too weak, but that's a 4-card package.
---
Faceless Corruptor at 6 Mana 5/3 is still probably very good, so that seems like a very solid nerf choice.
---
Exactly how I felt the descent of dragons realease
---
They explained that every other effect reads a card, and last, the text inside the card is applied, so when you draw it, it is 25 mana, when you read it, it's 0 mana, but if you conjurers calling it, conjurers read it first. And btw, that's inconsistent because 1 mana sea giants get magic carpeted anyway like they already costed 1.
---
I watch trump reviews everytime. Look at rereviews. Or his rerereiviews.
---
In this deck Far Sight is the best 3 cost spell to run with Spirit of The Frog. It's run in other decks because a majority of the deck is above 3 mana which makes Far Sight practically 0 mana draw a card.
---
Welcome to The Grand Tournament, champion.
---
Always look at the money.
---
Now that everyone who is on ladder has crafted  all Shaman cards needed for the 2 Shaman decks (and they are not that expensive) there may be a good number of players just ignoring ladder. It's understandable,  playing 80% of your games against the same deck you get bored. I have just 3 cards left for both decks and I am not even considering it; I got bored of playing against shamans. The meta before this exp. was quite healthy, there were a lot of Tier decks and you could play easily with few repeating decks till 10-5 ranks. Now all we have is Shaman.
---
What does this mean?. Any player who goes to ladder (not competitive but ladder after all) is either building a Shaman deck or giving up. What does this lead to?. Less sold packs; after all, you can only build 2 T1 decks on this meta...
---
So probably their stats say that they are selling less packs (my guess). How can they fix that? Either they power up other classes (unlikely) or they nerf some Shaman cards (likely).
---
I had 2 games vs. Reno Mage and 1 vs Renolock. A fully invoked Galakrond into Shudderwock was too much for them to handle. Small sample size though.
---
DONE
---
I just hold to shirvalah till the end of the game when i'm facing rogue, and yes hate me for playing only deck to my main that actually has decent win ratio
---
Congrats! 
---
I don’t think I will ever be able to get one class to 500 because I don’t have the willpower for that and I keep on switching classes every expansion for the most cheap archetype. 3 years and still I haven’t got one class to level 60 lol.
---
Galakrond is 7 mana though
---
Current HS replay winrate is 61%. Someone on reddit posted a link with a video showing the frequency of each class every hours after release. You can clearly see a peak of people playing Shaman and it completly explain the increase of winrate.
---
In rock paper scissor, if suddently rock can draw against paper, you'll have a sudden increase of people spamming rock. The winrate of paper and scissor will drop and the rock one will increase. Then everyone will play rock with the draw strat against paper in mind and the winrate will lower due to the mirror match-up.
---
What I want to say is that the current winrate fluctuation has nothing to do with a improvement of the deck. It's a normal behavior of stats. What is more worrying is that none of the other class improve which means that no other class found a way to beat Shaman even while focusing it. Usually when one class winrate increase it is followed by the increase of the counter but here nothing happen because the worst match-up of Shaman his the mirror match.
---
Nope, they literally said that they won't print anything besides cleric because priest is not suppossed to get card draw and actually they are considering nerfing to not offer card draw for the sake of "class identity" this was an explanation to a conversation Mike Donais had while talking about nerfing extra arms to 3 again. In the same note, Priest only has Cleric and PWShield. If you don't run those, you don't have any card draw except neutrals. Not like every fucking class out there that gets card draw like it was a cool thing to get and not a fucking game mechanic.
---
I've been playing sinceaunch but was casual till whispers and my friend built me murloc pally. I'm a pally main in wow so I was drawn to pally from the beginning. I've also been going back and forth between various decks throughout the years. I've had pally at 424 wins for probably a year so decided it was time to pump oit the remaining 76 wins with the new set
---
Just accept you're wrong bro, I also forgot about luna's and extra arms too.
---
Standard is very dull right now because the majority have joined the Shaman bandwagon. I don't mind the powerlevel of the deck - The problem is everyone is playing the one deck which makes games lack variety and are boring as a result.
---
Bugs happen.
---
The 9 mana add a copy of a card to your hand deck and battlefield onto shravallah + hankering zephrys have gotten me over the hump a good amount of times when that happens.

Sorry if it went south though. Sometimes you have to play the numbers and they just say no! Good luck friend. May the curve be with you.

oh which ones?

Winning based on drawing blade into apophrecary on turn 4 with a combo activator or alternatively an early 8 8 cleef is a high roll isnt it? just like drawing lunas on 7 was

frontpage bro, first pinned post i think.

If only I was wrong, but I am not. Extra Arms nerf is one year behind.

Pirkrond... Pirakrond? Galarate?

If your anti aggro combo is 9 mana it's not gonna work my man
---
I thank you.
---
That’s pretty good. I have been playing since 2014 but then I didn’t play the game between late 2016 all the way to early 2019. Honestly I would have probably got one golden hero by now if I played consecutively.
---
Hopefully Warlock is my first golden portrait as it’s my favourite class now that I pretty much resent Shaman decks and refuse to play them.
---
The 8/8 legendary is fine, I crafted it for wild and with the bigger cardpool there are combos with it...
---
Don't diss a good legendary bcs the other cards suck, it's not his fault
---
So fucking garbage that they did this.
---
Cleric by itself is more draw potential than any other class.  No class can cycle like priest can.
---
he has just 1 card left.
---
if you clear his board, he runs out of ammo. GG
---
Very
---
I've wanted dragon pally to be playable for years and now that it's possible with this new set I felt like it was time to just sit down and get that gold
---
I hope that shamanstone ends now. Basically since the event that brought bacj evolve 3 out of 5 games i played against shaman. Now its 3 out of 4. They really fucked it up but ty so much for the quick reaction.
---
The bosses in Solo Adventure are easy in comparison
---
Only one flaw in your logic: The pepple responsible for the bullshit dont read this stuff. The dev's who worked hard do. Cut em some slack.
---
Off of current (albeit community-collected data), one deck is completely stomping out everything else. It's lowest winrate is against itself, and it is either tied or nearly tied with the highest winrate deck of all time (depending on which data source you use).
---
They could wait for the community to try and find a counter and the meta to balance out, but they've done that too many times before and it rarely works. That's how we ended up with one deck dominating the meta for full years at a time like Midranged Shaman or Jade Druid.
---
faceless corrupter
---
6 Mana 4/4 would be fine
---
Galakrond Priest is high skill medium reward. Not many players are that skilled at this game
---
What are you doing in my other subs? gtfo back to pvd.
---
*laughs in Frost Lich Jaina*
---
Fire Fly and Tar Creeper were two of the most played cards and Tar Creeper was incredibly strong as a 3 drop. The reason they never got a tech card, like Crabs was because they weren't an aggressive strategy. They don't snowball on board like Murlocs or Pirates do. Any tech card they introduce now would only really hurt Mountain Giant. 
---
Frankly the 4/4, gain +4/+4 with Rush guy is a bit stronger than other tech cards because it doesn't have to kill the Dragon. It just gets numbers and can remove anything. But ironically there aren't many Dragons running around outside of Mage and some Warlock and Druid decks so the card is less impactful than some (myself included) expected.
---
No they don’t. Look at the stats, quest version is just straight up worse.
---
This feels like it's way too early for a balance change. It's probably going to end up being another Dr. Boom nerf - a card that didn't really need a nerf ends up being completely obliterated.
---
I honestly don't like Hearthstone's new directions, nerfs happen too frequently and often prematurely, leaving cards that would've been fine in time now completely unplayable for all eternity even after rotating.
---
If they'd at least revert the nerfs for cards that have no way of ever being an issue in Wild once the rotation happens then I'd be less upset about things like the Dr. Boom nerf and now the (most likely) coming annihilation of Quest and/or Galakrond Shaman.

Is your sample size 3 games?

Are you actually surprised the only tier 1 deck is getting nerfed?

The faceless nerf is not just for Shaman, its for everyone. 
---
[https://hsreplay.net/cards/#sortBy=includedPopularity](https://hsreplay.net/cards/#sortBy=includedPopularity)
---
50% of all decks in the meta use it.
---
If this were true, don’t you think Blizzard would come out and broadcast what the counter deck is?  Seems like they would rather do that than nerf cards but that isn’t happening.
---
Galakrond isn't op. Galakrond the Tempest is. Big difference.
---
Mogu + Mutate should give a minion 1 cost higher than what you played your Mogu at.
---
/u/Chris_Attalus Can Team 5 please fix the bug where 1/1 tokens from Bad Luck Albatross are incorrectly considered class cards? This is minor, but does affect Paladin minions with "if your deck has no Neutral cards" clause as well as Wyrmrest Purifier.
---
not my first legendary of the expansion . I played mean streets when it came out a little and bought the wild packs deal a few months ago. I dont know what it has to do with anything but my free golden was the paladan dragon that gives everyone 10 mana
---
Im just stating my personal experience man
---
what do you expect ? it’s turn 6 ! so it’s ....oh wait
---
Poacher shouldn't increase health. That way Poacher still gets a great Mana trade against big Dragons.
---
But, we got many elk jokes out of that.
---
I saw it yesterday, I really like to know if it's intended or not.
---
Tried to play around knowing that the shaman had it on hand, end up loosing either way.
---
10 damage worth of Rush for daring to leave a single minion up. Seems about right.
---
This is the first expansion where i log in on release and not a single person on my friends list is playing hearthstone
---
I feel that Bob would never make a player lose, hens equally supportive to everyone
---
Rr was leeching nerf no? That card was nuked from oebut in usability.
---
It only summons 4 if you’re playing a bad version of the deck though.
---
Is quest galakrond not the best version?
---
GJ my dude gratss
---
I don't think its a bug. I've seen other cards in hand highlight when they are buffed.
---
Regarding counter decks, like your Secret Rogue. This is a good strategy in tournaments, and occasionally on ladder when one deck is extremely popular, but most of the time on ladder, the best deck is, quite simply, the best deck. A counter deck on ladder only works if it can also stand against other popular decks - targeting just one rarely works.
---
Tournament strategy regarding best deck vs counter deck vs counter-counter deck requires a lot of skill and knowledge of your expected opponents. It isn't something that there's a hard and fast rule for, it's one of the areas where experience matters. And, of course, it also ties in with ban (and shield) plans. If you're unsure and just starting, then go for the most straightforward solution.
---
But maybe that's a bug too...
---
I beat a Gala Shaman with my Deathrattie Gala Rogue simply because he had bad card draw
---
I want a flat price tag for an expansion instead of upwards of $180 for an expansion. Not asking for much.
---
you mixed the words spellzerker (enrage: +2 spell damage) and squallhunter (shaman 4/5/7 overload2 spell damage +2)  
---
so kinda close?
---
i should calculate how much damage those wrathweavers did to me, it was something like 30 dmg lol
---
Id be glad with alot of basic and classic being hofed.
---
Means no gutting nerfs for them!
---
If I have lethal on board and the opponent passes back to me to 'finish' I assume they're asking to see what was in my hand. I'll just play everything I can as fast as possible and then lethal.
---
5 mana 10/12 Stats turn 5 
---
How could an developer of card games can’t see this is broken as fuck just within a second right after he saw this card
---
Hmmmm... it must be that dragonhoof fellas doing
---
Invoke 10 times or something.  1-1 without rush? And the summon a copy card fine cus of shudderwok is my Guess.
---
How about a new life?
---
It's awesome how most of ya lavish praise on these assholes for a "quick fix" as if they dont have teams of people that know this shit before they even release it. No such thing as bad publicity though... right ?  
---
Blizzard: "How can we gain favor after so many poor decisions? Well I'll tell you how! We'll release something so broken that people dont want to play but! we'll swiftly "fix" it to show how we care and just want nothing more than to take care of our commodities."
---
Priest is definitely terrible and in a really bad spot, but I guess I didn't realize just how bad it was this expansion. I didn't play last expansion at all and coming into this expansion I was excited because priest is my main class and reno dragon priest was my all time favorite deck to play. It was really disappointing after getting on to see that priest got arguably the worst help as far as dragon and galakrond synergy goes. None of them mesh, they all do seemingly different things and none of them do them even close to as effectively as the other classes. I've actually had a lot of success playing a wall priest deck I made with tons of resummon and galakrond. Won roughly 10 of 12 games from ranks 10-6, but I'm still just disappointed that it feels priest has the least amount of options as far as new cards and deck archetypes go. Would be cool if with the nerfs, blizzard rolled out some buffs for priest, but idek what they'd do and I highly doubt they will.
---
That's to radical for GAMERS.
---
Inspire: Bob hugs you
---
Not really, wild degeneracy is mostly fueled by specific synergistic interactions, I highly doubt you would see much of that with random sets.
---
when will Twin Tyrant's animation work correctly? I wanna see that ice breath!
---
Anyway how's your sex life?
---
People will literally say every deck is going to be good... this one time it happens to be true (half true - quest is NOT the best version of shaman). There’s a Nostradamus out there for every deck. Remember when people called keleseth garbage tier? People are notoriously bad at predicting which cards will be good until actually played.
---
Obviously this should have probably been caught in play testing but play testing environments are not refined by millions of players.
---
Idk man, I can deal with pirate warrior with my mage deck. It's not easy but if you can draw a few good cards and keep em busy until 5-6 mana, you can burn their resources pretty easy.
---
But they announced nerfs are coming to shaman soon?
---
Shaman players are Nerds indeed
---
Not necessarily true. If his comment helps OP improve his grammar moving forward I wouldn't call his words useless.
---
Do you even have eyes in your head?
---
Pretty much unlucky to have only 1 big minion
---
&gt;  Every shaman mirror depends on who gets their galakrond juiced up faster, plays It first. 
---
And why wouldn't quest shaman be as fast? They run the galakrond BFF, can have as much or more card draw.   
---
&gt; Just personal experience and watching 
---
So nothing. K.
---
As long as they can still high roll to draw that Ancharr, you’re probably right. Weapon destruction meta?
---
Well written.
---
This is such a new low though. I mean desert hare evolve is understandable, it's sort of difficult to see that it's op. But Galakrond ???? It's the whole point of the expansion and they can't do basic tests on this. It's astoundingly absurd.
---
No, you are breathtaking!!
---
That time period really just got delayed, not destroyed. There will be a wide open meta once shaman is not destroying all creative thoughts
---
Just noticed the wrath weaver- but doesn't change
---
Free Hong Kong
---
Isn't that a bug? I remember they said in the reveal stream that the first Galakrond in your deck will always be "your Galakrond"

It's any time there's a bolded keyword in the popup.

Yea....no. Just because a card can't deal with another doesn't make it worse than that card. 5/5 rush is comparable to 5/6 taunt.

I mean, I can understand if you enjoy playing Shaman. I do too, it’s a funny class, invoke, battlecry and evolve mechanics are fun actually. But if a class or deck is that dominating, the meta becomes boring very soon. Even if I enjoy playing a deck, it’s not enjoyable if you face the same deck over and over again. And this is the case right now. If every (!) other class but Shaman has a negative winrate, it makes absolutely no sense to not play Shaman, if you wanna climb seriously. And because of this single fact alone changes are needed soon ofc.
---
Congratulations! :)

Kibler hit Legend with Galvadon. Was that a broken deck? Pros can hit Legend because they have a much deeper understanding of their matchups than the average player; their is a MASSIVE skill difference between a rank 5 dad legend and the people who play as a profession, so don't go saying that just because a pro can play a strong deck to Legend on the day the meta is its absolute weakest actually means anything about the deck's power level. Priest is, and historically has always been, the ninth most powerful class in the game. Hearthstone draws a player base that prefers faster, less involved gameplay. Priest decks, due to their card pool and hero power, lend themselves to be slow control decks, often pushing to fatigue wins. When it's time for card design, the edge invariably will go to the aggro archetype to support the player base's tendency to prefer fast games. This leaves control archetypes far weaker and less synergistic than any other. The two times Priest has hit Tier 1 have both been on the back of combo and early aggression, something FAR removed from the usual Priest toolkit (aside from DS/IF, which Team 5 will forever force because that's Priest's "class identity" now). Just because it hit Tier 1 immediately after a series of nerfs and buffs that went horribly askew in a few specific circumstances (which were fairly promptly nerfed again) does not mean it was going to stay Tier 1 had Terror in the Tombs never happened. A 53% winrate is FAR from oppressive or unbeatable, especially in a meta that never really solidified due to Desert Hare/Evolve running unchecked for the next two months.
---
I really really hope so man, Hearthstone at its core, is freaking great.
---
But why only 100 people? Why not a pte? If they allowed streamers play the game before us, why not use a public test environment to see if something are broken? I'm not a good player, but just seeing the cards I knew it shaman would be broken

but they never said they gonna nerf shaman /s
---
Imagine her wet, undead ass sitting on your face.
---
Faceless Corrupter isn’t an invoke card...
---
Because nobody is playing Dragons because Dragonmaw Poacher is so scary. It's kind of circular logic I suppose and I could be wrong but that's my feeling. Getting blown out by a 4 mana 8/8 feels so bad that even if it is rare it's so soul-crushing people don't want to play those decks.
---
Congrats then. I just concede when i see shaman. Stars to legend ain't worth the trouble.
---
Nah dick head I'm talking about my own subjective fucking experience or are you to fucking daft to get that concept?
---
Sent them a tweet tho, their reply "Has restarting your system not helped?  ^PJ"
---
Enjoy your block, you're clearly unable to engage without being upset that someone dares challenge your opinion.
---
Once again moving the goal post. You're great at debate. Anytime someone presents a counter factual to your claim "Well actually I am going to move my statement to mean something else entirely.."
---
With news of the balance patch coming next week (praise Galakrond!), keep your paws off the disenchant all button. If you need the dust, find dupes of cards that are obviously not overpowered. Keep your Faceless Corruptors, Elementalists, and Dragon's Packs people. PSA over.
---
You're missing the biggin - Faceless Corruptor will be nerfed 5 -&gt; 7 mana. It's just obvious, it is the most busted card in the entire format, beyond anything else.
---
Now THATS shooting a ghoul.
---
&gt; i feel like galakrond shaman sucks, because i have low win rate with it
---
This is a personal subjective experience that i just threw in. Do you think it has any value? what you just said is no different than that
---
Good choice because playing against shaman right now is really frustrating. Games are definitely one sided.
---
Are the wretched reclaimers just there for chronobreaker? That's an expensive 2 card board clear. I've been thinking that it's better to just remove the priest dragons and replace with better dragons -- brightwing and scorcher.
---
Hell fucking no.
---
God reddit is just full of exceptionally stupid people today. Pointing out exceptions isn't moving a goal post, its an acknowledgement that things aren't black and white.
---
I think you mean lexicon. Because the sentence was grammatically pretty sound.
---
Right? Compare that to something like unleash the beast for hunter and faceless is laughably overpowered.
---
I love being blocked by people who start arguments. The guarantee that you won't start this trite with me again is comforting. Thanks.
---
I never did the whole run but by adding just the platebreaker, it saves you grinding through at least a 100 armour.
---
No it's showing that your logic is full of inconsistencies and you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Right so you felt the need to be so argumentative with me... why?
---
Prep nerfed to 2 mana
---
Does the game in its current form even support active decision on triggers (like Galakrond's HP triggering on invoke)? I think even with this change, the invoked HP would end up being random because of engine restrictions.
---
If this card goes dragon pack will annihilate us, the card is good but not broken, it's predominantly used for removal.
---
Yes I didn't pay attention :/
---
No...but thats probably because its a quest shaman  one and thats easy to beat
---
Pally class identity is that they dont get hard removal, they get debuffs. their sap/hex/poly/execute/SW:P equivalent is [[Humility]].
---
5 mana 3/3 stats would be perfect for faceless corrupter because then aggro decks wouldn’t wanna run it and even control decks would need a really good reason to run it

You can't blame people for wanting to play decks that win. Losing isn't fun. Meanwhile, experimentation is expensive and typically isn't very fun in the end because "creative" decks tend to be really bad. Otherwise, people would play those decks too.
---
Does being a cunt add any particular value either? I get it, you're life's fucking miserable but maybe go outside and make something of it instead of getting mad because someone put their own feelings on a forum, a place for debate and subjective fucking experiences.

---
Hoping some balance is aimed towards the shaman quest, rather then just bullying the epic cards blizz printed this xpansion
---
It's understandable that you want to play the best possible decks available to your collection. I mean, who doesn't like to win and reap the rewards. At this moment the strongest/best deck would indeed be Galakrond Shaman.
---
To answer your specific question between Galakrond Shaman and Secret Highlander Hunter, I'd personally go for Hunter.
---
This is obviously a personal opinion, but I find Secret Highlander Hunter just more fun in general. Also, if you read up on the latest ''Hot'' posts and recent post from the community manager, you'll see that they've already admitted that Shaman is just too strong and that nerfs will be coming in next week. This is mere speculation but, the community is raging so hard at Shaman being so overpowered for God knows how long, that I predict it's not going to be a little nerf. I see them nerfing Shaman down to Tier 1 or even Tier 2, giving the other classes a chance to get back into the meta and see significantly less Shaman. I mean let's honest, I think we've had enough Shamanstone for now.
---
Don’t call it a phase, we’re three days in, this IS the honeymoon. Trouble is, we booked a resort next to raucous shaman convention.
---
I mean... I do think Warlock and Priest are problems.
---
Warlock's Hero power makes zoo decks way too good, and they end up really preventing a lot of good aggro minions from being printed neutral, which limits how aggressive other classes can be.
---
As for Priests... Team 5 just doesn't seem to know what to do with them. Priest is a reactive class, so they keep printing reactive cards. This means that if they get good reactive cards, they can react to everything you do, and if they can't react they can't do anything.
---
I think the battlecry should be 1/2/4 3/3 Elementals with rush. Weaken the relationship with Shudderwock and the quest, make it far more vulnerable to AoE, make them much more likely die to the targets they rush into, lower the total stat spread some.
---
With the speed of these decks I think the 2 mana 3/2 Ooze would be the preferred tech, honestly.
---
Didn't work for me on either :(
---
more likely the OP already brought packs ages ago and the GM is clueless, as usual.
---
Nope, but $50 won't buy more than one deck, if that. It's just disappointing that spending 6000 dust and getting 1600 back will still make 5400 dust wasted. But I guess that's what I get for only being able to afford one deck.
---
*Laughs in undertaker*
---
Well met!
---
But you got even more salty about his reply.  Both versions are better than most decks out there.  Stop the mindless bickering.
---
This guy: bowmen
---
My hero
---
So soon? Absolutely. The Hearthstone team has a long precedent of waiting for about a month before making changes to give time for the meta to adjust and counter-decks to be constructed. This will be a first.
---
I'm going to be 100% honest. I hate priest. I loath priest. I find the class to be inherently the most unfun class to play around because it has several class identities which I think are problematic for the game. I think resurrect priest is a flawed idea because you just recycle the same minion your opponent is force to deal with again and again. I dislike innerfire combo because you leave one minion in play suddenly you are taking 24+ damage to the face easily. I think vellen otk's with resurrection or zeke's are also insanely frustrating to play against. There has never been a tier 1 priest deck that isn't absolute cancer to play against.
---
The problem is you can't change the hero power without changing the invoke. Priest has some of the better invoke cards for a reason, their galakrond is a value generator, not a tempo generator. If you allow them to discover, suddenly getting an early game minion from the one drop is fairly consistent rather than a high roll.
---
Togwaggle treasure
---
Dude all of your posts are basically speaking for the communities that you are a part of, and constant whining about EVERYTHING early on. 
---
If you're going to just moan about the games you play then why play them? Sad.
---
This is not the fault of anyone though.
---
Blizzard prints cards, nerfs and buffs are obligatory trough the expansion, its impossible to get everything exactly right and with a healthy, varied metagame every expansion.
---
Its not the problem of the playerbase for beig invested into the game and looking to improve as players, wich means looking for resources on how to play the game better, how to understand deckbuilding, and of course, sharing decklists and matchup experience.
---
Netdecking was REALLY fast in MTG even before the internet was popular. This is not something you can stop, nor blame.
---
At least you’re not playing it in casual.
---
Shaman in Tier one is much better than it being in Tier Shaman though.
---
You could also ask why the devs keep releasing broken cards instead of tuning down the power-level and having fun decks be at least somewhat viable? 
---
Oh yeah, because it’s harder to do then just pump up the power to 11.
---
I got you my guy
---
It is getting nerfed next week from what I heard.
---
When you have a 20% difference between the best and worst class, there is a problem : One class is stupidly OP or the other is incredibly weak. This seems like a Shaman problem, but I'd buff some Priest cards anyway. 
---
I never had any problems with Quest Shaman before, although I admit it is stupidly easy to complete for such a powerful reward. Making it 8 minions would already tone it down a bit. 
---
They need to hit the Galakrond Package. Elementalist is a stupidly powerful card that should have been in Priest. Making two 5/6 wolves with taunt for only 5 mana, come on... Even Galakrond himself is too powerful. Like the AVGN always say : What were they thinking? I'd nerf the wolves to 3/4s, bump the mana cost of the Elementalist to 6 and make the HP of Galakrond summon 1/1 rush minions... 
---
As for Priest, someone said to make it to discover a card which would make it already way better. I'd even go with Discover a minion. And since the cards in this expansion are so powerful except all the Priest cards, I don't see why Chronobreaker couldn't have Taunt.
---
Just anything but Priest minions would be a huge buff. Neutrals, minions from other classes, spells.
---
We really don't need a neutral Oasis Surger. When/if dragons do come to dominate, there's still Dragonmaw Poacher.
---
https://i.imgur.com/dHRCoHy.gif
---
Because the playerbase didn't design the cards....?
---
Losing sucks. Losing to the same deck multiple times uber-sucks. Blizzard doesn't give players enough tools to carve their own path. Ideally, there would be an emergency pressure valve for every possible deck in the meta, so that any deck that becomes too strong always has a natural release and can never overtake the meta. We got Dragonmaw Poacher, but we didn't get "Invoker Poacher". So of course we have to pressure Blizzard, because they're the ones with a hand on the valve. 
---
And yes, I realize that "draw this card or lose" feels bad in its own way and it isn't a perfect solution, but at least we wouldn't be where we are now, where we have to pressure Blizzard every so often to make the game more playable.
---
why so salty lmao, are you on your period or something? it's just a game forum bro
---
There's a meme I haven't heard in a while. Nice!
---
Me coming back from the bars at 3:00am
---
Yeah, any online game is going to attract assholes, doubly so if it's competitive, and they become more common the more popular the game is. I've stopped playing League of Legends almost entirely because of the community.
---
Bliz tried to minimize toxicity by only letting players use a short list of emotes, then took one away because of the BM, just to have the community use the Greetings emote for BM instead. The ability to report players that aren't on your friends list (a feature in nearly every popular online game) was added because plenty of people would be toxic then unfriend you so they could be an asshole with no consequences. In another top thread right now there are people saying "I deliberately rope each turn against Shamans", something that would get players in other card games penalized, just because someone is using the tools that Bliz deliberately designed and distributed.
---
"People were a mistake" - Hayao Miyazaki
---
I had the scorchers in a variation of the deck but this combo was so useful i replaced them. The reclaimers are also a decent 3 drop and i had so many 5 drops in the other version.
---
Yeah and they've gotten 2 swings in with it by that point, and you're playing a zero tempo card that doesn't effect the board in anyway. Thats not a game winning play imo.
---
I agree and let the mage quest also discover the spell instead of giving a random one, to at least make it somehow playable
---
I tried restarting the game but same thing happens. Anyone experiencing this issues?
---
Winning is fun, so don't blame other people for having fun. This is a game, that people spend a lot of time and/or money in and it's not the player's job to please the developers, but the other way around.

Looking to trade 80g quests. I'll show my quest, you go first. 🤝
---
Thanks - totally missed this!
---
Sure, it's super tricky to play. Ideally you have to count cards (especially clears) but yeah it's easy to make a mistake...
---
They  should rework warlocks galakrond.
---
Glad they're doing something.  I guess basically I just wait a while longer before deciding what my deck will be this season or crafting anything.
---
Well it shows you don't have enough dust you only have 80 and it costs 100
---
&gt; it's just a slightly worse Oasis Surger if you're behind on board.
---
"Just" a slightly worse version of a card that is one of the feature highlights of a deck *when its Quest is completed?*
---
I don't think you're making a good case against nerfing Faceless Corruptor.
---
Also, you can nerf one or two Shaman cards like Corrupt Elementalist or Dragon's Pack on top of Faceless Corruptor, you know.
---
I think it could go to 7 honestly. Like with lackeys around its stupid easy to have a 1/1 on the board and getting +4/3 and a 5/4 with rush is basically as good as bonemare which was nerfed from 7 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
It's not a huge nerf but it does reduce the chance of getting Bagurgle/poisonous early on which is p good
---
Murlocs in battlegrounds already have so much insane shit early on lmao I'm happy about this change tbh
---
So THIS is what they mean by 'Sleeper OP'
---
That's not going to stop people from complaining.
---
Because the player base are customers and community as customers r entitled to complain if they arent getting their full value on enjoyment for paying regularly.  
---
Applies to every game
---
*laughs in shudderwock*
---
Wow yikes on my part....jeez
---
\&gt;  So basically this expansion added one neutral card, Faceless Corrupter, and a few aggro Shaman/Warrior cards. Both decks, conveniently enough, do like 20+ damage to your face with only weapons/lifedrinker so they're extra interactive. 
---
What you're saying makes sense, but is insane... Throughout the reveals, we were mesmerized by the strength of new cards, crying about powercreep for cards such as Big Ol Whelp, platebreaker, frizz kindleroost, the explorers, the breaths, the aspects... all to be overshadowed by shaman with 4 new cards.
---
I summon blood of the ancient one.
---
He has Shuderwock or what's his face and you still lose, happended to me 5 mins ago.
---
Imo the hypothetical Hearthstone PTR would be more like d3's ptr where it runs for a week every season (which depending on dev needs ranges from around 3-4 months). Overwatch can afford to have a continuous PTR because there is no gameplay element to be gained from grinding over time (like packs or gear). So I think a week every few months would more than suffice to keep things balanced. I mean it took less than 24 hours for gala shaman to emerge as a stupidly OP deck this expansion, so even in the cases where the best deck of the expansion doesn't have as much of a gap between it and other decks, they would still most likely get caught before patch went live, giving blizz time to nerf cards as needed before we wind up with a deck that outside of mirror matches has an almost 70% winrate.
---
He's not talking about dragons. He is talking about the Shaman 5/6 Spirit Wolves from **Dragon's Pack**.
---
Yeah just denigrate all women why don't ya? Maybe you can imply I'm of some inferior ethnicity next? I mean we got sexism why not go racism next?
---
Its okay i proved my worth
---
It’s too late for me. Every expansion I tell myself I am going to wait but then I hit it day one to craft that sweet Dragon Queen Alexstraza/Zephrys/Zilliax/etc...
---
well if you steal it, they wouldn’t have a chance to destroy it and get it back with that one guy that equips a random destroyed weapon
---
Yea around rank 17-16 it starts becoming Shamanstone
---
Well, let's see.  Within the first five minutes of cards going live, there have been 10x as many (if not more) games played than the devs could ever play in testing.  They could specifically test it a lot and the numbers not look so bad in comparison to what they're testing themselves.  It could also be that they expected it to be a different deck variant than what we're seeing, so didn't have the data.
---
It's not like they're incompetent, it's just that they get so much more data in a few minutes on the live server than they could ever get internally.
---
I think it's more related to the numbers. Galakrond Shaman has like a 65% winrate, and that include the mirror which makes it lean toward the 50%... So this means it has probably 70%+ winrate against every other deck it faces... Usually, it settles after a couple of days but in this case, it keeps going up. The internal data probably shows this. 
---
I'm thinking they knew it was powerful and were ready to tone it down quickly, but wanted to see if the players would find a counter. As of this hour, players are joining the mass instead of finding a counter...
---
lmaoooo, okay white knight.
---
1. I didn't know if i needed the NSFW tag 
---
2. I hate just seeing all of the shaman bashing stuff so i had to make a meme before the nerf
---
This new rendition of pirate warrior isnt nearly as good as the old one. Watch one of Dane's newer videos. He actually says that his opponent's pirate deck is complete trash, since its just a standard one.
---
okay bigoted asshole.
---
&gt; Honestly, I am totally fine with them releasing overtuned cards if they are ready to do quick adjustments in the first weeks of the expansion
---
yeah it's annoying how many cool cards they added, that were just too weak to be played. for example freeze shaman could've been a thing, if moorabi wasnt a 6 mana 4/4. moorabi was a really weak payoff for making a deck, that had some below average cards in it.
---
adding stronger cards and nerfing them if necessary (especially for classes that have really bad playrates/winrates) would be great.
---
My deck is called Galaaarrrrrkrond
---
Priest is my most played class and I agree with some of that. Inner fire needs to be hall of famed along with divine spirit as those decks are just boring to play with and against. I can't remember a tier 1 deck that didn't have those two.
---
Also, the options button now obstructs the Wild / Standard toggle button
---
What’s the budget version? Not gunna build a deck that will get nerfed, but may do it if there’s a budget version floating around
---
It’ll realistically be a 2/2 weapon when you take it, but at least you can clear a Pirate with it right away
---
Oh yeah.
---
Granted, that's still an on rate one drop that cycles itself while the Elementalist is a heavily understatted five drop by itself.
---
I disagree, but to each their own.
---
Correct!  Stop buying packs with money!
---
Won't lie I did go a bit harsh, but considering the sexist shit he decided to say next, I feel rather justified.
---
Yeah im expecting something like mogu up 1 Mana, elementalist down 1 Mana but invokes once, dragons pack up 1 Mana, faceless corruptor up 2 Mana, sludge alurper down 1 attack. I expect shaman to be hit by a bunch of nerfs all focused on the speed they can contest the board so their matchups against any aggressive deck go further down. Then they'll probably drop slower things like far sight and Mana tide to play things like sandstorm elemental again and some other cards that'll help the early game maybe ooze if lots of pirates. Then barista shudder and galakrond will still outvalue a lot of slower decks. It'll be a lot weaker than it was and have less discrepancy against it's good matchups and actually have bad matchups but it'll probably still be a top tier value deck. That's gonna be my prediction at least.
---
I also think that galakrond shaman will get better to counter the counters you mentioned. Data backs that up, with class winrates day-by-day showing that other classes are just getting weaker. Its just undeniable that the power level of shaman cards and their synergies is so above and beyond. Team 5 announced balance changes as well (fastest ever). I get that this sub gets crazy at times, but that doesnt mean it should be completely rejected
---
WE LIVE TO BATTLECRY ANOTHER DAY
---
Any time they nerf a card it kills it.
---
So it goes. I guess I considered anything that wasn't druid or cubelock amiable at the time
---
Now we can buy wild packs with gold. What a convenient time to fix it,  don't you think?
---
Galakrond. A hero card they give to everyone for free.
---
It powers up by playing cards that invoke, a new keyword.
---
So, the complaint is basically, you make a shaman deck. Search invoke, put all the cards in. Fill in the gaps with other cards that are just strong. And then you win, a lot.
---
Sure there are choices to be made, but it only took about a day for people to find a list that beats every other archetype out there.
---
full dust for galakron the shaman hero pog everybody gets 1600 dust. Wait hummm.
---
Battlecry: Gain Rush.
---
Problem solved.
---
This is a new world record for the Team 5 giving a balance change to a totally digital card collection that they can balance anytime they test a patch and prepare it for deployment.
---
It's "meh" in wild.  It's garbage in standard.  
---
It's not good in either format.  Otherwise just throw in a vanilla 8/8 and be done with it.  For the most part in wild it is too slow vs aggro and not strong enough vs control to matter.  For example while it's great vs Zul'jin hunter and can sometimes be useful vs Jade druid, it's completely useless vs Shudderwok  and barely serviceable vs big priest.  It also happens to be bad in a big priest deck since you never want to pull it from barnes / cloning gallery since its only value comes from its battlecry.
---
Also yes I have played the deathrattle mill Toggwaggle deck where you use Murozond in a similar fashion as Azalina Soulthief and I still stand by my assessment that it's "meh".
---
*cough*roguequest*cough*
---
I played arena after a 1 and a half year break from the game and choose priest because it was one of the best classes in arena got 1 win and 3 losses
---
It really isn't ever 4/10 in stats though. You have to transform a minion, which realistically at worst is a 1/1. 6 mana 3/9 rush? Probably doesn't see much if any play.
---
Fastest balance changes after an expansion release EVER. Get rekt, scrub
---
Pee on her to assert dominance
---
I'm Kautilya and already your friend :) Ping me when you're online.
---
I know you probably don't wanna hear it, but if you're F2P or even low spending player, you'll have much better time in Wild. I understand Standard is more appealing for most, but I think investing into Wild collection and being able to play most of what you want after a while is miles better than playing a single non-budget Standard deck every expansion and then dust your cards for quarter value every year.
---
Not exactly related to this, but didn't Blizzard put something in place that would prevent you from getting a legendary you already have?  I got Octosari in a pack that I got for completing a quest.  I have every legendary in Uldum, so why did I get this.  I got the standard version and not a gold, and the one I already owned was standard.
---
Hey man you're right I misspoke with my comment.  Appreciate the heads up, I hope my point still comes across though that to say it's about both karma and visibility is essentially one in the same.
---
IIRC that change was aimed at wild, where even shaman was oppressive for a hot sec.
---
In Magic the card pool is not divided up into classes, but just needs you to sort out the mana base. This means that every deck has far more cards to potentially use, and someone building one that the balance team might not have thought about or really hit upon the best version of is not that crazy. The numbers are really not on their side. 
---
Hearthstone is more like having to balance every colour of mana individually without worrying about mixing. 
---
And then putting a deckrecipe IN THE GAME as a suggestion that already has more than half of the cards in it that ended up in the souped up ladder version.
---
A 5/4 with rush is worth 4 mana with a conditional. (Scaleworm) not 6 by any means
---
I think Galakrond Control warrior will become the replacement, not pirate. Dragon Druid also has a shot.
---
Even when playing Galakrond Shaman, Galakrond Warrior thoroughly destroys me. The deck looks fun as fuck to play, too. You literally faceroll a bunch of minions and then draw a 7/6 Zilliax.
---
This is a good point actually, I didn't think of those invoke cards. Changing it to discover priest card as opposed to minion might stop it being too strong don't you think?
---
&gt; Weapon destruction meta?
---
never has there been such a thing. it's not worth it to go hard on weapon destruction. even with kobolds and catacombs, where every class got weapons (with some being stupidly strong), it didnt work.
---
First, it's the last expansion of the year, and each class now can choose the best from 330 cards, and that certainly makes the dust costs go up. Second, Control decks have never been cheap and Aggro has always been a f2p player's choice. Third, nobody, except the people that have just started playing, crafts the deck from the ground up.
---
Shaman changes? Fucc why? Can't them be Kings for a while? I can see the 2/1 becoming a 1/1, or losing rush, some garbage like that. Quest shaman pretty much works up to 9mana when you switch to Galakrond but then, to complete quest up to that point you need like 5-6 turns. Unless you purposely delay your Galakrond play, you're just regular quest shaman, which was fine before. What's the difference now? The spawning of 2/1 with rush? Or that you invoke Galakrond too fast with quest? You could have used the 1/1 that doubles battlecry with the 3/3 that involves twice and get the same. If something Warlock Galakrond summons more stuff that is consistently 2/1, and after going very aggressive, you can refill hand with the 5/4 that draws 3.
---
unfortunately, people like myself who have only been playing since April don't have the backlog of classics and other expansions so there is a constant need for dust in order to craft anything which is why that button gets pressed constantly
---
Whatever asshole. Balance matters at all ranks
---
I'm inclined to believe this actually.
---
:'D
---
Good one.
---
I mean it's still pretty good, turns your lackey into 3 damage.
---
I have been stuck on this screen for nearly 4 hours now....
---
iPhone 8XS 
---
Anyone has had this issue before?
---
Definitely the correct move in bumping Primalfin Lookout to T5.
---
Ironically this isnt totally unreasonable. Rogue is the only class where they even pretend to give a shit about class identity (Shaman is supposed to be weak at card generation, so it gets EVIL Totem, the best card generation card. Warrior is supposed to be weak at drawing cards and flooding the board, so lets make Galakrond decks great at doing both).
---
Odd Shaman buff :(
---
Nah, that would be a pretty garbage card.
---
As it stands right now, without a LOT of pressure on the Shaman you have to clear the board about 4 times, between Galakrond, Shudder, Electra Stormsurge+Dragon’s Pack, and some combination between your last dragon pack and faceless corrupters. However, I think that the main problem is the 2/1 rushes for invoke. Probably more specifically, the guy that invokes twice. But I can’t think of any way to effectively nerf that without murdering the deck, so I’m thinking that maybe dropping the wolves from Dragon’s Pack from 5/6 to 4/5 might be enough.
---
but it could be a fun gamble. hit the button and craft as many duplicates as you can of specific cards, that you think might get nerfed. it's a win-win situation. doesnt matter if you win or lose, you get all the reddit karma
---
I did that against res Priest some weeks ago. The matches were really boring and I prefered to insta concede
---

Sigh, I have to hope Flik turns out to be OP enough to warrant a nerf.  I wanted to make a deck with him and I was browsing through my collection with the 'Crafting' menu open when I come across Flik, uncrafted in the bottom-right most slot of the screen.  So I craft him only to realize that I had a GOLDEN Flik on the next page.
---
TL/DR; I have both a golden and a non-golden Flik because I'm an idiot.  My only hope is that they nerf him and offer dust refunds.
---
It was a lucky streak, but I'm 12/16 VS Shaman.
---
0/3 against zoolock. Just to be clear.
---
I almost seem to beat it with my version of dragon Highlander hunter. This version of pirate warrior is worse than the means streets version.
---
Im playing greedy control decks so thats probably why the extra value gets me cause i cant exploit its weaknesses in the early game well.
---
What decks do you have that beat both Galakrond Shaman and Pirate Warrior? I get demolished by Shaman no matter what I play.
---
I'm betting it'll be all the way to 7.
---
Yeah the corrupt elementalist problem is really noticeable in my priest galakrond deck. It's so difficult to upgrade the guy even one time much less twice.
---
That's way too harsh a nerf. Hoenstly just removing Rush would be a decent way to start.
---
Have you forgotten the past couple months before DoD release?
---
I like this way more than a Mana nerf. Becomes a 5 Mana 3/3 give a minion +2/+2. Thus, the card is a 5/5 with rush.
---
Also, change the wording to another Faceless Corruptor so that Shudderwock doesn't go infinite
---
Making it only good when handbuffed is basically sending the card to the dumpster.  Personally, I'd remove the rush.  It would still add a bunch of stats to the board for its mana cost when used on a token, but without the massive tempo swing that rush gives.
---
It won’t, they tested this version and it was horrible.(random priest spells are actually worse then random priest minions)
---
Do you have the starter quest chain completed?
---
It's a shared pool. If everybody beelines for murlocs, nobody will get their murlocs.
---
You may not always get a game-winning team, but with careful planning, you can always cobble together a top-4 team.
---
Like running away from a hungry bear, you don't have to be the fastest, just be better than 4 others.
---
It's a good idea, so it probably won't happen. Team 5 can't seem to let go of their broken mana-cheating mechanics in one form or another.
---
It's hardly acting fast, Shaman has been an issue for a couple months now. They only care about it more now because it's affecting the new expansion.
---
Its so sad that bwonsamdi+spirit spent its entire time in meta as a garbage package.  This meta is cancer atm, but Rastakan was a wet fart.
---
I doubt people will run the weapon thief, and even if they do, upgrade and Greenskin are too much value to be cut from Pirate Warrior decks.
---
Dang it I didn't even think of this after a year of playing. You sir are a genius and I will be following this advice forever in the future.
---
It's possible that quest shamen does better against this guys deck but worse against the spread, its not as set in stone as your making it out to be.
---
A 5 mana 3/3 rush that gives you another one is still good
---
Battlegrounds is still currently in Beta, so there are more people looking at it, tuning it and fixing it than will be when it is officially live.
---
It was never meta, but that brief period of kragwa + unstable evolve was awesome.
---
Yeah, we should have Purify nerfed!
---
Battlecry Shaman with Zola/Barrista and i got a Crusty the Crustacean treasure which i stacked :)
---
The weapon would probably be a 2/1 unless it was hit with Upgrade or Greenskin, and although that is a small amount of tempo, a 4/4 on T5 with no Rush or Taunt doesn't affect the board in a meaningful way vs an aggro deck.
---
I have a theory that it's super and that people aren't good at it, but I'll wait for more data and some pro scenes to be sure
---
Honestly dude your points are very invalid, you can’t just say “just use a board clear” not many classes run 3+ heavy board clears, and they have to have them in hand aswell. It’s extremely powerful. Nobody can deny that, that is why there is an astronomical amount of people complaining about it. And if the team had to act this quick than it is a problem. Nothing you say will deflect that.
---
Bwomsandi and Spirit were actually doomed when, before Reckless Experimenter's release in the Boomsday expansion, Experimenter was changed before release to "end of turn."
---
Bwomsandi and Spirit had a chance of being good, but this change to Reckless Experimenter doomed the spirit package.
---
Yep
---
Only issue I see is where to display the altered cost. When you hover over a minion, the large card you see is supposed to be the card in its original unbuffed state. Displaying the modification there would obscure the original cost and be inconsistent with how the other two stats are depicted.
---
What are some fun, yet viable wild Priest decks? I may be interested.
---
I had a pack with 3 legendaries and 2 epics last year.
---
Which sounds good in practice until you've had a couple to drink...and then you just throw all caution to the wind
---
(king of the goons)
---
Thank you! Made me not want to play.
---
This is really bad advice for this xpac at least, I always dust everything but Im holding on all duplicates from DoD.
---
Wait, when?
---
It's entirely Blizzard's fault so introducing such a design limting quest with Corrupt the Waters.
---
What exactly did I do that freaked you out?
---
I definitely will, it looks like it has some fun new cards designed with handlock in mind.  Just missing that great 8 drop dragon
---
BOOMER HERE!
---
I hope this also includes buffing Priest
---
Wowowow nice!
---
Priest galakrond power does literally nothing in comparison to every other one. For invoke to be good and viable something needs to happen on board at the same time you play it
---
wait am i missing something? doesnt that button only disenchant extra cards?
---
A few years ago I rocked the most ridiculous Dragon, Tree of Life, Molten Giant Ramp druid and I loved every goddamn minute playing that deck.
---
Why does it look like shrek pissing all over the screen
---
I am all in.
---
Priest is an even more swingy class to be fair. Warrior is up there too.
---
It's OK Anduin, we still have wild right?
---
oh yea the nerfs, i forgot about it
---
At least this is a fast response after the expansion, we didn't get that previously
---
Finally!
---
I was thinking the same thing.  Discover a priest card would make Galakrond playable. I’ve found more success switching back to quest priest (still a low win rate, basically 0 against shaman) because the current add a random priest minion to your hand is trash most of the time
---
Warrior has amazing control cards in its core set, so they can always get by playing Control at tier 1 or 2.  Brawl, Shield Slam, Shield Block, etc.
---
On the contrary, Shaman and Priest have weaker Core cards and identity.  Priest "heal your hero" and Shaman "decent overloads" is not a good Core set.  Consequently these classes are constantly defined by the latest expansion releases rather than their Core set which makes them very swingy.
---
r/wallstreetbets
---
I think this card is fine if you just take away 1 health. In my experience, it’s too good because they trade into 3 attack minions and stay on board, and 3 attack minions are extremely common in the mid game where Faceless Corruptor really shines.
---
“They’re weak because they are missing a fundamental part of competitive deck building and gameplay”
---
Yeah... That’s not a good justification my dude.
---
Minions buffed with the +1/+1 card and mistcaller, but my flametongue totem only buffed my fire ele and not my spell totem. Really confused, panicked and ran my fire ele into the freezing trap and lost
---
you forgot the power of friendship yo
---
This isn't a deck people need tips for, it kinda plays itself. +rank 10 isn't really an achievement you can get there with pretty much any deck fairly easily.
---
&gt;Maybe its the decks I'm playing as but I can handle the non quest version pretty well.
---
Yup, that’s definitely a blatant disagreement on the facts of win percentage, a total objective statement about the total spread of matchups.
---
You do realise those decks are only good because they can beat galakrond shaman
---
They need to help priest put, this is just pathetic. Fkn team 5
---
This is not true, they still get destroyed.
---
Vanilla. Shaman was pretty rubbish except against the Handlocks.
---
Guys sorry but you really dont know what you re doing. You just released the most OP set in Hs history (maybe Koft can compare to it) and started the nerfs on day 3? LOL. 
---
Just wait 2 weeks to see how this goes and then start the balancing. **Or maybe even better balance it before release. It s not like Galakrond shaman was some kind of hidden deck, it was 100% obvious. So where the f\*\*\* is your playtesting?**
---
Perhaps they just shouldn't be making sets two releases away? If the argument is that they need that time for balancing, clearly that isn't working and they just end up balancing classes for a meta that no longer exists by the time the adjustments come through via new releases.
---
Considering that maybe 1/4 of the new cards any given set use new mechanics at all and a lot of the art is used from WoW, I'm hard pressed to believe that it takes 6 months to make a full new set
---
4 mana 77
---
We're only what, three days into the expansion? The meta isn't set in stone, people will figure out counters eventually
---
I think the only difference should be overload (2) on it, fits with shaman archetype and prevents dragons pack from being played if going on curve..
---
It's not about my time.
---
 It's about sending a message. /joker meme
---
Those took years technically
---
Nah, so I can friend and curse people who beat me in ranked
---
deal
---
No zephyr kazakus lord godfrey voidlord taunt army DK guldan and twisting nether would. Also Slyvannas is used ik the deck with Nzoth too
---
Uhhhhh no. Very easy with Shaman tho!
---
Hello! I'm trading my 80g quest. I'll show it but you go 1st. :)
---
EU KitrenSlayer#21908
---
Wait, what's the interaction with frizz/embiggen and holy wrath?
---
He probably used [[Fate Weaver]] to set up an OTK, involving Prophet Velen, [[Vidid Nightmare's]] and really any damage spell.
---
Priest got the short end of the galakrond stick
---
Shaman before Whispers or maybe even Karazhan was a joke class
---
“Get divine shield on poison minions, gg”
---
Chris next expansion nerf cards after reveal and pre-release and give people dust while opening the packs :P
---
It actually makes more sense to me from what im seeing.
---
Good luck with the shamans
---
how about they keep rush, hut upgrading changes the amount summoned, not their stats?
---
Would be cool when it comes out next week then, I guess.
---
Yes, that's the point. You are not supposed to be buying older packs. It should not be "correct" to buy older packs for the purposes of dusting the cards. You should be buying cards in Standard.
---
It's the weakest Galakrond. That is what we were talking about. 2 1/1s and four random, read useless, demons.
---
Good job!
---
It consistently puts out more stats on board earlier than most other decks out there. For me it has been harder to beat than Shaman with evolve, and that was bad enough. My only consistent counter is Mage. The nerfs are needed so more classes can be played, than the few that can counter it.
---
Or right after a nut, when half your piss stream thinks ~~the wall~~ ~~floor~~ ~~nearby plunger~~ anything but the toilet bowl is the target
---
Veranus + Unleash is a 10 mana board clear, which seems fine for Hunter considering the class identity is supposed to lack AoE
---
It took me reading your comment to get this. Thank you my friend.
---
Yeah, not you specifically. It's just exhausting seeing people bitch and moan while I'm trying to get information. 
---
I'm here to discuss the meta, the game, and all that stuff, not to be bombarded by people calling each other retarded because they're playing the only deck that's worth playing at the time, or with a bunch of armchair game designers whinging about how they could do better.
---
I know "that's how the Internet works" and all that. I just wish we could have a few spaces on the Internet where we take a second to think about the things we say to other human beings, and Hearthstone was very much like that early on. 
---
 Rant over.
---
Nice
---
You’re quite special aren’t you mate?
---
what about mysterious challenger and secrets
---
Lmfaoooo
---
I’ve only been climbing with Rogue so far. Not an incredible win rate, but I’m chipping away at stars consistently.
---
Full 4 hours in your car? Were you waiting for something?
---
You telling me that Blizzard is reusing character designs!? That's a bold accusation!
---
Now excuse me, but I need to get ready for my MC raid tonight...
---
The format is never good. There's always at least one deck that can beat mine.
---
No Mage and Hunter has a higher winrate against Galakrond
---
I actually really like this idea.  It also gets rid of infinite shudderwock.
---
Play Experimenter and Juggler. Then, play Dead Ringer over and over until the Juggler pings your enemies to death.
---
Good metas usually have no tier 0 decks and a wide variety of t1/t2 decks.
---
How often does Breath of Dreams get it's extra effect in the early game? And is Frizz actually useful? I feel like with only four dragons in the deck, the chances of those going off are pretty low.
---
Patches shouldve just kep old voiceline,and gotten charge/rush as a battlecry so its not a way worse wisp when played;(though battllecry gain charge might be bit of issue with shudderwock but thats more shudderwocks fault then would be patches)
---
being positive on this is bullshit, game balancing is their job and fixing it shouldn't be worthy of praise.
---
The cards are collectible like in the old adventures-naxx, League of Explorers and One Night in Karazhan, you can use them in play mode and see them in your collection.
---
Iksar has stated how much he loves the keyword, yet I honestly fear that he doesn't quite understand how strong it is. 
---
This is the first set where Rush cards are being printed without a stat penalty and some of them are honestly so broken you have to wonder how they ever got past testing.
---
Anyone remember the 1 mana 1/3 Weapon that gained +2 attack if you had spell power on the board? Which very often shaman did in the early game but was still a great draw late game?
---
im gonna watch this asap
---
Same thing happens with Priest hero power, which is just swap the attack and health of a minion
---
maybe make it a shaman card, though then it a class card so make it cost 4 and maybe raise the stats a bit maybe 7/7?
---
I think they're speaking from a rank 10-20 experience, where half the meta deck you play is replaced with tech cards.
---
Seems like your deck is a bit too greedy.
---
But what the hell is the t2 decks that beat it?
---
I don't think Shudderwock is an issue. Decks are allowed to have late game power spikes
---
Lol, sux. Report it.
---
I have an 80% wr, but that’s only over like 15 games, so not much to go off of. I just figured the deck should be t1-t2 since several of those games I won turn 4.
---
&gt; Bob would never make a player lose
---
I'm gonna go ahead and call bullshit, because offering someone Wrath Weavers and Mecharoos on turn 1 is precisely that. He knows what he's doing.
---
The deck code bot [strikes again](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/ea8jgf/mindflayer_kaahrj_grave_rune/faom0bo?context=3). The bots on this sub are great.
---
i so wish we had gotten a rastakhans rumble buff patch(buffs should happen lot more in general but still).
---
From a relatively new player's perspective it's not so much that we're shitting on them for the expansion but more along the lines of how they went about it. 
---
Ever since they've been releasing cards, streamers and well known contributors have basically said "Yo Blizzard this is broken, objectively broken" and Blizzard was like "nuh uh".... 
---
I mean like c'mon, their design team is composed of maybe a couple hundred people (being extremely generous here) and there's literally hundreds of thousands of people who provide input and for them to say "Nah all of y'all are wrong" is absolutely preposterous.
---
I’ve played cyclone mage from 17 to 15 this morning. Beat a few tree druids and even a couple shaman. It’s a really fun deck for me. I spend a lot of turns waiting and taking damage and then I get to swing the game when I get my combo pieces. I like it a lot
---
The whole game is cancer, so stop complain.

Faceless is not a “slightly worse” Bonemare. They’re both busted, sure. But they’re completely different cards that play very differently in practice. 
---
Bonemare was so strong because you could just slap it onto any minion no matter how big or small and continue to smorc with them. It was a *super* aggressive card. 
---
Meanwhile Faceless benefits most from being played onto small or heavily damaged minions, and you can’t go face with it immediately. Faceless is still a busted card when you’re playing for the board, even more so than Bonemare was.

Faceless would not see play at 7 mana in my opinion.

---
That isn't just 6/5/4, tho? You forgot about the battlecry?
---
He’s literally in the hidden gutter ELO for me.
---
Faceless Corruptor will sure suffer the nerf hammer.
---
I do believe that Shudder and Shammy quest will only trigger battlecries from minions. Those lots of 8/8 with rush is kinda crazy too
---
still has more board impact than rogue and priest, shaman would also still have the best invoke cards, synergies and payoff.

That's true! I was able to do that vs a priest who ran Plague.
---
Oh
---
It’s just a worse version of the deck though, there’s no reason not to play non-quest if it’s just superior.
---
you could also try beeing a decent human beeing
---
Waxadred/Stowaway Rogue is actually really good. I find often times it's better to Shadow of Death something other than Wax like Zilliax, Faceless Corruptor, a Khartut Defender, or a beefy taunt the oponent has like you did here. Something that makes an immediate impact on the board.
---
Not to say Wax isn't a fantastic card and core part of the deck (You need its aggressive statline to close out a lot of games. I just personally accrue Waxadreds naturally through apothecaries, Elekk's and whatnot. And won't rush to Shadow of Death it. Unless I'm playing an opponent who's putting no pressure on me whatsoever.
---
Has anyone noticed there's not shaman in Battlegrounds?
---
 It's because they are afraid of Bob!
---
Shhh. Shaman is not allowed to have anything
---
you've seen hagatha? i don't believe you sorry
---
We are trying to nerf it not make it unplayable
---
Those decks performed in tier 1 and high tier 2. Stop trying to make excuses. You were wrong. That’s all that’s going on here. So either admit it or stop responding, because every time you do you’re just digging the hole deeper.
---
I probably will dude thank you, my wife I'm sure will be more than accommodating.
---
Sorry, didn't realize. Nerfed
---
The fact he thinks Ancharrr will be nerfed is laughable ngl
---
newsn't
---
Honestly, I thought galakrond rogue was kinda meh, until I got slapped in the face by a 32/32 questing adventurer...
---
Well other tier one decks that weren’t op didn’t consist of 98% of ladder. Not only that other tier 1 decks that have been unbalanced have been prime examples of this. When control warrior was so op people started playing reborn paladin to beat it.  Rightfully nerfed. When Reno mage was so op everyone started playing aggro to beat it. That’s not a healthy meta. A healthy meta is decks having strengths and weaknesses that benefit them in different scenarios against different decks. The fact that shaman beats pretty much everything unless you otk them is not healthy. The fact that the entire ladder is people playing one class is not healthy. And if you think everyone should run the same deck, or a deck that hard counters that deck is a healthy meta, I hope you never end up balancing hearthstone.
---
No
---
I’m glad. And the hearthstone community will be waiting for you too to accommodate fucking you in the ass once shaman gets nerfed

Oh yeah, this deck that [only really loses to Galakrond Shaman](https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/22/pirate-warrior#tab=matchups) is just gonna completely disappear once Galakrond Shaman is nerfed. That makes perfect sense.

Iksar had a tweet where he said they think Faceless is good, but not oppressive, so likely, it will not be nerfed.

The Rogue Galakrond has a pretty terrible played winrate. It definitely feels like the weakest of the 5. At least warrior can draw the dragon that turns into 3 7/6 minions with Rush. I think the Rogue Galakrond should only draw cards that cost 3 or more so it has a limit on how bad the draws can be.
---
It's already an 8/8 body for 8 mana. That's huge value when copying anything from the opponent. It would be too much to buff this in any way.
---
Nevermind,
---
Start of game: If your deck has no duplicates, for the rest of the game, at the end of your turn, restore 6 health to your hero. If your hero is at maximum health, at the end of your turn, use ALL your unspent mana and summon a random minion equal to its cost.
---
I mean, if your hero is at 29 hp and goes to 30 hp, you will NOT summon a minion equal to your unspent mana.
---
Could you share a deck code?
---
Pirate Warrior isn't good against Galakrond Shaman though. It's good against every deck other than Galakrond Shaman and goes even with Handlock.
---
Downvote all you want, sounds like you aren't playing good players lol
---
Because its annoying and people that actually did care have left like they said. Most didnt and are enjoying the game
---
So we're just gonna forget that this is the same guy who blocked a former Blizzard employee on social media after she rightfully called out Activision on the mass layoffs earlier this year?
---
I think there are way more options to beat Pirate Warrior than Shaman, not worried.
---
Dr. Boom sees 0 play in wild believe it or not. He might be too slow for standard too
---
Yes because u lose because of the animations. U literally dont have a turn.
---
I crafted a golden lucenbark, no regrets. 30% of the time it works everytime
---
Lunara and Sylvanas stared at each other long and hard on the battlefield. Their lovemaking had taken a drastic turn. There were some trees there, as well as a few dogs. Everything was getting very hot and steamy.
---
Zentimo walked in to see these horrid atricities being committed on his brand new carpet! He began violently vomiting all over.
---
P.s. I own all the cards and am enjoying the expansion with any of the classes lol. Shaman isn't even the most fun deck out of them all, it's a beast though!
---
It wouldn't shock me if thunder wave actually gets made due to how much they dickride shaman and are shit at balancing
---
The Shaman card is just Sandstorm elemental without overload and with rush. Seems exactly like the kind of broken card that Blizzard would give to their favorite class.
---
grandpa, this card is useless, why did you put it in your deck?
---
how?
---
Technically what we "needed" was for them to do their jobs in the playtest phase. Guess this better than nothing tho.
---
Because shaman really needed another invoke huh.
---
So they can invoke for a total of 16 times
---
&gt;Galakrond: stats of the elemental will be reduced. Being a free legendary, Blizzard will gift all the players 1600 dust
---
But Galakrond cards are uncraftable and can't be disenchanted
---
Just been playing a homebrew deathrattle hunter and i do pretty well against both shaman and warrior and been climbing ladder just fine. Hasnt been bad unless i try to actually play a slower deck.
---
This card in arena is literally an instant win if you have the board. Who the fuck thought this was a balanced card
---
Give priest Invokes +1/+1. It's not game breaking, and would prevent \[Test Subject\] from being a dead card.
---
When I first started and never even thought twice about strategy or looking at reddit for advice I crafted hogger because it “seemed” good. Haven’t used him in 3+ years lol
---
shudder doesn't play spells/summon the minions though. Well, usually at least.
---
Yes it is :D
---
god yes
---
Pretty sure this combo no longer works due to Reckless Experimenter nerf.
---
I’ve been woooshed!
---
How do you beat it as a  Galakrond Shaman ?  hope they misplay? 
---
The only thing I can figure out is don't get damaged and don't overplay a board that can be removed.  I can't figure out a good tec card either.
---
Mage has no Galokrond. Bite me.  
---
I'm salty we get no love expac after expac.
---
luck, good deck and a good draw
---
I really doubt people are interested in Standard and Wild becoming almost indistinguishable.
---
So original. Not like anyone has said this before, or even once a year since GvG came out. Take your much deserved karma and proceed to more worthwhile posts that offer so much that we haven’t talked about before.
---
can remove shudderwock from the game any time now...
---
I really did try to win, I promise! It seems a little ridiculous he got this board by 5 mana, maybe the game is a bit broken right now.
---
When you see a lot of GM players not wanting to play ladder because it’s pretty much all shamans, there’s clearly a problem and Blizz knows they need to fix it ASAP...
---
It’s quite easy. If you know the percentage of the spawning of each card rarity. Multiply them to each other and there you have it. The chance of this pack
---
I don't think the double invoke is bad if they the storms are 1/1s. It's 5/5 stats for 5 mana, that's perfectly fine to me.
---
I choose ~~death~~ battlegrounds!
---
I agree with you - I am a huge arena fan as well and I applaud the quick action on Poacher, but the missing leaderboards is baffling to me. They already have the code written to create the leaderboard. All they need to do is copy/paste the SQL query (or whatever it is), change the start/end date, run query, copy paste to a blog, hit publish. That is a 5 minute process and would be incredibly easy to automate. I don't know why it takes more than a day after a season ends, let alone six weeks or two+ months.
---
Obviously they are paying attention to arena (banning poacher extremely quickly shows this) and obviously they create tons of cards specifically for arena (maybe I am wrong but I don't think cards like blackwald pixie or hippogryph see much constructed play), so why can't we get leaderboards and class balance microadjustments quickly/at all?
---
I understand that arena isn't a huge direct moneymaker for the game, but this is something that costs almost nothing and gets a lot of people hyped up for the game mode and for Hearthstone in general. I know I would've quit years ago without Arena, and I would've quit 9 months ago if not for something like the leaderboards to keep me going, and I would not have recommended the game to so many of my friends. These give a lot of players something tangible to work for and get excited about.
---
Only fellow Deryl players will understand :P
---
If infinite wok matters you're playing too slow and greedy and deserve to lose. Shudderwock is a fun card and rotates next set anyway.
---
And payoff, per usual, will be here next December. And the payoff will be on par with Talanji.
---
I have had a lot of luck with a steal rogue that runs quest, gala, Tess, heist Barron, academic espionage, and a ton of draw.  You get board wipes from stolen spells and, blade fury.  I keep getting tons of dragons, the dragon that stuffs your deck with dragons, shudder, and kalecgos
---
*laughs in golden galakrond*
---
though I'll most likely still keep it.
---
\+1  
---
You can't have public PTR's but you can definitely have private ones with limited invites and NDA's. The most popular players are going to want to keep things to themselves while they learn, and you get their knowledge too. I HIGHLY agree that whatever current process they have for testing is way too lengthy and cumbersome. Either Blizzard is waiting too long to try and make "data driven decisions" which fly in the face of what we're experiencing on a daily basis, or the process of which to have nerfs approved, tested, and deployed to devices is too cumbersome and needs much more streamlining or automation.  
---
Sincerely, someone that hires automation engineers and technical program managers for a living - the very people that are supposed to manage this type of shit, just in a different domain.
---
Thanks. I missed a few of those.
---
Would love to see this in Battlegrounds. u/mdonais any chance of this?
---
galakrond priest is only played cause it's new and cheap. Old rez priest and combo priest is way way better.
---
I would play a tavern brawl with only vanilla cards and. A couple of card drawn spells
---
Quest Hunter it's underrated 😒
---
Well I'm not sure how much advice I want to give out to most of my opposition, but creating threatening boards is key. If you make a board that takes up too much space and doesn't have much attack a good paladin player will punish you for it. They will let you do minor face damage for a few turns and just heal through it while cycling hard. 
---
The obvious things like take opportunities to overdraw them, even if it means having a weak turn (milling one key card will outright win you the game in most circumstances) and playing to win instead of not lose. That may mean playing hard into a second board clear. 
---
Most of the time we will not be able to deal more than 25 damage in one turn, and staying above 25 is obviously a good idea.
---
As for tech cards, the card that plays both players weakest card would work, the guy that sets you both to 5 mana might buy you the time to finish us off and a strong board clear would help deal with the 9 mana play a 5/5, three shirvallas and watch your opponent concede turn.

I ran embiggen and wild pyro in a similar list.  Couldn't get this deck to be consistent though. Suuuuper fun though.
