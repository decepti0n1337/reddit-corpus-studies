Low mana cost for spell damage, can enable some combos/wave clears, and draw you a card
---
---
---
Uproot or no balls.
---
Low mana cost means he can easily be played along with a spell to get the +damage, and most importantly the card draw means he doesn't cost a card and he can be played alone just to cycle a card.  Sometimes people play Kobold Geomancer for the cheap spell damage, sometimes people play Novice Engineer or Loot Hoarder for the card cycle.  Thanos is both of these in one.
---
CONGRATS, OP.
---

---
YOU MADE IT TO THE FRONT PAGE
---
If it makes you feel better, Kripp himself called Life Tap a terrible hero power when he first started.
---
You should take five seconds and use all of your reading comprehension and logical thought skills. What does doing something "twice" mean? It means to do something two times. One more time than once. What does "again" mean? It means one more time.  AKA: twice. The second time you do something, to re doing it twice and you're doing it again. They mean the exact same fucking thing. Neither card says who or what is casting the spell. It's just more lazy "streamlining" that makes things confusing, inconsistent or unintuitive. Which is a shame, because they just needed to use the word copy to make it clear. 
---
For someone so wrong, you sure are a cocky asshole about it.
---
From experience, I think Rogues perform better in Arena with a lot of 3 and 4 drops, and fewer 2. HP is a good enough 2 drop most games
---
Silence :/
---
Definitely Starving Buzzard when he was at 2 mana. Best boi in hunter

Everyone has a good game plan until you drop a 6/7 on the the board
---
I'm on a Warrior run with Melchezzar and lots of armor gain, and it's essentially a troll deck... With the extra cards, I've gone to fatigue and won that way three times in a 5-1 streak
---
It really wasn't seen that much after it was nerfed tbh, but yeah seeing play in 1 deck and not even a key card in it is not op
---
Why would it be a spoiler?
---
I thought mind control was so good i play only priest for my first months of hs
---
I'm curious how Zilliax stacks up in wild to and with Pioleted shredder.
---
I forgot I only play wild so I thought, "Priest is absolutely busted right now, what are you talking about?"
---
She predicted that you would use Fireball
---
Thanks!
---
Commander Rhyssa. She triggers all of your secrets twice.
---
Yeah that's not part of the basic set.
---
Healing is what makes Zilliax good, and autoinclude. Not rush.
---
Well, healing+rush+divine shield... Again a rush+divine shield wouldn't be autoinclude
---
Watching them on Twitch will give you a more ‚Äòhonest‚Äô view of the deck. YouTube is for wins and really weird decks that managed to beat them.
---
Nice! Not the greatest of combos, but it's a joy to win the warrior after 30 minutes.
---
Twilight drake used to gain +1 +1 for all cards in hand and that was unfair.
---
&gt;Dr. Boom / Conjurers Calling two cards that really should have also been looked at just to try and make the game more fun but no, all nerfs go to rogue. 
---
Hi, I've been playing a fuckton of Hand Mage lately
---
Conjurer's is a bit overestimated for two reasons:
---
- The pool of minion transformed is overestimated
---
- it's difficult to gain the proper early tempo unless you play Mountain Giant or Drake.
---
Really, the offender of Mage deck is Mountain Giant, not conjurer's calling
---
At least you got dust back for ragnaros.
---
Still OP with spiteful warrior
---
TBH I don‚Äôt have a strong opinion on this deck yet.  I‚Äôve played against it a few times and probably lost more than I won, but I also...haven‚Äôt considered them common enough to be worth teching against.
---
It‚Äôs not the first time Flamewaker has showed up in wild, and there‚Äôs definitely counters to it (Even Shaman soaks flamewaker procs very effectively).  The quest setting up an OTK with the giants is the new thing, and it does seem to be hard for some decks to beat.
---
Tempostorm‚Äôs latest meta snapshot lists it as bad against Jade Druid, Big Priest, Murloc Shaman, and Even Shaman, which means there‚Äôs a lot of ways to beat it in the format.  But yeah, warlock is bad against it, and that matches my experience too.
---
No prob! Good luck!!
---
So....do you agree with me or not? No implies you didnt but the rest of the sentence implies you do  :S
---
god you just reminded me of the good ol' mechmage meta days, just toss out an annoy-o-tron and let them suffer
---
Blessing of kings
---
if your opponents are **consistently** able to play a 2/4 on turn 5 and another 2 2/4s on turn 6 to setup for a combo like this without you being able to remove any of them maybe your deck could use some re-evaluating.
---
The 5/2 with stealth, I no longer longer remember it‚Äôs name
---
Hi if u like hunter that's the perfect class to get back into. There is also mech hunter. Both are fairly cheap and are both t2. If you are lf for deck lists u can wisp me, played both at top 1k legend so I think I can provide decent budget alternatives or just go for the full thing =)
---
Yeah I miss him too.
---
I don't think Tazdingo would have done what he did if he didn't know that you were gonna be here after he was gone.
---
&gt;There is just something so satisfying using divine spirit to double a minion's HP, inner fire and spamming constant heals on a super buffed minion while your opponent cant do anything but watch him slowly kill everything.
---
You will find fast decks that will wreck you in no time at lower ranks. That means you'll need stall tools and lots draw if you want to play combo :)
---
Anyway, there are some hidden "achievements" that will give you packs or gold.

Faceless manipulator. I hated that card with a passion. I remember having very few good cards and people either copied my good legendaries when i played them or ended up with 3 ragnaroses of their own.
---
Senjin shieldmasta lmao
---
Instructions unclear, I'm now stuck to the fridge.
---
That‚Äôs how I did it too - great card.
---
Zayle decks will stay the same until the year of the dragon is over.  Next year, the year of the raven rotates to wild and some of Zayle's cards are from the year of the raven sets, so the Zayle decks will change at the start of next rotation.

Reckless Rocketeer - 5 Mana 6/2 charge whaat?

Oh okay, thank you!
---
MrBigShot#1961 NA trading 80g. You go first
---
But if we compare the size of an ant vs a human we're like giant mech robots. Makes all the small things in life feel much bigger.
---
Like thinking about the energy we get from eating a meal vs the size of ants and how big our main control center is. It's a pretty buzzy world man.
---
Yeah it's a badly designed card from a theme point of view IMHO. It's a legendary that doesn't really do anything cool. He just boosts your spells a bit and helps you cycle. Only reason he's a legendary is he's be OP if you could run two.
---
Not helpful at all
---
Al'Akir is my all-time favorite card. All of my victories back then ended with Al'Akir + Rockbiter (or 2!)
---
Rogue can shadowstep it to make it 1 mana, then play it 4 times on turn 10
---
Inner fire, the priest attack health switcheroo card. I got wrecked by it at at rank 20 pre naxx lol. I was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù enough to see inner fire priest be a serious thing like twice after in the time since then.... 
---
guess i was right?
---
I'm always happy to meme.
---
Do you have a source?

The best way of making use of it is to dust it and create something useful. I'm pretty sure Splintergraft has never seen play in any deck that wins games.

Sure, dude.

Arcane missile,

I crafted "the mistcaller" within my first twee weeks of Hearthstone thinking it was an OP card and put it in all my shaman decks. Good times

In the opposite I instantly dusted my Harrison thinking it was awful
---
I imagine this plot existing in a fictional board game in a fictional universe is only as controversial as this plot existing in a digital card game in our universe, i.e., not very.
---
I played rafaam the turn before and my friend cleared the board after. I was reading through my cards to see if i can play any good cards when i read janalai: summon ragnaros if you dealt 8 damage with your hero power (deal two more damage). At first i skimmed through but then i noticed it said two damage left. 
---
I didnt realize it works even if you deal damage to yourself. So i tapped and summon janalai and ragnaros. 
---
Next turn i could also talanji. But he conceded that turn lol.
---
He's a fireball machine
---
Oh yeah it works like that and I think that‚Äôs hilarious and awesome. I love seeing weird interactions like that.

---
Imho Slay the spire is easy as hell. I could win every run, even when I'm unlucky. It's highly possible you can beat it with the first try.
---
Try "Card Quest" if you really want a challenge.
---
When I just started playing I found shaman‚Äôs hero power to be soooooo good, and I don‚Äôt remember why
---
I try that and then I don't draw it and die rip
---
This deck is probably better now. Just a wasted turn 1.
---
Sap is still super strong. The only reason rogue cuts saps is that they have so many other strong cards and that they even need sap a lot of the time because they are so strong on board.
---
Northshire cleric is also insane. It's the rest of Priest that sucks.
---
How did his opp play that much of a Snip Snaps? At 0:25 it looks like ~30 if counting the one that's dead. I can do max of 18 only. Is there some technique?
---
r/fuckpriest
---
Well, it is Khadgar's Wisdomball after all and we're the baddies. He's just earning our trust gradually only to stab us in the back when we don't expect it.
---
"Oh, hey, here's the additional card. It's shit, but I gave it to you. Oh wow, I can play it again for you, doesn't matter it's the fucking Coin, I helped. See, I'm such a friend to you, let me gain you an extra turn even though you're pretty much fucked anyways. Now that you trust me, let me FUCKING CAST A TWISTING NETHER ON YOUR TOP-DECKED BUFFED MUKLA, YOU MONSTER."
---
Well from the looks of things, it seems that this lad has the wild magic anomaly mode turned on, which recasts all spells at random targets. So the player probably had 0 costs andonzied grizzly and lich king. So playing the grizzly, then king, then banana splitting with king, then it hits lich king again, making it that freaking high.
---
Start heckling, at least it'll give the fridge taunt
---
No problem!
---
I forgot about Secret Hunter, which is really strong as well. Hunter is definitely the way to go right now if you ask me.
---
Happend to a guy i was watching on Twitch, you just repeat the encounter against another boss.
---
Vanish was interestingly barely played back then despite being considered insane now.
---
The biggest problems it had were that it didn't really fit into the Rogue archetypes back then that were usually some sort of miracle or face variant and that it was overshadowed by Bladeflurry until that got nerfed.
---
I guess the boards were also less sticky back then so the pseudo silence effect wasn't as valuable back then.
---
Jaraxxus was amazing against most decks but against priest it was easier to stall/board control with drakes/dump giants where necessary and then just draw out your deck for the combo. Jaraxxus was kinda just a good but not necessary card for the matchup.
---
Fiery. ~~War.~~ Win. Axe. For 2 mana. LOL
---
Pfft. You though dragons were real like magic and murlocs?
---
Ofcourse they're animatronic, silly.
---
&gt;1 / This card takes up 2 slots in your deck. So that mean 2 less slot for other cards. 
---
That is a good thing. Outside of a handful of decks out there, most would prefer to work with fewer cards if all of those cards are of high quality versus more cards of an on average lesser quality. Fewer cards also means a greater level of consistency.
---
Think of it this way: would you rather play a Burn Mage deck with fifteen of the best cards in Mage generally or one with forty-five where two-thirds of the deck is filler?
---
&gt;2 / This card throw away 2 of your cards from the deck. Using this card twice, will throw away 4 of your cards. Isn't that a bad thing? I understand that it's good to have option during the game, but at the same time, throwing away your card should not be taken lightly. 
---
Outside of low probability situations, you're throwing away the two lesser cards of the three shown, which improves the quality of future draw. If on turn five, I play Tracking and see two one drops and Savannah Highmane and choose the latter, I not only got my perfect turn six play but also increased my chances of seeing my other late game cards at the same time.
---
&gt;3 / Lastly, it's not like you will get the card you want when the options come up. It's random 3 cards, so you have to pray that 1 of those 3 cards is the card that you want. 
---
That can be said about all card draw, and when you're playing Hunter, the equivalent of MtG's Red-Green decks, you take all the card draw you can find.
---
&gt; 4 / The only benefit that I see is that you are now drawing 6 cards from the deck. In some cases that's good, in other cases it's not good. 
---
Yeah. When you're more or less playing a game of chance, sometimes you'll lose, but even in the worst case for tracking (say dropping it on turn seven and seeing three extremely low impact cards), you're still making the rest of your deck better for the remainder of the game. It was still a good play to make.
---
&gt;5 / You never want to play this card on turn #1 right? This card is reserved for after you know what kind of play style you will play for that round. 
---
If you have nothing better to play on turn one, you still might as well, especially if you already can tell what you're opponent is most likely playing based on their class alone. The earlier you can play a Tracking, the more of its deck filtering effects will be felt, but it is something you should rarely if ever prioritize playing over minions early on.
---
It is not a game breaking bug. Just a visual annoyance.
---
I picked him as the last treasure only because I knew I am 99% going to win anyway so it didn't matter what I pick. Never thought how easily he can be cleared, I thought that can't happen.
---
Ring a ring ring
---
Probably not the best shadowstep option in rogue, but interesting enough.
---
Also that the guy managed to squeeze a win out with AT LEAST 6 burlys, so he must have an abysmal curve, which is obviously less impressive than living through them and telling the tale. Just wow.
---
I lost to a mage because my popgos was at the bottom of my deck.
---
Usually matchups require certain cards or playstyle to beat the opponent reliably. Tracking allows you to find cards that you need. One example is playing against a tempo rogue. The game is always about controlling the board with trades. This means that you will be able to use tracking to get a spring paw or UTH and discard cards like KC (provided you are not threatening lethal). This is opposed to matchup against control warrior, where you will use tracking find cards that will burst him down or create insane tempo like zuljin and wyverns. One of the more underrated aspect is the discard, which means against a control warrior, you can discard UTH (the worst card in the deck against control) from your deck, so the chance of you drawing a better card in the matchup will be much higher.
---
Obviously wild is a lot cheaper. There are so many fantastic aggro decks that cost close to nothing, for example mech hunter, who has 5 pair of rare cards and the rest are common. Zilliax is not necessary in that deck. And you can have openings like this - https://hsreplay.net/replay/h3cUWdDoJGcsw6Y7Bbu7rZ which makes reaching rank 5 very easy and quick.
---

For me it was Flame Imp. I play a minion that does damage to myself???Why would anyone ever do that??......Tempo was a hard concept at first lol.
---
Was gonna say pyroblast, then remembered it's classic. So mind control. Still is OP.
---
To be fair, that thinking right now is reasonable haha. Back in the day he was okay
---
They want hero skins to be rare so that their percieved value is higher. So more people will buy them, because they're rare. The kicker is because they're for unpopular classes, they'll still be rare, even though many people bought them.
---
I'm not saying my logic is foolproof, it's just my conspiracy theory as to why I'm never gonna get a cool hunter skin.

---
That a bit too late for me but I'll start saving from now on.

I don‚Äôt get this because everything about this card suggests it‚Äôs strong. He looks intimidating as fuck, name is literally DEATH KNIGHT, 8/8 stats and lots of words so you know it‚Äôs gotta do something good.

Yep! Working on Heroic right now, I beat 1, 2 and 5, having trouble with 3 though.
---
DAE Stoneclaw Totem isn't a snek?!?!?
---
If by often you mean rarely in bad versions of the deck. There are better early game drops to stave off agro than Mecharoo and that don't ruin your late game dominance over control decks. Neither Mecharoo nor Sn1p are common enough to be listed as core inclusions and for good reason - they don't fit the gameplan of the deck at all.
---
Highmane
---
Oh those have great battl...oh
---
&gt; This deck is probably better now. Just a wasted turn 1.
---
Eh, quest is a fine card; it's just not as aggro as people generally want to be with murlocs.  Quest kind-of pushes you into building a slightly different deck with a more value oriented game plan and Shudderwock to copy Megafin's battlecry and Scargill to make Megafin a 1 mana 8/8.
---
Just...wild murloc shaman has a role in the wild meta, and that role is "hitting Big Priest and Quest Mage in the face really hard by turn 4".  Murloc Quest doesn't fit into that gameplan.  You put in Murloc quest+shudderwock if you want to beat like...Odd Warrior.
---
I have only ever gotten good things from Khadgar. My rng is legendary
---
This deck isn‚Äôt an auto win by any means. Tends to run out of cards quickly if you can kill the Angler and silence the Tastyfin.
---
Second one, Violet Hold, the prison cells have already shattered.
---
Sure did.  I didn't know that Rogue has a really easy time casting a lot cheap spells in one turn.  I figured at best, this guy was a 4/4 or 6/6 and wasn't impressed.
---
Holy nova was like consecration but you also got a mass heal for only 1 extra mana
---
"This is in contrast to the paradigm of pseudo-random number generation commonly implemented in¬†computer programs."
---
I was lucky or unlucky enough depending on how you look at it to have 2 golden copies sitting in my account for a while, would've loved a trade mechanic in the client for situations like that!
---
I agree. That's why my pick is chillwind yeti. 4/5 for 4?? That card was used in mid range druid for years and was always happy to see it in arena. Great card.
---
Or when I had 8 cards in hand , Khadgar gave a "couple extra copies" , they are always good! Well yeah, but next turn my Jaina got burnt and I really needed all the healing from her.
---
But hey. I got like 3 copies of fire flies
---
Happened to me once on a Rumble Run. Was against the pirate with a shrine that play spells 2 additional times with the druid that refreshes mana when you gain armor. Afer dealing with 472828383828 ambushes i finally put her to 1 hp, but the fcker got armor from an academic espionage so i had to ui her while dying from fatigue.
---
She beat me the second time üò§
---
I wasn't wrong with:
---
Magma Rager.
---
Silverback patriarch
---
the 5/4 Panda Brewer.  As vanilla HS went at the time, this was a unique stat, along with  Harrison (too costly. even with the Dk paladin, that's hard to pull off)
---
To this day, the Wisp needs to shine. The first vanilla 0 mana 1/1.  There is the free Edwin buff, questing adventurer, etc, etc, the memes by Trump for inifinite value, there is the "poor man's Dr. 7"
---
Poor wisp has been outshined by tinyfin, and the penguin due to the cuteness factor.  And cursed tinyfin, ruining my paladin secret-Anyfin.
---
I was right with Coldlight being used in a mill setup.
---
Yeah every patch does that. You have to download the sound assets every time
---
Have you thought about hiding a NFC chip in between the layers?  You could program it to just play his sound effects when scanned.
---
Pass
---
Tracking is one of the best cards in the game. You are putting way too much emphasis on burning cards. It is not a big deal at all because you don't need every card in your deck to win. Think of how often you fatigue as hunter. In games where you dont fatigue, all the cards left in your deck basically didn't exist that game. 
---
Hunter could get away with playing a 20 card deck if it could. Virtually every deck in the game would be better with fewer cards. Consistency in card games is super important and fewer cards=  more consistency.
---
"Hoping and praying" to get something off tracking is no different than what happens at the start of every turn. And if tracking burns three irrelevant cards for the specific MU you're playing that is just dandy.
---
Point 4 I don't understand at all. Look up expected value. Think of airbags vs no airbags in your car. Yeah, sometimes airbags hurt you but the expected value tilts towards you not having a shattered skull. There will be cases where you lose to fatigue, but you **probably** lost those games anyway with or without tracking.
---
Nope. They still wouldn't.
---
Elixir of Vim is also in there too for continual draw. Insane deck!
---
I see no downside to it
---
Lololololwut. This isn't the competitive hearthstone subreddit. You're out of your mind. This subreddit is filled with countless utter morons who never play, rarely play or suck ass when they play.
---
Oooo you purposely have more spells, that's smart. Thank you. I've been playing for about a month now or so and I've still yet to build a competitive deck. I just add cards I like, but I'm still having a hard time finding synergies. What you suggested makes sense though, thanks.
---
Given that every other Roguelike out there is PVE I think they were just referring to hearthstone modes.
---
And? RNG can be perfect, PRNG can't, look at your first comment.
---
I AM THE ESSENCE OF MECHJICS
---
not having enough dust and not thinking zilliax is worth it is synonymous.
---
Kripp shouldn‚Äôt be school chef, that‚Äôs for sure
---
Each minion on the board attacks another, both deal damage to each other and the game models each attack as happening all at once
---
Honestly Gurubashi berserker is OP when you're with  priest against starter decks. Hit, +3 attack, heal, hit, +3 attack heal, it gets you a whole bunch of value and tempo, before it gets removed, and if it gets removed, then they wasted a removal spell on a 5 drop, then you just drop the core hound, and ez win
---
i always trade into his minions and also i have hellfire in the deck
---
i did burn it most of the time
---
Amazing improvement in the amount of details you were able to add to the one on the right
---
It doesnt mean anything mate.
---
&gt; And amount of times that, when playing this on Turn 5, an opponent had dominating control of the board such that this wouldn't survive a turn, is probably 20%, yeah.
---
They don't have to clear it. They just have to play any respectable 5 drop like any of the 4-6 drops and it trades evenly after you have to pay 2 extra.
---
&gt;I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. 5/5/6 O2 with significant upside in early Hearthstone was a fantastic statline. 4/4/5 with nothing else was a nutso statline.
---
5-5-6 with Overload 2 was never acceptable and the upside isn't significant. It's mediocre. Yeti also wasn't nuts. It was good. That's it.
---
&gt;Because they're similar situations in different environments. Gurubashi was a meta-defining card in Beta. As was Chillwind Yeti.
---
What meta were you playing? Rank 25 meta doesn't count.
---
&gt;No, it's only bad when your opponent controls the board to a staggering degree. When you played Mage, that usually only happened if they had a Chillwind Yeti out or you went seconds and they curved the nuts.
---
Dude it's never good. How do you understand so little about the game that you don't get this? How is the card good when you are in any way behind? The opponent can just ignore it and watch you spend 2 more mana to turn it into a useful card.
---
&gt;Two things here. One, you're "investing" two mana with 4/7/7 too, so that point is moot. The Vanilla statline was good, and there was a huge upside attacked to that body, which was "every time this takes damage, give it 3 attack", which was fantastic.
---
First of all, 2 mana on t5 is worth less than 2 mana on t4 and a 7-7 on t4 is worth more than a 7-7 on t6. That's why overload is such a strong mechanic.
---
Second, a 6-7-7 is still good while a 7-5-6 is never good. You also don't seem to realize that your opponent has to deal with a 2-7 and not a 5-6 on their turn which is a massive difference.
---
Third, a 5-2-7 was always bad. The upside is not huge. It's okay at best. Usually it means that you spend 2 mana to give a minion +3/-1 which is simply not good.
---
&gt;Paid over 2 turns, in Beta Hearthstone, when cards were utter shit, it was.
---
Uhm I don't think you ever played beta HS. The majority of basic class cards were nerfed early on. It was full of charge otk stuff. Describe any class that had any serious trouble with this card ever or any deck that used this card succesfully. Just because you pay it over 2 turns doesn't make it good at all because you are still paying too much. 
---
&gt;You can't seriously be continually arguing that two mana on a future turn is not identical to two mana on the same turn. There's a reason why Overload cards are played, and it's dishonest to call Lightning Storm a 5 mana card.
---
It's not same, I just wanted to showcase that even after investing 2 hero powers into it was still nothing mindboggling. 
---
&gt;Sure, you can argue that it has a downside of being a 2/7 when it first comes out. That's a completely valid criticism, except that was usually more than enough. 5/2/7 that became a 5/6 was a really good tempo move in Beta.
---
It was a 2-7 that turned into a 5-5-6 with overload 2. That was always garbage. A understatted minion that needs more investement to become appropriately statted was never good tempo. That is the complete opposite of tempo.
---
&gt;Remember, beta was filled with shit cards.
---
No it wasn't. Beta was filled with unleash OTK, molten giant OTK, freezemage with cheaper freezes and 8 mana pyroblast, 2 mana buzzard, 8 mana mind control, 5 mana sylvanas, permanent dark iron dwarf buff, 1 mana execute, 0 mana hunters mark, basically every rogue card stronger.
---
The list goes on. 
---
Tell me any deck that did anything where this card played any role. Pit Lord is a 4-5-6 with battlecry deal 5 to yourself and that card saw little play 5 health is so much less worth than 1 mana upfront and 2 mana later.
---
yup XD
---
I disenchanted a sylvanas üòì
---
Ahh ok , makes sense... but honestly am I misreading or does the card description come off a bit sloppy?
---
I miss that deck so much. Everytime the champs tavern brawls comes back I love playing firebats druid deck. It makes me so happy.

We're discussing stats. Wanting to craft something but can't afford it looks the same as not knowing it's good. You're talking out of your ass.
---
In true rng fashion. Each minion attacks another minion at random. So your minions may attack your other minions or your opponents and your opponents might attack their own or yours.
---
As soon as I saw the dopple card this is the deck I wanted to make but so far haven't pulled it off yet.  Grats
---
\[\[Spirit of the Shark\]\]
---
Reading the card tells you what the card does.
---
I got a golden vancleef really really early and wanted to dust him for a long time because "what's the point of a 2/2 that gets bigger when i can craft yogg instead"
---
Luckily my gf kept me from making that grave mistake
---
okay but if he didnt had at least 1 or 2 battlecries that change other minions beforehand that wouldn't do the trick.  
---
but we already understand that that rogue was a noob and lost his first pogo for free and his last with hex, so in the end he won, although a skilled rogue player should not lose this anymore, especially with pogos that go beyond 10/10.

What‚Äôs wrong with wanting a quest system that makes sense? You‚Äôre all blind fanboys.

If Shark said ‚Äúan additional time‚Äù instead of twice, then they would stack.

No it wasn't. That card was only played in Freeze Mage to burst face.

id do the "babbling book" copypasta but im lazy.

I like earning gold. This game only pretends to be free to play.

Well OP you are gonna love OTK Decks, warrior can be beaten rather easily even though they may seem like giant behemoths of board clear and armor they are really slow and not very aggressive so you have lots of time to setup combos, every deck type has a counter you just have to find it

When he said pve roguelites I think he meant hearthstone pve roguelites.

No. It says they trigger twice, not an additional time.

The difference is "twice" dictates how many times it triggers, two times, and an additional time adds one to the number of times it triggers, which would allow it to stack like with Gonk.

Would you guys kindly shut the fuck up about dust management? Quests in this game suck ass.

Someone surprised Hunter is the number one class?
---
I mean what can go wrong giving cheap single minion removal \[Venomizer\] and \[Spider bomb\] to a class that punishes you if you have a wide board \[Unleash the hound\].
---
Just change venomizer to 5 mana 4/4 so they can't abuse so easy that broken combo venom+missile, save the silences for spider and then you have a more healthy class.
---
If we talk about the other classes Omega Defender and Underbelly Angler (2 mana draw infinite murlocs) are a must in all archetype class decks which just show how ridiculous is the value they put once they are used.

I had a Zoo beat me out of the blue with a Zilliax.

that deck is a disease that needs to be eradicated. Yesterday.
---
I enjoy something about the game. I do not know if I can leave. But I‚Äôm newish, my only arsenal so far is Priest, and it really sucks. Even if I try to play aggro mech Priest it just isn‚Äôt as enjoyable as actually pulling off Priest mechanics. The pace of the game has sort of become much less fun.
---
Although it is good the Death Knights are gone, my favorite match ever was against a DK Jaina. I played infinite HP Dragon Soul and the wrangle lasted an hour. It is very difficult to pull that off in this environment (Bonswamdi Priest vs Warrior is a possibility) but the warrior deck in that scenario requires very little skill and survives that long only because of terribly overpowered cards.

The quest system, as with all systems created by imperfect being such as ourselves, could use some work, yes. However, the problem you are experiencing is entirely of your own making for this reason:
---
&gt;I have recently liquidated most of the legendaries I acquired throughout the years to build ONE decent deck. 
---
Perhaps, if you didn't nuke much of your collection, you would have something better than awful to play through quests with.
---
Came to the comments and was sad to hear this :/ if you ever change your mind please DM me!  Would love to purchase a couple for a future game room. Even if they are like $100-$200 a piece.
---
Vanish is one to look out for too
---
Sorry about that! Fixed.
---
If we are calling Dungeon Runs in HS roguelike (you didn't nit-pick that) what with there being 0 'levels' and set enemies and decks, and set buckets of possible cards then one can use that loose definition of a roguelike to also cover battleroyale. Moreso I think, since the available loot truly is random, and the enemies are random.
---
This but tracking
---
Meh, still mediocre because all the freeze cards in Shaman are mediocre and not worth the slots. You want to know a probably playable iteration? Something in the line of "Whenever another minion is Frozen, add a copy of it to your hand. Battlecry: Freeze a minion."
---
I also believed it was a completely dead card in the late game. I had no idea it gave out a consolation prize.
---
I'l record the next one, how do you beat them in the long run? They get so much value even dire frenzy can't keep up.
---
I play that deck sometimes, but I've been rocking Miracle Yogg Mage since before Mana Cyclone was even a card. I absolutely know it's a much worse deck this way, but I have a lot of fun playing it. I have a few different miracle homebrews I run on ladder.
---
Animal companion does so much for 3 mana. Summons a 4/2, hits me in the face with it, emotes "greetings traveller"
---
My copy is bugged though, just summons a garbage 2/4
---
You replay that numbered boss, it could be a different boss. Happened to me twice in my last run, once to stupidity, once to a random spell off the scrolls of wisdom or whatever
---
I'll edit the rule to clarify it a tad.
---
The "true rng" you are referencing uses a source that is in theory impossible to predict therefore random. It is however not truly random.  What I said is correct.
---
Same with KT, and it's potential power is really showcased in the singleplayer where it can solo bosses like no other card
---
Report and remove for misspelling rogue.
---
Just reading this is inspiration enough for me to throw together a deck around SC. Wahooooo!!!
---
&gt;I'm a relatively new player.  I'm at rank 8 right now playing mid range hunter.
---
Deck list plox?
---
And I'm guessing the AI isn't smart enough to realize he shouldn't clear your board.
---
He's a good arena card.  It's unfortunate he doesn't cost 5 mana though.  He often winds up being worse than Silver Hand Knight (4/4 summon a 2/2) since he will get removed before he makes another gnoll.
---
I wonder if there are any others that have a similar situation. 
---
Most roguelites I know require walking to the exit of the level so that eliminates a significant portion of them.
---
It was surprisingly versatile. You could silence it with a 2 mana iron beak owl. Taunt it of course. Zoo decks couldn't leave it up because shadowflame was always a threat.
---
Handlock made so many weak/mediocre cards good. Loved that deck.
---
At the time it made a lot of people feel.... in chaaaarge

---
Leeroy, pre nerf even, the thought was why would I play a card that just dies.
---
Oh man. The stars aligned for you my dude
---
Well... while I see your point, I highly doubt OP would've questioned the inclusion of brainstorm given the two cards you "lose" aren't discarded and you can literally choose your curve for the next two turns.
---
It's the discarding thing that gets people. What if I need spiderbomb, but my tracking shows me Zuljin, so now I have to take spiderbomb but I will never get Zul'jin! (Well guess what, you weren't going to even make it to 10 mana without spiderbomb so...) but still that's the thing that makes it seem dumb. 
---
When I first started I thought that surely Warlock was a meme class or meant to up the difficulty for players who were tired of simpler classes because why would you want to damage yourself?

You are probably just not good enough  to realize your mistakes, the idea that you are playing perfect is laughable

You woulden‚Äôt say you are exaggerating just a bit? you can play around a lot of warrior cards, hell the best they have is brawl and shield slam, if you force out or play around both brawls it‚Äôs no problem, not to mention shield slam can be countered with mage secrets easily or by just hitting your opponent early to prevent any big armor gain, it all depends on what you‚Äôre playing, in my experience my Luna‚Äôs pocket galaxy mage crushes warrior easily, because they don‚Äôt do anything they just sit and wait most of the time. Giving me plenty of time to do some crazy shenanigans or just out value him with conjurer‚Äôs calling. The only annoying thing is dr. boom and his mechs but even then that is beatable
---
I am absolutely livid.
---
I used it to climb to 5, but I've been laddering less, I'm in quests and PvE mode. I also have Boomzooka in mine for laughs (which I have yet to play - the game's usually over by the time I get it if I even draw it). It's the only deck I play for the little laddering for laddering's sake I do, because it's a lot of fun. But not a representative sample.
---
I actually refused to play Warlock for the first couple of months of the game because discarding as a drawback and a hero power that damaged you seemed horrible to me.  I think a lot of people thought Doomguard was a bad card until Reynad put it in Zoo.  I remember Kripp drafting an arena deck and chat had to convince him that doomguard wasn't a bad pick.
---
uuuuuuhm... ggs i mean :/ full hand on turn 1 = value?
---
Fatigue doesn't matter if you never draw the last card in your deck. Frequently games are over before either player draws the last card in their deck. If Gnomeferatu is used in a situation that causes the opposing player to die to fatigue damage they'd have otherwise survived, it's an excellent use of the card. That wasn't the common case. The common case that made people think it's a better card than it really is was when it burned a combo piece causing the opposing player to concede.
---
The thing is: the odds of playing Gnomeferatu and an essential combo piece being on top of the deck are the same as the odds of playing River Croc and that essential combo piece was on the bottom of the deck, but the practical outcome of those two situations is nearly identical. Not exactly identical; Gnomeferatu is absolutely better for the Warlock than River Croc. But not hugely better, just more than none better. But way flashier.

You shouldn't have to play any minions turns early, since the boss can't play any without transferring one to you, which you can trade off. By the time you get to 5 mana and the AI starts to play its Former Champs, you should have enough low-cost minions in your hand to buffer the right side of your board so you don't give the boss anything valuable.

---
I never said tracking on 1 is bad, i said playing it mindlessly on turn 1 is bad. just playing it on turn 1 when you already have a turn 2 and 3 play is straight up bad, espescially in metas where some popular classes have several, very different, metadecks, like piratewarrior and ctrlwarrior in one meta. for example in times when zoolock and even/ctrl/handlock was a thing, YOU DO NOT TRACKING ON 1!!!! you need to know if you're digging for deadly shot/freezing vs giant and  facedamage or if you're looking for boardcontroling tools like bow/explosive etc.

Shaman hero power - 1 mana draw a card - Overload (1)
---
Scepter of Summoning and the -2 mana left-hand card goggles
---
So Tracking is only good because it's a Hunter card? Ask yourself this, if Tracking was in Warlock - would anyone play it? So how are they that much different? You're just saying that classes are different, not cards.
---
Then you said nothing.
---
Sap, however, has gotten increasingly insane. Used to be, aww man, have to repay the mana for that again. But now... goddamn he‚Äôs gonna get in a lot chip damage now that I can‚Äôt interact with the board for an additional turn.

If you haven‚Äôt fixed it yet I had the same problem. I uninstalled by going into settings-&gt;general-&gt;iPhone storage then deleted hearthstone that way. I then restarted my phone and reinstalled and it worked. Someone else posted this in an earlier thread but I can‚Äôt find it.
---
Based on the board state, and ending in a draw actually being helpful (better than losing), didn't Khadgar actually help you out then?
---
Np.  Take those 19 cards for your Midrange Hunter and either disenchant a some bad cards (also using HSR to find out quality) or just just improvise around the missing cards.
---
It has very good replayabillity and decent rewards

&gt;What rank are you? There's no such thing as a deck thinning hunter. Tracking helps you pick up immediate answers. The purpose is not to thin your deck.
