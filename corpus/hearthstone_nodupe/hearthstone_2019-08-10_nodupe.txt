I would definitely be cool, but to be fair there's so many good warlock options

good thing you can punch it with your hero power
---
Your gf is a sperm container
---
Wouldn’t it also be better to use Power of the Wild to buff the chicken instead of Abusive? That way you get enough board space for the full set of Bees for the overkill buff.
---
That's right. Millhouse Manastorm is a great tech card against King Phaoris. Gonna have to put him in all my decks from now on.

I mean, I don't like playing as or against control warrior either, but you gotta acknowledge that a lot of people do find playing the deck fun. Whether it's the playstyle or if they just like winning.
---
Evidently many do, no reason to run it otherwise.
---
No shit it's a deck that didn't need any upgrades and its preying on all the unrefined greedy decks noobs are playing.. let the meta settle and watch.
---
'Zephrys is a unique card that couldn't be implemented in a real life game'
---
Of course it can!
---
The player can simple add a token card that represents whatever card in the game he wants.

Just a heads up, no one is gonna take you seriously whether you're right or wrong when you end comments like that

I'm not 100% sure, but from my understanding he doesn't look at the cards in your hand, so the best tempo play given the information he had was a BGH. Surprised there was no polymorph effect though. Can't answer for the other cards either.

It's not proactive tho. The Pally player can just hold and wait for his Coldlight. But I guess it can stall for a bit sometimes.

This is a straight up quality post

I would also love more balance patches.. I mean it's not like they have to reprint any card, they could balance cards more frequently.

Nah, I can't see a physical game being played but certainly see people wanting to buy cards for display

Here is the link to the deck: [http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1300828-rez-quest-priest](http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1300828-rez-quest-priest)
---
It works basically the same as other rez priest decks that utilize the big taunt minions. The difference being that SOU gave some really great new tools for it. Pychopomp is great for resurrecting minions and giving them reborn. Also I noticed that every time I use Mass Resurrection that it does not pull Psychopomp. This is also the case with Catrina Muerte not pulling Psychopomp. Not sure if I have just gotten lucky with it or what. Damaged Stegotron is great with the new quest hero power. For 8 mana you get a 8/12 minion with taunt on the board. It is also nice with Zilliax, especially when you give Zilliax reborn.

Seriously though it really seems like Blizzard thinks the Arthas thing is enough War Crime for the Alliance for the next 10'000 years. "He was so epic and badass he counts for 20 horde villains!"
---
HA!
---
I know a guy who knows a guy...
---
I am probably the minority when I say this, but I don't mind frost nova as a card. I think it is a good tool that allows for some play around. You gotta know when you should leave a space open on the board, etc. 
---
It can be annoying for sure, especially when they can get more, but I think that is more of a problem with the amount of spell generation mage has access to nowadays.
---
dr boom and conjurer's calling have been the designated cards to whine about for a couple months now. i guess no one could decide which card was the problem in mech hunter, the deck that actually was the most meta dominant, and whining about the magnetic mechanic as a whole didn't catch on. the whining about warrior supposedly dominating the meta has increased with the new expansion which is strange considering the combined meta representation of control and bomb warrior has dropped from 17% ( https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-136/ ) to 9% since the new expansion released ( https://hsreplay.net/meta/#tab=matchups ).

Nope. Blizzard works in their own time. I think the earliest we've seen is a couple weeks, some happen after a couple months. I take it they'll react quicker if there's a clear issue. I don't know what their benchmark is on how bad it needs to get. Heck, possible we don't see any balance changes. Completely at Blizzards discretion.
---
Wait, how does Nozdormu stop the rope? Won't he guarantee you run out of time?

I really wish they would lighten the cost for cards and increase the number of cosmetics you can buy. Id totally spend more money if they had more options for different hero portraits.
---
KreyGasm
---
Hallå!!
---
But not every class can do that. And we are coming back towards a renaissance of deathrattles, because the prior sets, they really pulled back on the deathrattles save for mechs, which can be slow in a lot of builds. 
---
Hunter pulls it off because they have cards that synergize with it. Not every class has this. Take Druid for example. Even if I build with deathrattle mechs, I will still lose to a warrior because I can't afford space to run only mechs. So, even if I get a deathrattle off, then buff my minions, the warrior just kills it off.
---
Hunter on the other hand can take back board with spiderbomb, or flood the board just as fast with sticky mech minions that they can then magnetize again and again.
---
TLDR it just isn't that easy for every class to just build for deathrattles.
---
Yeah what you said makes sense. I look at it like 2/2 is about 1.5 mana, .5 mana taunt, .5 mana "card draw" and .5 mana for bundling in "I know a guy"
---
So really it feels like you're paying 2 mana for 3 mana value but .5 of that mana is what I'd call a "meta cost" since bundling doesn't really have a cost associated and is usually represented as either one mana or a downside ("To my side" deckbuilding restriction for example).
---
Dr boom wasn't complained about before because tess and baku were much bigger problems. Why cry about a flea when a wolf is attacking you? 
---
Dr boom was good before but it was overshadowed by other broken cards. Now Dr boom is the last of the busted cards of old and it clearly shows since they've effectively reset the power level of the last 2 expansions.
---
People defending infinite value? What year is it?
---
THIS IS STILL A ZOO DECK. Tip just builds on what is already possible with zoo-y murloc pally.
---
Conjurer Mage is a midrange-combo deck, like Deathrattle Hunter from last rotation.
---
Shirvallah and Conjueror’s Calling don’t entirely rely on a super niche spell from three expansions ago to work. You could remove any single card from the deck they’re in and they’ll still work pretty well, while Tip the Scales can’t work without being cheated out. Additionally, did any of the streamers even consider the existence of Prismatic? With how niche it was, it saw little play, so it’s 100% fair for them to have given it a 1/5 star.
---
Good thorough post. Lots of good points I agree with. Having just climbed to legend with control warrior today with a day record of 23-10 I definitely agree it's super strong. 
---
&gt;The card along with a simple package of mechs and mech generation can virtually shut down any attempt at establishing a reasonable board presence for so long that by the time someone finally does Warpath, Brawl and Plague of Wrath can always be there to answer it.
---
I will say that this has always been how control warrior was played, even before Dr. Boom or mechs were a thing. Warrior is supposed to have a shit ton of removal, because if there's ever just a couple of rounds where they can't clear the board early or mid, they're gonna lose really quick. Warrior vs aggro has always been about juuust stretching your survival until the point when you can pop your cards which make the balance swing a ton almost instantly. But this has been helped a lot by the new taunt cards. 
---
The reason it's so strong right now imo is a combination of a few things:
---
-control warrior is a deck which is just good across patches, strong late game and a lot of removal is always gonna go a long way, it doesn't rely on specific cards as much as many other decks but has many ways of doing the same thing (removing).
---
-virtually eternal value from Dr. Boom hero power, every hero power is potentially worth as much as a regular card.
---
-The new cards make it a lot better early and midgame because of the taunts. Before warriors would often lose to super aggro decks because it takes time to come online, but now they can drop taunt minions and mummy is a much better removal than militia. 
---
So essentially a deck which was already good against most had it weaknesses limited while also making some of its hard counters (specifically bomb warrior) useless.
---
I think it should be smaller gradual nerfs to the Dr boom care and the hero powers rather than a radical change like altering the rush thing which would essentially render the entire deck trash. The rush thing is what makes this card what it is, altering it just a little will ruin control warrior at least in this form. Instead the hero power and probably omega devastator, and possibly omega assembly as well should be nerfed iyam. The rush thing gives the warrior a lot of options and maneuverability, but the real issue imo is the amount of value it can extract just from the hero power.

Zapphire is a really good card though
---
I see!
---
I should note that I don't run the most popular lists. 
---
I think there are too many mechs honestly and that kangor's probably isn't worth it, but maybe I'm wrong.
---
I run a prelate so I can get that sweet sweet undatakuh with prelate/whelp/egg combo and copy him continuously.
---
I run wrapped golem as well and make copies so they have to work hard to remove those. The bone wraith, khartut defender, and wrapped golem really make it hard on them after copying and basically just keeps a wall of taunts until undatakuh is ready to play.
---
I also added zephrys recently and that's been paying off big. Guy played zuljin, and had 4 secrets, so I played zephrys for a flare and boom, got it.
---
I should say I've been really lucky to have enough removal for the giants when they come out. My opponents just haven't been as smart I guess. But the early pressure is what's making them play a giant as early as possible vs waiting to play it with conjurer's calling.

according to your 5 game sample size warrior is 80% of the meta this expansion. according to hsreplay's 2 million+ game sample size it's 12%. 
---
https://hsreplay.net/meta/#tab=matchups  
---
which do you think is more likely to be accurate?
---
What's this screenshot from then? It shows you with 3 wins
---
Yeah. There's a few epics and that Twin Emperor. That would suck to want to play again and not be able to.
---
i played it as a one of in my control warrior when it was new. i had it in my opening hand one of my first games and played it in fatigue to win.
---
it tricked me for a little bit.
---
It's already hundreds of times more likely to open a 1 rare pack than 2 legendaries, let alone 3.
---
I’ve done it a few times. Being F2P, I sometimes have to make sacrifices. I just did it recently with some legendaries and epics I hadn’t used in a while.
---
What's wrong with you
---
&gt;Get ready to skip the adventure like usual
---
FTFY
---
Obviously, if it was actually turn 10, an arma was left able to buff twice. Doesn't matter if they had one or three. Arma is priority kill target when you're against taunt warrior.
---
Cultist lockets for Mormons then?
---
It doesn't destroy Quest Paladin, or Quest Shaman, or most of the Quests, but nevermind, they're too expensive. Might as well complain because my budget deck doesn't beat it.
---
He pretty much just gives you Tirion or Twisting Nether every time.
---
alright this card is amazing..
---
Yeah, sorry I didn't buy 80 packs this go around. Wasn't in the budget.
---

---
Wild guess here, most of the wins came from Odd Pally?
---
I dont have zephs yet but my worry is the core is freeze mage. I will probably try a quest 1's varient later i am attracted to the idea.
---
And give the mechs Charge instead of Rush, so he is no longer an infinite value engine !!!
---
Fair point
---
Interesting! That's a lot better than I was expecting.
---
Overkill just works when it happens on your turn, doesn't care about who attacks who

According to Zalae, and everyone else really, go craft Zilliax ASAP.

Can you draw my favorite card, blink fox
---
A good chunk came from that yes, I was a new player when that deck was relevant. I’ve played a lot of Shirvallah and Mech Pallie.
---
Good for you man
---
But that one made sense when you think about it for 3 seconds
---
I started to run Plague of Murlocs because my scheme was always too slow to answer anything. Then I cut that because it just sat in my hand all day against everything else. I've had more success just going the tempo/burn version where you just generate cards like crazy and point all of the damage battlecrys to face.
---
You can even beat control warriors if you play it correctly (assuming  they don't draw and play Dr. Boom on 7 like they always seem to).

Just 6 legends + 2 from preorders &amp; 2000 dust, &amp; correct both preorders &amp; the $70 (60 packs), after tax is over $200.

I never understood why they called those a lamp when they look more like a teapot or something
---
Fun is different to everyone.
---
They mean placing on top of the deck.
---
Probability-wise, it doesn't matter what card you remove with Gnomeferatu, they're all 1/X to be picked.
---
I guess the way to change that probability would be to Mischief Maker into Gnomeferatu if the card you give them is good, but why?
---
God i can't wait until they try to nerf this and end up just hurting the other non- oppressive paladin decks, i.e. equality
---
"Zephyrs, help me!! What do I do??"
---
"**E N D M Y S U F F E R I N G**"
---
I mean, isn’t that better? It’s usually a bad card for the opponent, meaning it takes up hand space, and has the potential to overdraw them.
---
I'm just saying its different than echo
---
This deck can be improved a lot. 
---
I would replace Omega agent with Ziliax.
---
Implosion with Hellfire.
---
Chittering Tunneler	with Zola for that sweet second copy of Emperor Thaurissan or even Reno.
---
Complain about fair when your not playing control warrior
---
Getting sick of a T2 Zephrys turning the game against me, it becomes an uphill battle

But for most mana costs you can’t guarantee what you get. 1 mana down for random, 1 mana up for twinspell.
---
He’s a pretty cool card but if you’re a budget player probably not. Most of the good Highlander decks use a lot of legendaries you might not have.
---
I've won plenty of times as priest and highlander decks though. Most people can't resist duping a full board of eggs only to be mass dispeled by zephrys and unable to play anything.

---
&gt; I guess stick a mech and then Portal + SnipSnap a bunch of times?
---
Yes, that's a main win condition, happens quite often.
---
You bet I did and it was totally worth it
---
I don't understand why the Zombeast is a 3/8 in the lowest image. It appears to be a made with Tundra Rhino (2/5 stats) and a Haunted Creeper (1/2 stats.) Shouldn't that make it a 3/7 instead?
---
Looking at the history bar it seems that the Zombeast was the last card played before the opponent conceded. Since it has a full green border it must have charge, and I cannot think of any other combination that would produce those stats.
---
Nothing is going to change with Boom without nerfs.  He isn't going to magically get figured out as the deck itself has actually gotten stronger with a few new cards.  
---
If there were anything that was going to magically remedy the deck in the meta it would have already shown up.  You can of course beat control warrior but the decks that comfortably beat it aren't that fun to play themselves and tend to get really owned by other decks.  There is a distinct lack of balance.
---
&gt; Or the cards in those packs are made of some kind of edible cracker
---
Oh of course, the cards being edible crackers goes without saying.
---
"Abused." You mean used once? The deck doesn't have any way to recycle her.
---
I feel your pain, I went through the exact same thing and it caused me to abandon the deck.
---
I AM CRYING
---
You be gotten 1 epic and the 1/10 new packs legendary pls give your luck to me
---
Same, and it was far from an unbeatable deck.  Most games were quite challenging!
---
Because obviously how could they possibly be wrong? No no, it’s everyone else that’s wrong.

I mostly play shaman and faced a lot of quest paladin. If I use an aggro murloc/overload deck I tend to win, and if I use quest shaman its a lot more difficult. Depending on the meta, if more people use quest shaman, it good be a good match up.
---
I tend to lose a lot to control warrior though..... so....maybe if you think people will play more shaman... then...yah.... haha
---
Um sweetheart it’s called “Blackwing -Zephyros the Elite”. 🤦‍♀️
---
No need to go in rage mode, this will certainly be fixed and should know who you have double cards in your deck...
---
Unfortunately I can only give one upvote but you sir are a man of culture
---
0.5 percentage chance!
---
They changed how the buff is applied in such a way that many minions no longer get the buff. I believe that the quest reward buff now only applies to minions played from the hand, minions summoned via other means come out with their default stats.
---
It's not infinite, it costs 2 less and it's totally random, so enjoy your totem buffs on your mage.
---
The problem isn't really that the cards are too weak but rather there just isn't enough room for the new archetypes and none of it is really good enough. I that after the year of the raven rotates SoU and RoS will see a jump in popularity
---
Well, if we're talking about Wild, no he is not. It's not like warrior is a particularly strong card, and there are better Hero cards out there.
---
This is beautiful
---
Rad! Big Priest!
---
It should have been "discover a mage spell" instead of it being totally random.

Plague of Murlocs, Gryphon Trainer, the guy who fills both boards with imps (Mad Summoner I guess), Devolve. The usuals in Hex (toss in Zentimo if feeling fancy) and Polymorph. As Priest you can play Lazul's Scheme + Cabal Shadow Priest, or any other combination of stealing schenanigans (eg. shadow madness + reclaimer).

I opened him in a pack. And i saw Thijs put it in his deck. It works very well before Naga Sand Witch is cast.
---
does he actually say somthing different ?
---
\*Laughs in Brawl\*
---
Why are you so triggered, Mr Control Warrior ?
---
Atleast for most other classes they thought of a new requirement from the old quest. For mage they took the old requirement (cast spells from not your deck) as the reward and made an even more boring quest (cast spells).
---
My problem with this quest is how hard it's tied to this expansion. Unlike every other quest, this one's requirement is supported only by this set going forward, and that's kind of sad.
---
It is bad though. Everytime a halfway decent aoe gets released, it's first on the chopping block. Very easy to play around.
---
Zephrys listened to the wishes of players that wished this bullshit deck didn't exist.
---
That's why people are stopping spending money on such games, 80€/$ to get 50% of the game.
---
Then he realises he doesnt truly know her, she's just a faceless manipulator.
---
I remember the BS about HS should not have infinite value card because they feel oppressive and also some classes should be bad at card generation.
---
Now there is at least one infinite-y card genrator per class in standard. Well played Blizzard, you played yourself
---
Dont expect too much, blizzard fucking suck nowdays.
---
What is that decks win con? Did you overdraw it?
---
I'm not. Freeze effects into constant 6+ mana cards does not sound fun.
---
I have literally not lost a single match to control warrior with mech/buff paladin since the release of the expansion. Its THAT bad of a matchup for the warrior.

This is interesting because I had the exact opposite problem. I had my opponent down to 6 health with an 8 attack minion on board. Since I knew the secret was vaporize I played Zephrys hoping for fireball. Instead I got windfury, BoK and a minion.
---
Should be 2 mana freeze your opponents board. You guys can do it almost indefinitely anyways.
---
Play it with some cyclone shenanigans, I consistently finish the quest in 7,8 turns. Not especially busted but still better than turn 10

I'm terrible at Tavern Brawl. Just terrible. I think I went 0-4 in the chess one. Now I'm 1-6 this week. I guess I need to watch videos on how to actually play this game.
---
Worst part is, I've got a quest that says to win 3 Tavern Brawl matches. I should probably give up on that one and get a new quest.
---
Mmmh... I see you got Tirion from Zephrys
---
Even the way damage works in Hearthstone is heavily reliant on it being digital. There's a reason damage to creatures doesn't persist through turns in MTG, and persistent effects usually hit both power and toughness at the same time - it's a nightmare to keep track of how much damage a creature has taken and how that interacts with buffs in a paper TCG.
---
I think pokemon does it but I'm not sure how they make it manageable.
---
Really Hearthstone is wall to wall with good digital only stuff.
---
The problem is, that by the time you get the quest off you're not really in a place where you can afford to hero power. You're normally needing a specific spell to save your butt and you can't take a risk on the random discounted spell it'll give you, especially for 2 mana. IMO of all the quests it's the worst, more so than Warrior. Warrior doesn't see play because control/bomb is better, but if you get it up and running the 4/3s are pretty oppressive especially combined with Sulthraze for example.
---
May have worked if you'd played him on an empty board after attacking into the Vaporize?
---
Thekal+Double Giant is rare in Wild but has a very high winrate..

still not Tier 0

Yeah in retrospect it was 100% a misplay on my part, so I wasn’t too upset. 
---
It’s just kind of funny that somebody had the complete opposite problem.
---
The 🅱️ncient One is what he calls his dick.
---
Ofc it lacks that aspect. But when you can choose between someone you love beyond measure and is perfect to you in every way in long distance relationship and experimenting in normal relationship I would go with first option anytime. I can understand some people wouldn't cause I put much more emphasis on emotional aspect of realtionship then most people I talked about this
---
I'm jealous. Most times I've tried quest cyclone mage I get 2 evocations in hand and the cyclones are nowhere to be found. Not willing to craft Stargazer for a bad quest deck even though I'm sure you need Luna for the draw.
---
Wait until you meet your priest overlord with atleast 3 board silence lol
---
What makes that minimalist hearthstone field?
---
This is so sad, Zephrys, discover despacito
---
Hey pre-order Bonus there you are, you still didn't come to me!
---
what you've got 6 leggies from 35 packs and you complain? :D
---
You thin your deck out with tracking.
---
It's not strong (as far as I can tell, I'm still curious as to whether that'll change, especially if they do change conjurer) and it's not super interesting designwise, but it's honestly one of the funnest decks I've ever played in terms of just...random pulling things out of nowhere.  So yes, as a meme, but I think it's actually surprisingly fun of a meme.
---
While it's not a deck I'd want to see legitimate play, or a deck I'd want to play all the time, it's a lot of fun to spend a few hours with it at a rank floor.  My version basically just draws and stalls with small spells until it can get a cyclone turn (I often play and finish the quest in one turn, sometimes as early as turn 5 with a perfect draw against an opponent who justifies use of ray of frost), and then it just spends the rest of the game desperately trying to stabilize with a completely random set of tools from hero power+cyclone+dune sculptor.  My hand is always full and I'm always juggling little combos and trying to figure out when to use the few big aoes I get, how to burn useless spells like Pocket Galaxies.  There's no lifegain in the mage spellset other than Ice barrier, and there's a lot of draw, so it's pretty easy to end up getting burned or fatigued out of existence.  But it's chaotic, memetic fun.  
---
Given the fact that Conjurer's is powerful enough to almost singlehandedly enable like 5 archetypes, I don't really think we're ready for a viable mage quest anyway.  Mage's last forays into infinite value and quests weren't super fun to fight against, so perhaps better safe than sorry.
---
Controlling a titan is synonymous with being a titan though.

 If you want to get so deep, we should start to wonder how legendary chicken salvaging pandas have zero attack when charcoal greasefire summer BBQ chicken dust has six
---
I wish it was spells from any class. That would make it better. However I had fun with it, I love casino mage and this just helps my yogg.
---
That's a dumb arguement, you're just saying "meta is polarized, give in and let warrior shape the meta even more"
---
But until now it was only in mirror matchups, and I didn't see many warlocks that ran sac pact
---
Can someone explain how Zephyrus is a counter for Jaraxxus?
---
That's correct
---
Your reply could easily come off as condescending, "kid".
---
3/20 would still be viable. a 3/8 weapon is nothing to laugh at when on top of that you're summoning a 2-6/6 every turn.
---
Have you been playing in standard recently? The decks being played are almost all completely new. The only commonly played decks that even resemble decks from last expansion are token druid and control warrior. Token druid is pretty rare to find, and control warrior, although fairly common, only makes up about 2/3 of the warrior decks being played.
---
Good job dad!
---
Consistent inconsistency
---
It would, but at 4 it helps with late game board clear on that turn.
---
Jaraxxus has a maximum of 15 hp so Zeph can likely find burn damage for lethal.
---
He should offer you sacrificial pact which can destroy jaraxxus as he is a demon
---
Probably would be too much at that point lol. 4 I believe would be good attack for him to have now but almost any amount of "reasonable" attack would still be too weak if he stays at 15 health
---
Fucking hilarious start to my morning
---
The 3 piloted shredders in the game are all considered mechs, though.
---
Are you an infinite arena guy? No matter how much I save up or take advantage of HoF, I cant seem to fully craft more than 2-3 decks at the start of the expac. I mostly get gold from trading the 80g often and grinding brawliseum as much as possible
---
Omega Devastator says Hi.
---
I don't know why you are complaining, while playing the giant mage deck. lol.
---
Nah, about Zephruys.
---
So does nephew &amp; son. This is reddit. Act like you've been on the internet
---
It's just a suit like what Iron man wears. Hence the line, "I'm suitin' up!". Still a regular goblin underneath.
---
Yeah but the people that come out of the piloted shredders when they die aren’t mechs
---
Bug: quest priest
---
I have an 80g quest,adding you now :D
---
I mean there are otk decks that are a lot easier to pull off even earlier, so yea it sucks cuz there's no counter play but you just gotta get em early or run anti combo. Plus combo decks are a lot weaker this year
---
They could make it so that when you destroy Dr Boom it transforms your hero into another random hero card
---
Ahh... Zafyrus
---
I don’t think it would be op,but blizzard said in the most recent hot fix that they don’t plan to hardcode Zephrys for individual card effects.
---
It’s less a question of it making sense in terms of ‘is this the kind of thing I’d expect to be able to exist’, compared to making sense in terms of ‘this guy isn’t a mech why can I kill him with a thing that kills mechs’ 
---
Honestly I don’t think it’s too inconsistent to allow him to be killed by mech effects since you could think of it like the emp operative would destroy his mech suit and make him useless; but all I meant was that it wasn’t the same as spider rank
---
For fun set.

Aren't all of these ultra weak to aggro and being propped up by good match ups against CW?
---
I swear to God if Jeff Kaplan shows up at the next Blizzcon wearing a Zephrys cosplay and introducing himself as Zeph Kaplan I'm just going to mail them my wallet and be done
---
Aggro decks.
---
I wish it were as high as 50%
---
It does have bad matchups but yeah, the deck is fairly easy to get a good winrate with against aggro decks, and therefore it's popular, because Aggro is popular for quick wins
---
Hence repost...
---
I know, I was memeing.
---
It's obvious you are rank 15 and it hurts.
---
Played it as well, but got wrecked by aggro decks at five wins.
---
Murloc Pally stomps on it unfortunately
---
This is the control warriors win rate against silence priest. So silence priest wins 25% of games.
---
Idk tho, my friend is soft infinite and I know arena is better than packs but I dont have as much time so I know it'll take a while to learn arena meta and make a new deck every day. I usually get average or below average wins (the best I've gotten is 7). Is it still the better option
---
The last I bought a preorder was the Witchwood, where they offered 80 packs for $50, compared to the paltry 50 for $50 we get these days. Even then, I still didn't get enough to build any decks in Witchwood, but it was a damn sight better then that it is now. Coincidence that the Witchwood is one of the last HS expansions to truly sell well and post large profit earnings? I think not. Dalaran only got compared to Rastakhan's Rumble in the latest earning report, which is one of the least popular.
---
Sorry, what?...
---
Wants help beating Rogue with Control Warrior
---
Is this a joke? How do you get a bad winrate against Rogue as CW, even with Kripp's luck??
---
Yes, its everywhere here, use the search function.
---
Possibly - although Mike Donais said this is the only one he knows of.
---
I wonder if the comparison to Warrior's new quest is fair. A much easier condition, no minion prerequisite, potentially triggered more than once. Bodies &gt; buffs.
---
Meanwhile, Tyrion

Foris#21765 Looking for someone to spectate EU
---
People should be able to enjoy it, but people should also be able to enjoy other Control decks. For instance, Control Shaman, Paladin, Warlock and Priest..
---
However, for the most part, these decks will not see the light of day because of Control Warrior, it's a problematic deck, Boom is so strong that it allows every Mech to 2 for 1 or even 3 for 1, after Boom's played.
---
How? Would you mind explaining specifically? I'm quite interested :p

All good man,
---
I’ll start off by saying after Rastakhan I stopped making purchases on Hearthstone, the game needs more than just new sets of cards. They need play modes, replay etc. the game is quite old now.
---
Also I’ve seen the player base decline more since Rastakhan. Maybe people feel the same as me.
---
Anyway
---
So for the first part of the question, I’m not counting inflation when I say Hearthstone is getting more expensive. I’m saying to keep up with standard, the pre-order is a must unless you are going Infinite in arena, but then you’d just be an Arena player.
---
Some of the pre orders have sat around $50-80 usd, sometimes it came with multiple options, of course if that happens you need to buy all.
---
I’ve played wild since it came out but finally stopped playing Standard on this years rotation (unless you count Whizbang games, even then I take it to wild most times)
---
I don’t know what the value of a legendary is, I estimate around $2.5~$5.
---
So you drop around $130 to get around 130 packs. You need to open probably 150-200 to get most of the set.
---
The only set I got completed is Boomsday only because I bought both pre-ordered and spend lots of gold. I think I opened around 250 packs.
---
As for the Magic side, it almost seems the same price to get the pre-order for Hearthstone vs getting a Booster Box. I don’t expect to make a profit or to make even 50% of my money back if I ever do sell my cards.
---
The beauty is I can play with my friends they don’t need a device, an account, a deck/some cards to play they just need to know the game and be present.
---
Can’t draft/sealed a Hearthstone pre-order but you can Limited a Box. After that you can do the usual trades and sales.
---
I’m just tired of not having much control of how we play Hearthstone. It’s always 1v1, okay fine, at least allow us to create our own rules.
---
I know a lot of free to play players don’t get much, then they get a legendary for a class they don’t play, so often it just becomes dust. It would be nice, even if it was casual to allow cross class, otherwise they jus got a dead legendary in the class(es) they don’t play.
---
I got a huge feeling (even before this expansion dropped) they will revisit multi class neutrals (?) like Kazakus. If they don’t then really feels kinda boring to play now.
---
That would be broken
---
Zero is less mana than 1 and instead of spending 5 mana doing nothing, the Druid spends 1. The rest is spent actually playing minions
---
looking at this thread I know where some of your RNG went
---
"We are friends now! Hello, friend!"
---
Hilarity. What an amazing combo. Warrior has gotten so incredibly boring and predictable with its control grinding. Just trying to eek out a little more value from Dr. Boom over the course of 40 turns doesn't exactly make a highlight reel.
---
Btw the point of Octosari is to punish greedy conjurer mages for splitting exclusively 8 cost giants. Prior to him there was absolutely no downside to it. The other day I was playing against some mage. I think I was rogue, def wasn't shaman, but somehow I had a big Hagatha's scheme in hand.  
---
Mage dropped khadgar, killed a minion with a giant and then split it into 4 more. 2 Octosaris came up. I could feel him grinning until I cleared the whole board for a 16 card draw, instant kill. So satisfying.
---
They don't care about wild buddy. Welcome to Hearthstone

---
Discover and random are completely different. If the hero power were actually glyph I'd wager it'd be competitive - maybe not tier 1 but competitive.
---
I stopped buying into the game with Rhatsakan. I've been buying bundles and pre-orerds since WotG and realized with the legendaries and nerfs that Blizzard creates an unstable environment for anyone that wants to put actual money into it. It's been hard to break from the game and not buy in, but I got tired of seeing my money tossed aside and an entire archetype of a deck disappear over night. As it is now, I can play two classes. If Blizz whacks one of those, I have another deck to climb with. If shit happens, as it has before, and I lose two decks, then I play my dailies for the gold and wait for the next expansion. Its a rigged game and I would advise stop spending now because you'll feel better on the next one when you pass on it.
---
People won’t figure this out until hsreplay does it for them.
---
I swear netdecking removes like 90% of the skill required to play a card game.
---
Discover a spell or a "pick a mystery" choice
---
It's worded right.
---
LOL
---
Alright thanks for clearing that up for me just looks sort of weird
---
What hero power is worse than Shaman? I thought it was universally agreed it was the worst.
---
So I'm guessing psychopomp should be used to rez the big dudes, meaning that as far as minions go it's vargoth for early game, sandhoof, and board clears / healing. Sounds like fun
---
I used it in lackey zoo. Won me a few games with the 2 damage lackey.
---
Yeah im just mostly afraid of some type of nerf. i used to play original shudderwock and that got nerfed to extinction.
---
Anduin says WOW
---
I think you are right. My YouTube polls confirm your opinion. According to my data, a record low number of players made a pre-order this time.
---
Bit l8 m8
---
&gt;hey this card is a really good counter to control warrior
---
&gt;I dusted it so cw is still broken
---
It took me a moment to consider why this is bad, lol. I'm not actually sure what quests are worth stealing come to think of it.
---
I prefer to call it the youtube app on android
---
you really think so? Well that's a shame. I prefer to see them try to buff cards that were meaningless before and make them decent. IT CAN BE DONE I have faith that the people at Blizzard are competent
---
Ah right, just noticed this lmao
---
"getting to turn 10 is a miracle these days".
---
You must be really new to this game. The last metas we got were probably the slower ones.
---
During years the only way to play was to think "how will I beat aggro?"...
---
You two need to stop bickering and GO TO YOUR ROOM
---
&gt;and the Nomi last hope would also be brawled or warpathed.
---
I'm not arguing that it isn't a bad matchup -- I'm just pointing out (by question) that Nomi can't really be addressed by warpath, unless they have 12 mana, or a board full of 1/1s at the start of their turn
---
that was the cost of changing scandalous art and many important changes in management
---
Gun = good.
---
Video juegos = bad.
---
Praise corporate. Profit margins to the left.

it happened to me too vs control warrior I closed the game and when I entered I found out that i had won the match xd

Isn't Walmart one of the biggest distributor of guns? The hypocrisy is through the roof with this one.

I thought he just wears a suit which makes him act mechanical?
---
Turns out 15 health is kinda a lot especially since it is hard to guarantee it happening. Your opponent isn't going to leave damaged minions on board for you to heal. If it's a combo deck, they might not even damage your hero very much. 
---
The reward is worth trying though. I think it will just take the right meta game where you can heal reliably
---
Drop a decklist please?
---
The classic set is designed to be the most powerful set on purpose
---
Paladin was mine too! Loved control pali back in the day.
---
Oh yes I know that feeling and because it's a 60 gold quest it feels so bad to reroll as well... This might sound dumb but I think keeping it until next week's brawl might be there way to go.
---
Give your enemy an upgraded hero power.
---
Which makes a lot of new cards obsolete.
---
I'm fine sitting on my 60 until Wednesday but yeah this isnt a good design
---
I’m not claiming these things “shouldn’t” be added to the game. But since your question is regarding my personal thoughts on the matter, I can say unequivocally that I truly do not give a shit about these types of updates never coming. I’m just here to ladder.
---
I spend $0.00 on this game.  In 64ish packs I opened King Phaoris, Pally quest, golden Dark Pharaoh Tekahn (may disenchant once I'm done getting SoU packs), and got the priest quest for my freebie.  I've been stockpilling dust for a while now and I crafted my missing peices to do mech paladin, doing ok with it.  Normally I play Shaman, but I didn't get any of the new cool shaman epics/legendaries.  
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I kinda wish I had bought that wild deal a while back.  I may spend money in the future, as I'm playing more and more now, but I refuse to spend anything close to $1.00 per pack.  Maybe economics and whales/people who will spend w/e no mater what dictate that they make the most money this way, but I think far more people would buy packs if they were @ $0.25 a pack.  I also think a flat price, like $120.00, for every card in an expansion would sell well and please a lot of people (still ridiculously expensive for *one* expansion).
---
Deck code? I have brann so I'll probably have to make a lot of changes
---
Rag isn't in standard any more, he's had a massive pay cut.
---
Where did you get data on sales/ profits between expansions?
---
Discover a spell or pick a mistery choice would be the perfect wording. The way it's worded right now sounds awful. I agree with you OP
---
It's not worded right as long as the text doesn't have "
---
I dont think lens needs to be touched at all personaly .
---
And mana cyclone loosing elemental tag is lot better nerf then 4mana 4/4 that would keep card usable but weaker instead of basiclly useless in deck.
---
That assumes that you have most, if not all of the cards from previous expansions and the classic set. Many players don't, especially if they are F2P.
---
That's how us free-to-play folk can't do well without investing extensive amounts of time...
---
The only constant in life is change. 
---
So, appreciate the things you like while they are happening.
---
Same for me, i usually got the druid one, now i got warlock, i dont think i even played a game of warlock in this las expac, and i have like 30 druid wins total with over 10k wins with other classes so... I think its just random
---
There are x2 Eggs and x2 Whelps. There is also Kangor's Army that will likely get you 2 eggs/whelps and 1 7/7 or 8/8. Are you saying that it is enough? Even if they break the eggs/whelps immediately as you put them down?  
---
The problem is that you have 4 threats in the entire deck and the Warrior has enough time to recover between the waves of 7/7s and 8/8s.  
---
The rest of your deck doesn't pressure Warrior enough for him to spend any actual removal.  
---
But perhaps you're right. I still don't like Quest Paladin because you have to run the quest and at least 10 reborn cards (which are ranging from okay to utter garbage), then there are the 4 threats which leaves 15 slots to stuff in all the auto-include cards. I feel like you end up cutting important cards so you can complete the quest sooner which hurts the matchups.
---
Comparing it to piloted shredder, both are goblins operating a mech.
---
 So technically they could both be mechs in the "WoW world"
---
I think maybe they should just the Twinspell off of CC. The biggest issue I see with CC is that you can already start with the potential to have 4 copies of the card, + the chance to get another 2 from random card generation.
---
I agrre with hof of giant, and a hof aslo means its almost guaranteed to never get nerfed eiter(which we need less of in classic/basic sets)
---
Someone posted a pic of the card back which basically was the same as the RoS one (obtainable by completing it), based on this and the answer they gave at the last reddit Q&amp;A I am GUESSING it is gonna follow the same pay-to-play model.  I would save gold if I were you if you plan on getting it.  Hopefully it will be free or cheaper though - but I doubt it.
---
You're better off going without the quest in most decks. Starting off with 1 less card than your opponent and having to jump through hoops to heal 15 health is harder than just going for your win condition from the start
---
Activision earning calls.
---
While this is true, I'm finding it more often than not that I'm tossing away a deadly shot or dire frenzy I could utilize for big board removal and resource regeneration later in the game for an immediate Unleash the Hounds
---
Maybe the RNG gods haven't been with me but I'm looking at the card as more of a hindrance at the moment
---
Also, giving up on the "pick a mistery" part would look like "discover a spell or a choice". Sounds wrong aswell
---
He can still disagree with that way of counting.
---
The rogue deck is okay but I think it's more than just skill it's a lot of luck too, if you keep getting crappy decks in a row (such as the warlock one which is fun but just dies vs a lot of decks) it is frustrating and pointless.
---
I accidentally played Naga Sea Witch with the coin still in my hand, but it ended up winning me the game with an extra 5-mana minion.
---
\#justhsthings
---
Yes but the focus of the card Piloted Shredder isn’t the pilot, it’s the shredder. Otherwise the card could be called “Shredder Pilot”, which would then not be a mech.
---
Oh got it thanks
---
What do you mean? It's a classic example of Divine Spirit combo. The goal is to stick a minion, buff it with PW:S / Extra Arms, then double its health with Divine Spirit, cast Inner Fire (or flip stats with Topsy Turvy) and often kill the opponent.
---
E.g. you play Injured Blademaster with Circle of healing on T3, then on T4 you play Shield (9 health), Divine Spirit (18 health), Inner Fire and hit for 18. If your opponent can't answer it (and lots of meta decks can't), then you win next turn. 
---
You can also win by simply sticking Amet and buffing his health. Even a single Divine Spirit on Amet means that your minions will now come out with 14 health, and that's also very hard to kill for most decks, so you end up with an unkillable board (and then either slowly hit them or also play Inner Fire / Turvy if you have it to speed up the process).
---
Phaoris is the only minion in your deck, and when you play Prismatic Lens, it'll draw Phaoris and another spell and swap their costs... So you'll end up with a cheaper Phaoris and a 10-cost spell, making Phaoris much stronger when you play him. He makes crazier board states on turn 4-5 than Tip the Scales... And with a Rebuke just before, impossible to address the board. 
---
Even if it's not consistent, I'm not sure Team 5 is happy to see Prismatic Lens making all these crazy boards so early in the game... I won't be surprised at all to see Prismatic Lens changed pretty soon.
---
A classic case of "read the card"
---
Still fine, hero power is always there when needed.
---
Well played, sir!
---
Not glowing 🍊
---
You also have the 1/1 tokens from Snip Snap. And in many cases, you finish quest and make copies of micro mummy to force them to answer your board. 
---
Annoy-o-module is actually great if it comes back un-magnetized with Kangor's. You just want big taunts to stay alive. I think it can work much better if you squeeze in a bronze gatekeeper.
---
Hooktusk is better tho. Quest rogue has been pretty underwhelming so far
---
&gt;It looks like this is still at the top of the meta after 4 months and 2 expansions
---
Nah, that's Hunter
---
But if the deck is nerfed, Elysiana might become worthless and be a poor craft long term, thats why he's asking
---
Nah, it’s cause it does nothing the turn of.
---
Maybe grow a brain stem?

Which is exactly how that wording always works
---
Honestly only remember people flaming the decision to cut adventures.
---
multiply by 10 and we've got some rewards.
---
Hearthstone doesn't reward you for spending money on the game. They don't care about people who would like to spend a few bucks here and there. They want the whales and the f2p. They improve the f2p so that they can still have a large playerbase and then they increase the cost of having a lot of different decks(increase pack cost, make 2 legendary per class) to suck the most money out of the whales. On a short term point of view (wich is the only one that matter in modern capitalism) this is the most profitable way of monetizing the game and the best business model. Who cares if that makes players like me not play the game anymore and only watch streamers playing? They would make less money if they tried to apeal to me.
---
That’s why I’ve decided to only purchase pre order bundles and never bulk packs. £80 for an expansion every 4 months is at least somewhat decent for me at least and I don’t feel very guilty doing it, but besides that I just save. I’ve got 800 gold already just grinding off quests and daily win bonuses so I should be good for around 60 packs next exp.
---
Surprised that it isn't too. Straight up upgrade to hero power by restoring 3 up from 2, and give a minion +3/+3. Thats almost a blessing of kings every turn. But completing it is surprisingly hard.
---
Which makes a solid Control Deck so satisfying to play.  Almost as satisfying as knowing that once you beat someone they're going to go post 3 "DR. BOOM OP, BLIZ NERF PLZ" threads.

Don't run plague. Tekahn is nutty.
---
Hearthstone revenue is broken out from the rest of Activision in these calls? Surprising.
---
Imagine thinking Luna's Pocket Galaxy isn't good enough to be used in the proper Mage Deck.
---
Hey it's still better than the other Fyre festival. People spent thousands of dollars and didnt even get to meet ja-rule
---
I run it because I also run the 7 mana 6/8 that resummons minions that died.
---
Why are people still propping up this soulless shell of what was once a great company. Cut the blizzavision tie already and move on to mtgarena.
---
&gt;SN1P-SN4P everyone got for free is the second most played card in Standard right now
---
Anyway you look at this, it's sad. 1. They didn't know it was that good. 2. They did know, and they still released it to warp the game. 3. Everybody has to play the fucking crab even if you don't like it.
---
&gt;Furthermore, Genn and Baku rotation awarded from as little as 3200 dust for free
---
OMG I'm dying. Do they pay you to say this shit? You got the dust back, it wasn't a gift. But more importantly, it removed a dozen competitive decks that people had invested dust in from the game.
---
This expansion so far seems to favour decks with a lot of legendaries. So yeah, dust is feeling a tad limited right now.
---
But
---
&gt;Spending 80€ gives me almost 2 full fledged games with nothing more I need to spend on and having hours and hours of fun..
---
As for that\^,  I've spent maybe $150 on Hearthstone since 2014 and its gotten me far more hours than any 'full fledged game'. I'd prefer to get thousands of hours out of hearthstone than maybe a 100 out of something like the Witcher or God of War then never touch it again.
---
I don't think needing boom would do much to the deck. I think needing elekk or the weapon would do more to address the problem. I also think conjurer's calling should be up for consideration, but that's another conversation
---
I’m fairly certain if you just add Luna’s to any deck it’s not gonna go well for you
---
I'm not seeing Plague of Flames played in zoo decks on HSreplay. Losing your own minions is devastating for Zoo. I suppose you could tech it, but you're probably better off not. 
---
In terms of Tekahn, some decks don't run him. I think some people find it too slow in a deck that is all about playing tons of minions. It's up to you.
---
I personally don't think there is too much antisynergy between Tekahn and Evil Recruiter. You can definitely run both and not just one or the other. Several reasons:
---
- Evil Recruiter is great if you haven't drawn Tekahn yet 
---
- After playing Tekahn, you can trade in your 4/4 lackeys then Evil Recruiter essentially heals the Lackey and gives it +1/+1
---
- simply upgrading a 4/4 lackey into a 5/5 is still good. It makes Evil Recruiter a 3 Mana 4/4 in total stats, which is still strong
---
-VALUE
---
So take what you will from that lol. I hope this helps even if only a little.
---
&gt; There's no magical forcefield that makes the gun vanish when you cross state lines.
---
Unfortunately. Back in the day it was incredibly time-consuming to move from place to place. "State right's" in the time period of the founding fathers made sense when most folk would live their entire life and die in the same couple mile stretch they were born in. If you were a stranger from out of town you'd stick out like a sore thumb. That's no longer the world we live in. And you're never going to erect barriers between states because it would be disruptive to commerce (and $$$ is king)... the only real solution is to treat the country as a single unit with federal level legislation.
---
Zephyrs only offers cards from basic and classic sets
---
&gt; is there is a much larger pool of viable legendaries
---
you mean Genn and Baku??
---
oh right, there where nerfed cause people hating playing this game where 2 legendaries where so strong that you only needed 1 of them and a few epics to have the strongest deck in the meta.
---
Keep playing the game. Show them that even if they give zero rewards, we will keep playing! /s
---
I was playing against a bomb warrior and got so mad that I shot up a supermarket. Violent video games are the root of all fathomable evils
---
lmao some guy on facebook just stole your post
---
I love this new mecha thun deck. The conditions are super easy to meet and the quest is insane. I’ve beaten a lot of control warriors with this
---
I told myself I would stop pre-ordering if they kept up this shit. They've kept it up and I stopped pre-ordering late 2018.
---
They haven't earned my money back, and in fact I'm thinking about just jumping out completely. I feel like I can't play anything fun unless I drop a few hundred on the cards.
---
This should work:

Besides murloc paladin it is pretty much going to be in every highlander decks (decks that run a single copy of all cards with no duplicates, or cards that run some duplicates but rapidly cycle through their deck, eg meca'thun warloc in wild or murloc pally in standard).  Highlander decks are always expensive since they run a lot of legendaries.  
---
That said it is safe long term especially if you play wild and wanna play reno decks in wild.  Otherwise I'd wait if you don't have the cards to make at least one highlander deck now.  It will always be played in any reno deck in wild.
---
They don't give specifics during the calls, but you can get a pretty good idea of how well/poorly an expansion is performing based on how they talk about player retention vs previous expansions, how well the expansions performing, etc. There was a pretty good post on this subreddit a few days ago that went in to explaining what the call meant for hearthstone in better detail than I ever could. There are usually plenty of youtube videos that explore it too.
---
This is not true though lmfao
---
The meta is not stable yet. That's it.
---
I'm still grateful every day for no adventures.
---
It *forced* you to pay, if you wanted to unlock some random 5 star common that was key to every single deck.
---
Spirit claws for example. That card was 100% required for shaman, but could I just get it for 80 dust? Nope! Had to save up 3k gold or shell out real money. For a common.
---
They locked free to play players out of the meta. It was horrible.
---
No. I like the meta and new cards. Warrior and Mage obviously need a nerf but everything else is fine.
---
There's nothing to stop them from including 135 cards in an adventure, just adjust the cost accordingly.
---
Obviously the lootbox mechanics are far more profitable, the "few cards" excuse is a convenient one that somehow people continue to parrot.
---
DerpyDolphin#2900 Eu 80g quest trade
---
I bought 130 packs and bought 33 with my gold. Total of 166 packs. I received a total of 830 cards and disenchanted 579. Having only 251 cards is kinda insane and i’m still missing a hell of a lot of cards.
---
Now you're just trying to turn a conversation into a confrontation. I'm not "trying to be right". I just thought the notion that doing full expansions being controversial was odd because that's what everyone wanted in the first place. It's a completely different point because it was never supposed to be commentary on the first point anyway, I felt the conversation had naturally moved onto a different topic.
---
I mean, no shit it does, you have to basically pass 3-4 turns at the start to get the effect
---
"Wow..."
---
[NA] Have quest. Add me. TheAcer#1931
---
You must go first. I'll show.
---
Yeah, well, good minions are quite often just good minions.
---
It's not even the first time Contol and Aggro has played the same sort of minions. Tar Creeper and Stonehill Defender are two easy examples.
---
Plus, most lists of Aggro Warrior only overlap with Control Warrior on only three or four minions, Eritium Rover (a one mana 1/3, great tempo), SN1P-SN4P (a highly flexable card at all possible mana costs), and the rush pair of Restess Mummy and Militia Commander (really good and strong removal tools). That's not really that much.
---
Control warrior will not be played competitively post nerf  is the intent. Not sure the one mana increase is enough to pull that off though
---
Could be. I do have pretty bad luck in HS though. I track my opening of packs every expansion and average a legendary every 36 packs.
---
&gt;  You need to prevent those from happening
---
Uhh... no. You can't prevent them. You literally cannot prevent people from killing other people. People will find a way to kill each other. But you're certainly much better off if fat fuck Bob the Plumber, an out of shape right wing asshole can't kill three dozen people with his AR-15 modified with over the counter parts to fully automatic fire. 
---
"Mental Health" is a fucking meme. It's a god damn meme. You can't and literally don't want the government regulating people's head space (how the fuck do people not see the irony of whining about thought crimes while advocating for the legislation of thought crimes). 
---
People have been killing each other for thousands of years and will continue to do so for the foresee future. What you need to do is throw up barriers that make it difficult for some college drop-out or disgruntled mid-lifer to rack up a high score with commercially available products.
---
I don't think that would be enough to kill it from competitive
---
Definition of insanity right here
---
I had to check the name to make sure that wasn't me. Did that a couple days ago lol.
---
This is also why I took Naga Sandwich out of the deck
---
It's Yogg's favorite toy, no wonder it's doing wonders.
---
Well thats the thing. Either you do all quests every day or you have to spend/lose wild cards to keep up.
---
The game has to be expensive because 
---
1) it is addicting
---
2) it is the main profit source for blizzard's other projects. (especially prior to overwatch's release and whole lootbox thing)
---
I've not played wild since it was released and a guy on this sub said it was a good place. I took his word for it and it was a refreshing experience.  Whilst not impressive it was a nice change
---
Step 1. Craft whizbang
---
Step 2. ???
---
Step 3. Profit
---
At least they didn’t show Blackhowl Gunspire on board 😐
---
Too bad the best tools are in Wild.
---
Yep, seems like the entire CCG thing may have just been a fad in esports.  But as you said, there's little direct relationship between viewership and playerbase.
---
So you ignore their value completely in giving the "bottom line"?
---
Some people are smart and expect 6-10 free packs throughout the lifespan of an expansion and will save their pity timer accounting for them - which means these "old packs" may very well contain MORE value than a "new pack".
---
Throughout the course of an expansion if you do your daily quest every day you'll get 8000-10000 gold. Any free packs on top of that has the same value you're suggesting "old packs" have. I don't think it's fair to put "new packs" on a pedestal like that since in all reality they don't have any more or less value than old expansion packs.
---
The average pack opened for dust is 100 dust (there is some contention on this number, but the accuracy only further drives my point home). It can then be said 100g *=* 100 dust. It would be far more valuable to standardize your calculations to a standard currency with a well defined value. Like you said, gold is the most valuable resource and in 2019 I got ~1500g and 2017 I got ~1600g. Not too bad of a deal.
---
I would be happy with a match history. There are 3rd party sites and apps you can use to get stats and stuff. Why would lazy dev spend time on that when 3rd party sites do it for them. 
---
What do you mean by tourney mode? Random 8 people play in a bracket...um isnt that kinda like arena?
---
So, in the end, omega is not that Op /s.
---
NA, as if I were to find that match so annoying I'd prefer decks that beat Control Warrior.
---
Was that Emmeris to double KK’s stats?
---
Tempo bursts are sometimes better than consistent tempo
---
I still get excited. The way I stay exited is playing in moderation. I do my daily’s and grind a little bit besides that I don’t play much. As soon as I’m not full buzzed to que for a game I stop playing, and pick up later when I’m ready to play.
---
We still don't have the 10 gold per 3 wins in Arena either
---
I think dust system is punishing example: legendary cost: 1,600 disenchant: 400 :/ it’s like they are punishing you.
---
That’s wild
---
Luckily the one in the picture is clearly the post nerf version!
---
Any deck with sustain and card generation is great against control warrior.
---
Well at rank 10 I don't really see that much control warriors, 2 most prominent decks are quest druid and quest shaman.
---
First time I didn’t preorder.
---
He's a fuul.
---
This is why I have been loving Dota underlords
---
Do you mean the cards we have to spend $50+ dollars on to get any decent collection from? The ones that come after months of no updates? The ones that are mainly pack filler?
---
You mean the adventures that have been rehashed over and over again...that we have to pay for?
---
The card system would be a lot better if it was like Gwent's. Get your 4 random cards and have 3 options to choose from for your 5th card. (Like a discover.)
---
I use my phone 24/7 during those matchups and even then I am bored to death
---
Started playing quest paladin to crush them but it’s still boring because I am guaranteed a win yet they keep reSiSTING
---
Yup. 
---
 
---
https://i.redd.it/vt36cbb4dnf31.jpg
---
Funny thing is the saviors of uldum didn’t really add anything to control warrior to make it that more powerful.
---
They didn't force you to pay. You could unlock each wing for 700 gold each. It was tedious, but that's how I beat blackrock mountain.
---
The Dumpster. It's a sub for dotards. It's been quarantined by reddit for promoting violence. Dude still posts there anyways.
---
Exactly you have to dust 4 legendaries to get one new one, it’s absurd.
---
It is not just warrior that is a problem. I spend 80€ and can't play what I want as 5 classes are unplayable.
---
So I need to spend 80€, have 50 cards missing from expansion (ALOT of legendaries), cant play 5/9 classes as they are shit and have to copy paste decks from net if I want to win anything close to 50% of games....
---
Is it so hard to balance? I mean there can't be ever true balance but this is sucking FUN out of the game completly. This is shit game.
---
You're right, that was a personal opinion but my phrasing made it sound like a fact. My bad
---
I saw it, then forgot about it until it was too late. rip. Had to craft it haha.
---
Chill? What do you mean ? XD I only try to change the card without destroy it. Maybe you think that this effect is powerful but in wild is one of the few options warrior has to gain vs the infinite value decks and combo deck that are all over the ladder . Your argument is “ if this card have the same effect will be powerful too” what ? Are you serious?  And I dont care if you hate me XD and pls keep for your self the response telling me I’m salty. The change that Blizzard make will be fine to me but I hope it will be better than “ take away this “
---
&gt; They gave up because they wanted to focus on other updates that make easy money
---
FTFY.
---
Theres no answer that would satisfy people so they just dont comment. Its pretty normal with how bloodthirsty gaming communities are now.
---
Yea, I was pretty desperate for healing and chose priest... But ideally either Jaina or guldan would have won me
---
That's another problem. If this was the issue, why don't they tell us? Why keep us in the dark about their engine limitations?
---
Their communication is terribly lacking
---
You're just wrong. You didn't have to spend a penny to get the adventures, you could buy every single wing with gold. And saving the 2800/3500 gold necessary for it was (and is, people still save gold in between expansions, now it's just worth even less) easy. It was much more accessible in every way. You could argue, and I give you that, that they didn't shake up the meta much or very long sometimes, but speaking strictly about costs it was a much, much better deal for players and especially free to play players as they didn't have to spend anything and could still get all of the cards.
---
 Tyrande and khagdar false promises
---
Except lyra can roll with 1 spell and use the spells it generates on the go, cyclone can't. Sorry but mana cyclone is really not a problem at all.
---
Cuz Blizzard are greedy cunts. Just look at how much money you have to spend to get a decent amount of legendarys and epics to play around with.
---
When people have somehow forgot this glorious meme
---
I stopped playing because it feels like they keep pumping in new cards. 
---
I started after a more than a year pause and barely had my new deck and then they come with yet another expansion. 
---
Is it possible to be successful without paying money? Yes
---
Is it fun? 
---
No
---
Snip Snap and Card Buffs is a very complicated theme. On the one hand, it is something new and definitely interesting. This is the right decision of the developers. But on the other hand, this makes the game again more expensive for new players and for players who have few resources. New players will not receive Snip Snap for free, Luna's Pocket Galaxy now is an important card for players who like Mage. 
---
It may seem not essential, but add to this not free adventures and the high level of influence of the legendary cards from Rise of Shadows. All these minor nuances have significantly affected the balance of the game resources. All this makes the game even more expensive for free-2-play players.
---
The only way 'vote with your wallet' will have any effect is if you can get tens of thousands of people to all follow suit at the same time.
---
Thankfully Thrall did us the favor of killing him in a PG-13 way.
---
What do you mean? We just got two free heroes with the preorder and the latest bundle :)  
---
^^^/s
---
&gt; My issue isn't me spending 300 euros my issue is spending 300 euros on an expansion and still not having a FULL COLLECTION. And this is somehow deemed the NORM and ACCEPTABLE which it totally is not.
---
you need to understand that blizzard is a company, they don't know nor give a fuck about what you think it's acceptable. All they see from you is that you are willing to pay for their product at the current pricing model. You can do whatever you want with your money but as long as there's people like you, droping 300 bucks on an expansion it doesn't matter how you feel or how much people complain on reddit, nothing will change.
---
The features I want are new mechanics and interesting decks. The devs give me those to the tune of three expansions a year.
---
So no, I'm good, thanks.
---
Meanwhile, Japanese gacha games shower you with free shit and still breaks profit records year after year.
---
Stadler#1396, trading 80g quest, I'll show and you go first
---
Why? People are still playing just the same as on rank. Just take the 10g away for winning three games, then make the winner's pot out of that. Tournament losers should get nothing, but asking them to pay for their failure is a bit much.
---
mtga added a cat and a battle pass before the friendlist and a filter for the new cards in the collection LUL
---
The double trigger is v hard to come back from, very powerful..
---
Of course they do when it's a trend
---
Okay? What's better, a game with no features that does the bare minimum and is still successfully getting people's money, or a dead game that struggles to get money and eventually dies off?
---
I'd much prefer the latter. I don't understand why people act like "lack of revenue" leading to a game getting "greedier" is a bad thing. It just means you (This and all subsequent uses of "you" are general, not specific to the person I'm replying to) have more reason to leave. If you feel a game is flawed enough that you want it to change, particularly if you dislike how greedy it's gotten, the implication in my mind is that crying for change means you're okay with the game dying off.
---
If you're not okay with a game potentially shutting down because of lack of revenue, then you are legitimately spineless in my eyes and you need to shut the fuck up. "BUH MUH VIDYA GAME" isn't an excuse for complaining about shitty developer/publisher practices and then continuing to play anyway. There's plenty of games out there, if one is flawed just ditch it and move on.

Building your deck around completing the quest asap will weaken your deck far more than putting pocket galaxy and random big idiots. Best case scenario for druid was like a turn 6 quest completion, turn 7 actually playing barnabus.

https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Design_and_development_of_Hearthstone
---
Hearthstone was initially conceived as a PC game, due to Blizzard being primarily focused on this platform. However, **fairly early in development, in response to the growing popularity of games on mobile devices, the team realised that the game could work well on a mobile platform, and later committed to this as a specific goal.**
---
**Once the team had decided that the game would be released for mobile devices such as iPad, the developers were forced to assess aspects such as interface design with this eventual goal in mind.** For example, features intended to be discovered through mouse-over had to made with an alternate mobile-friendly interaction in mind, in order to ensure that it was possible to later make a mobile version of the game that was intuitive and easy to use, while still matching the game's PC version.  **Because this goal was kept in mind through the development process, relatively little redesign was necessary for mobile release.**
---
Because you need a healthy playerbase of low paying or F2P people for the whales to interact with and crush.
---
F2P games (even ones like hearthstone that heavily encourage paying some money) live and die by whales. A whale easily spends $400+ per expansion getting all the cards. Call it 1500$ a year, buying the cards, adventures, and new heros.
---
The average player spends what? Including the many F2P players the average has to be sub 50$, probably more like 10-20$ on average.
---
Those numbers are even more radically different for gacha games. We're talking whales spending $500+ *per month* while the majority of players are completely F2P.
---
The whales don't stick around though unless they have people to crush with their pay 2 win content, so keeping the F2P players happy is very important to keeping the whales around. You also need a large enough population to keep the F2P players around, since if they only play whales they'll quit. 
---
So while it not make sense at first glance, sometimes giving away lots of content to players can make you the most profit. It helps "wet the whistle" of players who aren't sure if they want to spend money on the game by giving them a taste of what they would get, while keeping the F2P playerbase healthy to support the whales.
---
I love whizbang so I thought zayle would just be more whizbang decks with a different theme. Its not. Its just worse than whizbang, I literally never won even a single game with zayle decks, even at rank 25. Even those decks I did play just were not fun. I'm not sure if there was a super tiny pool of decks, but I played about 10 games with Zayle (lost all of them) and only played about 3 different, awful decks.
---
Welcome to F2P life my dude
---
I wonder if the next expansion will make or break hearthstone
---
I get if it was dusting extras, but an entire collection? In 2 years you are already guaranteed 6 legends from the free one in first 10 packs of each expansion.  And im sure thats more than enough
---
Turns out that if you don't significantly improve a game for 6 years its playerbase declines.....who knew?
---
An inconsistent entity you can always trust to be inconsistent. Its the consistent ones you have to worry about...they could turn at any moment!
---
The messenger pops are annoying
---
Pff I’m saving as we speak
---
oh yeah, its big brain time
---
Yeah, I had about 10 legends. You need to dust 4 legends to get enough for one.
---
Lmfao
---
I know this was a joke, but even that doesn't work, because coin at 10 mana doesn't give you 11 mana.
---
But then you're forced to buy the content.
---
Beoken overall, warrior and mech are OP currently
---
You deserve an upvote since you are playing warlock, May I please have your deck code
---
Wow, Radiance looks a lot better knowing this.
---
I agree, I just think people are mistaken on what the outcome will be. They think a boycott will lead to investment by blizzard; it won't.
---
Sap them I play a similar deck I'll drop the list if you want
---
After Dog Hafu and Toast quit HS i knew theres something fishy going on, i bet they knew who this will end up.
---
Do cards shifting to wild give you more dust for disenchant?
---
I know i was joking, that's my problem with quest.
---
Rogue doesn't have tools anymore to play the long game and quest is only good for control/value deck.
---
All you can do is to play aggressively and have lethal from hand by the time they set up their taunts and eggs. In this case you shouldn't be playing quest at all
---
Your mechs with charge have 1+ attack
---
20 bucks for 45 guaranteed cards, lots of them being great and most of them being good.
---
Or 20 bucks for a bunch of packs, you'd have to get anyways and they don't offer anything new since they come a whole month after the expansion released, and a single legendary that is beyond weak.
---
You decide which is the better deal....
---
His +7 armor is more than regular +2 armor. His 3 1/1 mechs with rush is better than paladin hero power. Deal 3 damage is better than hunter deal 2 to face. And 1 damage to all enemy minions i guess can be comparable to rogue 1/2 weapon. Every hero power is op, and lets not forget the passive then mechs have rush.
---
1.
---
I don't get people complaining about rogues, freeze mages, otks and resurrect priests and don't complain about warriors.
---
Thanks
---
actually i play wild, control warrior isnt really a huge problem there. just thought i’d offer an idea on how to change it since it’s pretty strong in standard, but hey whatever you say
---
Taunts? The 2/2 and the legendary are freaking huge. Now he lost the last weakness he had, which is early game presence.
---
Whats the first hp?
---
When did the buff to gold rewards occur exactly to compensate for this?
---
yeah its a bummer. However i recently picked up mgta and ive never felt more in the hole cards wise its terrrrrrible. i would hate to see hs get that bad
---
Then why gradually reduce the free shit every xpac for hearthstone?
---
One issue is even you complete the quest, there isn't a solid win con. Converting your deck to random Legs and only be able to draw one every turn isn't enough. The quest may be worth it if there's some game winning combo that you can pull off after quest completion.
---
grats
---
All systems are flawed democracy is no differnet, especially when there are various forms of it.
---
Mobilizing a community to take such an action is impossible. The only hope is for someone at T5 to give enough of a shit as to make it happen.
---
Creative Achievements would be really cool IMO. I think I’ve seen them say they don’t want people queueing with decks meant to complete an achievement instead of to win which is fair.  But I’d expect most players to queue janky decks in casual and you already have the old all Murloc or weapon deck created just to complete a quest.
---
Energy Drink. I have one a day.
---
I also don't drink coffee or soda which means that single energy drink is my only source of liquid caffeine.
---
From an hours of entertainment standpoint per dollar standpoint, Hearthstone is very cost efficient for me.
---
Great now they're gonna change the art again. At least hopefully they'll keep more of the tiddies this time. Tiddies dont make kids shoot up schools
---
I LOVE how metal this card is!!!!
---
As a control warrior, I call shenanigans on all of this crizznap.
---
Lol.... Absolutely lol..
---
You think you want these features, but you don't.
---
Don't even try. Former Blizzard fanboi ever since I've been on that incredible ride of frozen throne back in 2003. People defending Acti$$ard to this extend nowadays are kids that maybe played the latest two WoW expansions and think it's the rr greatest shit ever. I don't even want to lessen their experience and hype, but sit down a minute and listen to the people that have been around this Company and it's shitty practices for over a decade....
---
Come to wild. Your cards wont expire there.
---
Current #1 Legend in EU played the deck to get there. Have seen some others in top 100 also playing it.
---
I *HAVE* time for games...
---
Exactly. You have players like Kibler who buy shit tons of packs to be able to afford full golden decks. He may be a high profile streamer but there are many other anonymous players acting the same. Sinking loads of cash into an unoptimised poorly supported game.
---
With the scope of potential HS has it is still in the state you would have expected at launch.
---
Hunter quest is hot garbage most of the time as you need many turns to get it done and most other quests can be done by turn 6
---
Wow this card art is INSANE!!!
---
Dr Boom doesn't need a nerf because it's not a powerful card. It was not even played when death knights with actual win conditions were around. Dr Booms problem is it's an OK value generator in a limited format.
---
Most important non of these features give profit to Activision Blizzard, this isnt your oldschool Blizzard, so dont except these features anytime soon..
---
lemme restart then, 1 sec
---
So you’re hating on the expansion while playing the best win rate/ most oppressive deck? I’m so lost bro
---
I was surprised there is only 1 quest that give you 1 pack.... I have only managed to get 5 packs fpr the new expansion , literally cannot play ranked.
---
They should be illegal, it's disgusting.
---
"a chance" - you are guaranteed to participate in lootbox gambling. Hell, if there was a chance I wouldn't have to participate and just got the cards I wanted, maybe I'd consider it.
---
Hearthstone is clearly just a cash cow, it's the whole business model of the game. There are no desires for it to expand or develop because those efforts are better recieved in things like WoW Classic or OW
---
This doesn't mean you can't enjoy it, but unfortunately, (especially with the theme piggybacking off WoW) the whole point of the game is clearly to produce maximum income for minimum effort.
---
The only way this will change is if people stop buying packs, which some will always continue to do.
---
Watched a video online its confirmed that he gives you pact or at least it did in the video
---
If I had gotten this quest before I did my free run that would have been great.  But I didn't, so I rerolled it.
---
Control warrior has answers to everything you throw at them, if you're going tall, if you're going wide, if you're going face with a weapon (weapons project, nice !). The only card they really need to win is Dr.Boom. Rest of the deck is just massive cockblock and stall. 
---
I auto conceded a lot of games against Warr recently, just not bothered to play against it
---
I played the Uther death knight
---
We really need to expose these kind of cashgrab, otherwise blizzard is not going to do anything
---

Just do like me, move to mtg arena lol
---
The game is much more fun, the meta is extremely diversed, there are much crazier cards, the game is much more interactive (like, you can play cards on your oponent's turn) AND the game is more f2p friendly. Even the draft ("arena" in HS) have a MUCH better mechanic to pick up cards (for me that's huge because I used to play a LOT of arena in hs). And WotC listen a lot to the community (the only move they tried to do that wasn't f2p friendly, people complained and they reverted it). So yeah I think it's very worth it.
---
I still follow this sub tho, I like it
---
&gt; crispycurium
---
whats your id
---
The 2 meanings are a literal physical sting and the pain of losing something. This is a pun...
---
   Mmo
---
I’d usually say keep your legendaries u!til you’re done purchasing a set but in this case it’s a golden useless one. That 1 for 1 value, and 100% worth the disenchant even if you happen to get him again.
---
So yes dust him, keep him he second time if you happen to get him again
---
People still preorder $80 packs and spend hundreds more each expansion. Idk why people still support this.
---
Token Druid like 50 dust.
---
My guy, yes they did lol. Armagedillo on two Tomb Wardens and any other taunts generated through Dr. Boom or Shaggy. Note that this Tomb Wardens can also rush and you can discover more. Oh, and let's not forget Restless Mummy which is way better than Militia Commander.
---
Most baller card imo
---
This is the reverse of that Loatheb post the other day.
---
You ever try to play control warrior into a wall of taunt minions that get 3/3 every time the priest hits the button? I'm so dead bro
---
And over 50% of the viewers are for a single streamer. Today, Thjis had 20k viewers - while Hearthstone at max had 35k.
---
This is why I don't accept friends requests after any game.
---
I want a new mode. Even if that means who won't get those boring and easy solo adventure runs. Something repayable please
---
CrispyCurium#1954
---
Still no 2v2
---
cover up some game-specific features you could say the same thing about league
---
Go to the deck, tap the hero portrait and “copy Deckcode” and paste it here
---
thats the point, we'd like it to be so
---
You’re misunderstanding my phrasing, but sure.
---
No I haven’t actually. But if your having trouble with quest priest as control warrior your doing something verryyy wrong.
---
People aren't even bothering to complain- they're just not playing the game. Myself included.
---
Yeah if we could all get a reasonable amount of content without being whales they might have to actually put effort into cosmetics and other game modes to promote spending.
---
&gt;it's because you're toxic
---
To this day, I still regret building Secret Paladin decks.
---
Unpopular opinion, I don't care for single player content. I'd rather have those multiplayer and QoL updates.
---
Not defending him, just my best guess on it: Maybe he doesn't feel, maybe he doesn't *understand* that what he's talking to is *actually* a real person, that his words could actually hurt someone (although clearly not OP). Well, whether he can "justify" it or not, he's a dick.
---
the older I get the more I will realise that the important thing is what I lived and not what I achieved.
---
For there's no man in town who has more braun
---
Perfect, a pure paragon 
---
You can ask any Jaina or Gul’dan 
---
And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on
---
I love kazakus and Zephyrs, but that's not the kind of card generation I'm talking about. Those are very specific, targeted generations, stuff you can reasonably guess at and play around. I think a certain amount of card generation is healthy.
---
It's when decks like control warrior can generate over 16 random cards a game, and mage and rogue can do the same, that card generation gets out of control.
---
P.S. I think brawl and Ragnaros are some of the best cards this game ever produced. You know what to expect and you can play around them. Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't, that's the nature of a card game.
---
Question was about crafting dust but yeah this is helpful rank 25 is impossible to win in omg I demolished kids before this and now I can’t even win one xD
---
I wasn't aware it was mandatory to enjoy playing as every class to have fun in this game.
---
I'd like a refund on dusting my priest cards now,  please.
---
I like the theme, some mechanics and some cards.
---
However, the game got so expensive i barely can make any cool decks. Just look at highlander mage - you need a minimum of 7 legendaries to make it work and like 8-9 epics - for **one** deck.
---
What exactly is tournament mode supposed to be like in hearthstone in your opinion?
---
Hmm. Ressurect priest uses it quite well, I really can't complain about the winrate. I wouldn't want it breaking the meta anyway + as someone mentioned, it still takes quite a satisfying amount of skill to play it well + Priest was always supposed to be the quirky class. I have 99 problems with the current design of HS, but the Priest quest ain't one.
---
To be fair, you needed to be a deranged piece of shit to be playing Patron Warrior.
---
Isnt print screen faster than picking up your phone and opening camera?
---
Say sike
---
The dust requirements are becoming obscene and this need to be changed ASAP, the game is already dying, Uldum got the lowest viewership on Twitch.
---
Armor is fine if you keep up board control. Its problematic if your opponent gains armor and kills every minion you have on board.
---
Arena rewards gold, cards, packs, and dust. It's the best way to farm a lot of nary used cards to disenchant into dust, as well as dust itself. And of course, if you want plenty of it, you'll have to be a decent player.
---
Exactly, I put some money in at the start and could put more in if I felt like it, but the value you get for the money is so low I dont even bother, as you said you need probably a couple hundred every set to be able to experiment. It's a shame, most of the player base just has no other option FTP or not, after experiencing the punishment I got for brewing I'm never putting money in again.
---
Barnes isn't the (main) problem, it's the crazy res cards. Remove "friendly" from Eternal Servitude and Resurrect and it'll be a fairer deck.
---
Are you perhaps only playing once a week? I'm curious because just by completing the daily quests you can easily open 50 to 60 packs per expansion "for free".
---
Ok 👌 thx I’ve only ever played priest so idk how well I’ll do with other characters to get arena xD
---
Cheat it out your deck meaning you can cast it without having it in hand if you didn’t.
---
This game has always been fulfilled with contradictions
---
Do I need Kangors endless army for that? I have most everything else
---
Seconded. It's a good mechanic, but its supposed to be a survival/comeback mechanic, not a steamroll one. There's should be better ways in interacting with armor, since there is currently nothing except attacking it.
---
I can't see anything objectively rude in op's reply. They are entitled to disageee with you and didn't say anything inflamatory.
---
I would rather trade, cause I don't get how to build a deck that wants to use as aggro tool that isn't very good at making sticky boards.
---
I am coming from league of legend, you know the game with the so called worst and most toxic community ever, and when i started HS back in mean streets i discovered that this is just as or even more toxic of a community.
---
Definitly, even though aggro is pretty strong against the deck its just dumb that a control deck instantly has an almost impossible matchup. And with Catherina and Archmage Vargus from RoS its even worse
---
Sorry to hear that. I'm not even sure why I keep playing. I knowethe meta well enough. I might switch to arena and play it on and off from standard.
---
A classic
---
That's very true. People who don't play too often can also still use the decks they are familiar with.
---
Thats why I think the expensiveness of the new decks is a big Problem too. Its a beaten horse at this point, but a man can hope they change the dust system for the better.
---
It's interesting, I'm in a couple of communities of "priest players" and the numbers dwindled down extremely hard this last expac. but a lot of players came back with this release... the thing is not even a week has gone by and the community is dead again, it turns out that priest players are not into the "our identity is not dealing damage and not having card draw", for me Priest was The Control Masterclass that could get value from the opponent, but since our identity changed and Warrior does everything we could as a control class better it's no longer the case.
---
Congratulations :)
---
No response is also a response the community hates, making the argument a moot point.
---
If they say nothing, they are saying "we don't give a flying fuck about what the community wants, and go fuck yourselves"
---
I'm ashamed I preordered this time.  I like the set well enough, but every expansion I leave sooner and sooner.  And when I'm around, I just stick to wild.  At least there I can find some deck diversity, even if it means facing big priests and odd paladins
---
Like I said I’m f2p.  I end up with all the commons, around 80% of the Rares, and then whatever Legendaries and Epics I need for the decks I play or otherwise opened, and I always have a lot of dust sitting around.
---
If you just don’t repeatedly dust 1600 worth of stuff to make 400 worth of stuff, dust 400 worth of stuff to make 100 worth of stuff, etc. you’ll end up in a very good position.
---
That’s not to say the game is perfect for f2p as I can’t play every deck and I miss out on playing new decks in the early meta while I build up my cards from the newest expansion, but unless your plan is specifically to only play the game for a short period of time and max out those 3-6 months then quit, it does not pay in the long run to be dusting cards to make cards.
---
At 7 it was absolutely terrible.  I tried making it work so many ways and it just could never make the cut.  The buff made it playable but not op.  I happen to think it’s right where it needs to be currently.
---
Hahahahaha......the point is everything is relative. If you can’t afford to play then don’t.  What I said went way above your head much like the decks you wish you had.....out of reach man. Good luck on your life’s journey.
---
I made a token Druid quest where I had low cost minions (like acornbearer, mecharoo etc.) do that in the early turns I can still put out some cards whilst having unspent mana at the end of the turn. I finish the quest around 5-6 mana and then the cancer begins where I put down all the choose one cards. Don’t have Cenarius or Loti (I usually get them from the discover a choose 1 card). Everything is pretty much classic,rare or common (except Druid quest).
---
Me too, these decks just aren’t too exciting; at least the ones that have good winrates.
---
Good luck on your journey.
---
Yep exactly. Everythings too expensive, Meta gets stale, I fear the game is dying even though they do many things right, actually.
---
Yes
---
Because I dont like the decks that beat it and I dont want to have even less fun because of one single card.
---
So I rather stick to my tess rogue with scheme so I can at least win some matches by outvaluing the warrior with luck
---
I regret spending money on this game.
---
Don't worry, everything is on their radar and is coming soon^TM
---
Devs won't answer since their hands are tied and even if blizz employees have great vision for  any of their games they most likely get shut down if those ideas don't mean more money for the company.
---
For example tournament mode is good for players since everyone would have an easier access to enter competitions. This would cost money to implement but they either don't know how to do it or don't want to, I would say it's the latter since it doesn't make them immediate money even though they could charge money or gold as entry fee.
---
You actually forgot graveyard implementation.
---
I wouldn't play hearthstone were it not for card generation and single player. When I want a physical card game I play MTG.  
---
My problem with Hearthstone is the fragility of minions, weak flavour, and the existence of decks that are full of stat sticks. And Dr. Boom because of the REPEATABLE card generation that doesn't cost a card.
---
Yeah why the heck are we limited to so few deck slots??? There’s way more different decks than deck slots??
---
Try Mage and Shaman. They have fairly solid Basic and Classic sets.
---
I hear you. I follow the rule of never crafting unless I need it and let the pack opening push me. This has only kind of worked me. I'll never be able to play a control deck or a combo deck. I want to try maly druid but I can't test drive the deck. So right now I have midrange hunter, mech hunter, nomi priest, and a home made tempo rouge I took to legend last season called gifting rouge. Sometimes you get lucky.  but now I feel like playing arena the first time as expansion comes out. Just to invest.
---
Will do
---
&gt;People defending Acti$$ard to this extend
---
I'm not defending Blizzard or Activision or anyone. As I said to him, I just want people to get their fair dues. Blizzard/Activision deserves shit for making shitty, greedy decisions like $80 pre-orders being the only way to get heroes, still no "no-duplicate Epics" rule, and the entire shitshow that was WoW: Battle for Azeroth's launch which is still shit from what I've seen on occasion when I go back to the subreddit.
---
Look, I've been on the WoW subreddit. The Hearthstone subreddit. The Fallout 76 subreddit (Though that was more for the outrage than because I played it; I've never played the game). The Pokemon subreddit. Something all these places have in common from what I've seen over the past couple years (for the first two) and past year or so (for the latter two), is that they have a subset of defenders who will defend the company no matter what.
---
And a point I've made is that others will just let these defenders exist rather than criticizing them, addressing them directly, or downvoting them. In fact quite often the defenders get positive scores too, in spite of all the people talking shit about the game. And I don't get it.
---
If you want your voice to be heard, and if you genuinely see issues with the game, why would you ever tolerate people who are saying "Yeah don't fix those issues" or "Those issues don't exist"? Or how about those who say the company isn't greedy/lazy, or that in turn that YOU/those who are voicing their displeasure are entitled? 
---
You want better games from Blizzard, other people want mediocrity. But you and so many others are perfectly fine with giving those who want the latter, a voice. And you don't consider the possibility that you, yourself are entitled. So how does that work? If you're "objectively" right and the game should actually have more features then don't let people who are wrong propagate their statements. And if you're subjectively right, then yeah, there is 100% the possibility that maybe overall game standards have just gone downhill and demanding more at this point MAKES you entitled.
---
But that's not the case, right? So how do you reconcile with people who say "Yeah I'm happy paying for a mediocre product because I think it's acceptable :)"?
---
Yeah, definitely report him. Imagine if he said that and the person on the other end was an impressionable kid. Never take that talk lightly.
