please insert bullet into my brain
---
At this point, it's an added feature. It happens so many times!
---
... alright, but how does this let me understand the development process better?
---
I got halazzi, lady in white, and a golden godfrey.
---
This is so embarassing
---
Oh sweet summer child...you should've played years ago when there were still duplicates and all that crap.
---
Spending 50€ to pre order TGT and only getting a single legendary (Icehowl) out of it...that's real pain.
---
Spellstones and shadow vision (and the insane amount of removal they can create) are the problem with most priests archetypes, the high roll potential of Cloning is not even an issue most games. 
---
What can I use to replace Leeroy? Most decks seem to have him. 
---
How are people this dumb? How can dis be?
---
What was really interesting to me was the bit about Chakki and having to finish media training before being able to appear and speak about the game. Makes you wonder what happened to Donais after that last mishap with the media team and whether or not they banned him from speaking or if it was on his own accord. 
---
it has to do with China being petty about censorship and Blizzard not wanting to lose profit from them
---
[[The Skeleton Knight]] even had art variations because of china

6/7/4 | Deathrattle: Reveal a minion in each deck. If yours costs more, return this to your hand.

^(Call/)^[PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=hearthscan-bot) ^( me with up to 7 [[cardname]]. )^[About.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=hearthscan-bot&amp;message=Tell%20me%20more%20[[info]]&amp;subject=hi)
---
1. You're going to have a difficult climb.  There are too many OTK decks against which you basically cannot win.  If you are easily tilted,  these auto-loss matchups will necessitate plenty of breaks.
---
2. To offset these auto-loss matchups,  you need to maximize your good matchups.  This means putting super colliders into your deck.  They are your card advantage engines. 
---
3. Good luck. 
---
Iggy?!
---
He only has 6 reasonable early game minions and 3 3 drops. That's definitely not good in this meta
---
He didn’t...
---
Yeah, I've been away from the game for a while, and last week I decided to take it more seriously. I have seen lots of cards that were completely new to me, even from the wild sets.
---
Can't wait for the next brawl. 
---
I'd wait until we've seen a bunch of the next expansion coming in two or so months before commiting to decks that might not even function properly post-rotation.
---
Like, they lose Defile, Spellstone and their DK - pretty important cards for the deck.
---
But there are 9 sevens...
---
You forgot Deathrattle Rexxar, the most cancerous of them all
---
The consistency is one part of the problem, yes, but consistency is not as problematic if the archetype is not as prominent. Just like how Combo and OTK decks don't feel so bad when they're not so ubiquitous in the meta.
---
Changing it to an End-game card basically kills the card. Oh look, every other turn you're floating Mana until you finally get to reap the benefit of an upgra-- oh wait, you're so far behind you're dead, or are about to be.
---
Even if you changed Baku to be a 9 Mana Justicar Trueheart with similarly no deck building restriction, you're killing every single Odd archetype out there but one. That's *way* too late for Baku to be remotely the same kinda deal as it is now, and being a basically strictly worse Justicar Trueheart is a bad nerf and bad design.
---
I'm also not fond of nerfing Upgraded Hero Powers when Baku's Start of Game effect and its power is more so the problem than the Upgrades themselves. Justicar Trueheart was never problematic, and it would suck for any Hero Power Upgrades in the future to have only these nerfed versions.
---
With that said it is *really* hard to nerf Genn and Baku in a way that feels satisfying. But this isn't one of them.
---
Arcane tracker or any deck tracker overlay 
---
i used to play this card a lot in pre-nerf spiteful druid, fun times
---
Yo what's wrong with reviving Ragnaros? It's not like old Ragnaros where you could just drop it turn 8 and let it run free; you have to actually earn it now (and probably build your deck as Odd such that you can probably play it early enough).
---
thank you very much yeah I just finished the download and just started looking over everything . I'm definitely going to have to do some research if he even want to get as competitive as I was which wasn't very competitive
---
I have the same phone and have almost all of these issues and worse.
---
he simply wasn't as bonkers back in Frozen Throne. What really pushed him to the top was Witchwood and Rush, adding a lot of cheap proactive minions into the pool that could get you easy lifesteal.
---
I only played one game this week. [This is how it went down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1LBQmwSh0k).
---
It is a good deck,  and you can climb with it.  That being said,  there are quite a few matchups that you basically can not win.  This is why I emphasized the importance of adding those colliders. You will need to lock down the good matchups to make progress.  Without them,  you will lose too many games that you should be winning. 
---
&gt; Also let’s point out that maybe we’ll get two new heroes. One from the new standard year and the other from a bundle for the first expansion.
---
Maybe, but it would be a first.
---
Adventures for 3k allow you to catch up and free up a LOT more gold to invest into expansions. Currently you get to spend about 6k quest gold on each expansion. back then you could get the entire adventure for 3k and then get 8k to spend on the expansion.
---
The result is overwhelmingly better, you get the entire set of the adventure, and a much higher % of the expansion. 
---
Things are looking even better if you're a budget player that's willing to drop 20-25$ every second set release. Currently investing that little pretty much gives you nothing.
---
I stole bone spike from him with thoughtsteal and then used divine spirit and inner fire the turn after I played the bone spike to make it a 16/16 for lethal
---
If these Tavern Brawls gave these card backs don't you think the developer would have said something about it in this video?
---
This iteration of Reno Priest is certainly interesting to play because of that. Yesterday I won every game I played in a different way. One time I even Flash Healed my opponent to the face for 20 damage for the win. 
---
What is a utility?
---
[Kripp has a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdUzPfAy6Cw) where his minion casts Myra's on turn two and he still wins.
---
Weren’t the odds in his favor tho
---
She’s an incredible Jade card. Mind you, the deck can work just fine without her. You can still stack jade battlecries for Shudderwock just fine. But it will be much, much better with her. 
---
Since Morgl, the broad idea is to introduce heroes that feel significantly different from the originals. Nemsy, Lunara, Mecha-Jaraxxus, Sir Annoy-O, King Rastakhan all present a pretty different flavour from the existing heroes.
---
I think Faol is a good call, or a different-flavoured Warrior or Hunter (already in WoW or otherwise).
---
Note: Maiev was created together with Liadrin and Tyrande pretty early on (before LOE), so she was technically pre-Morgl.
---
Then why do you play a game where remembering the cards is important? 
---
Like how people thought Cinderstorm wasn't going to be good for Tempo Mage but it was just extra burn so they ran it.
---
Any tips for Odd Mech Deathrattle Pally?
---
Well first of all it’s not as simple as adding or subtracting stats to a card to make it viable. The game tries to stay clear of making a few cards that does the job better among similar cards. They want each card to be played somewhere, even if it is niche. They aren’t going to balance every card to be viable.
---
Second, even a small change could have a huge impact in the game. Hearthstone has thousands of different cards, and even a small change to a card could change up some key interactions and archtypes(potentially although not very likely) and there is no way the dev team can test or predict what kind of impact the change may have on the game. (Note that changes affect the solo adventure modes which could break some of them) The sheer number of cards in the game just makes it impossible for every card to see play and still be balanced. Also, in this current standard game where Baku and Genn exists it’s even harder for the dev team to balance cards they newly add or nerf.
---
Finally , like many others have pointed out, it’s easier and much better for the game and the devs for them to nerf a card to the ground than buffing it, which might cause problems instead.  If blizzard were to buff cards that were not viable at a certain time, it may work out for that period of the year. But when a new expansion is released or there is a rotation of cards, those previously buffed cards may become very problematic. Therefore, blizzard will have to do balance changes to many, many cards on a frequent basis which is impossible for the reasons that there are too many cards, too many interactions, and not enough resources or people that work for hearthstone that can do this right. If they only nerf cards that are problematic, they can just address the offending card and most of the time everything else will be fine.
---
Hope this helps
---
&gt; If all you did was quests each day just to save to the next expansion (i.e. didn't play much more beyond quests) and you rinsed and repeated this between expansions there would be little point to saving as you'd need question why you're bothering playing the game?
---
How do you figure? All you're basically doing is front loading the packs you open. This makes day one of each expansion way more exciting while also potentially saving you dust and gold in a few ways. If you prefer to play it safe while the meta is still being figured out, this gives you a lot of new content to mess around with reducing the urge to make risky crafts.
---
Obviously, if you're into Arena, then you can account for that if you want, but I'm not sure why assume someone going this route wouldn't play much beyond completing quests. If anything, managing your resources this way is all about giving you access to more cards and decks as a F2P player which allows you to enjoy the game more.
---
An Odd Warlock would most likely be a control Warlock (At least it would have before the change to Possessed Lackey), and seeing as the deck would be giving up most of the healing Warlock has access to, the deck would rather draw one card a turn without damage over drawing two cards and dealing four damage to themselves, especially if the format is aggressive.
---
Now, a Odd Zoo Warlock could want to draw two extra cards a turn, but Zoo would much rather play with Prince Keleseth than be able to draw extra cards in the late game.
---
Ah, I see. I was thinking the free agent was already on the board. The warlock is forced to use a Hellfire or Spellstone or a minion to clear the Taskmaster first.
---
Salami for everyone.
---
The technology isn't out yet
---
I'm happy for Poxkajka. Poor dude gets crushed all the time.
---
Each pack in hearthstone is guaranteed at least one rare card. Getting 2 epics and 2 area is not very common though. 
---
Another thing to note is that you are guaranteed to get a legendary in the first 10 packs of each available expansion. After that, if you don’t get any legendaries in the same expansion there is a pity timer of 40 packs. Doesn’t mean you have to buy 40 packs to get another legendaries though, you may be lucky and get legendaries back to back.
---
I did mention that the phrase "designer insight" was an issue though, since it has been used by them to mean something different.
---
And no, Insight is coined out by many teams/companies around the world, like Pornhub's Insight blogs (which is truly about the knowledge aspect of insight), or Riot Games' insight team (similar reasoning).
---
Overall though, neither of those were really my point, my point was simply that given a different context, Insight could've been the right tern, and that berating that guy feels a little off.
---
53.6% on all regions, post-patch data.
---
My first was tempo rogue. Coin scrub forever.  
---
If I had to make a deck purely out of basic cards with which to compete it would look like this:
---
Priest
---
Northshire Cleric (2)  
---
Holy Smite (2)  
---
Power Word: Shield (2)  
---
Shadow Word: Pain (2)  
---
Acidic Swamp Ooze (2)  
---
River Crocolisk (2)  
---
Murloc Tidehunter (2)  
---
Shadow Word: Death (2)  
---
Shattered Sun Cleric (2)  
---
Razorfen Hunter (2)  
---
Chillwind Yeti (2)  
---
Senjin Shieldmasta (2)  
---
Holy Nova (2)  
---
Stormwind Champion (2)  
---
Mind Control (2)  
---
Gave it to my friend when he was just starting and he made R15 with it. Not sure if free decks can go much further.
---
Board control and tech choices. 
---
Kingsbane Rogue isn't doing anything if their minions aren't sticking around. There are obviously high-roll outliers, but that doesn't happen a substantial amount.
---
* Tempo Mage utterly destroys the deck because of Explosive and Counterspell.
---
* Even Shaman's almost all universally run Golakka's for the Rogue snipe. The deck is already a hard matchup for Odd Rogue because of their amount of efficient board clears &amp; massive board swings. It's no different against Kingsbane.
---
* Odd Paladin is self explanatory. It's gets online fast and doesn't lose the board once it does.
---
* Odd Rogue is a closer matchup, but once Kingsbane loses board they're not dealing with Thug's, etc. It might be a little different this month because of CB being removed but I had around a 75% w/l ratio against Kingsbane last month on my legend climb (about 25% of my total matchups were Rogue - most being Kingsbane). Teching 1x Ooze &amp; 1x Zilliax generally tips the favor into Odd Rogue.
---
Yikes. You get something for 500. If you want to play the class more that's up to you. This way its achievable to do it with all the classes. 
---
It's like when I play Multi-Quest Priest. You hope, but damn, sometimes, you don't get quest twice. It just doesn't happen.
---
Oh i love when my mage blocks the nether portal
---
Hey my dude, good work as always. 
---
I've been following your posts weekly, and realised u are probably using a template for the opening post. Thought to let u know do a typo
---
"To see the hole deck..."
---
It should be whole, I suspect. 
---
Appreciate the good work nonetheless!
---
Queen Taelia indeed!  Here's hoping.
---
There is a difference between being a control deck and creating a fucking stealth or charged 8/8 minion every turn.
---
NaTHANOS 😤😤
---
The worst headache I ever got from a game was XCOM 2. The return to mission select screen had a terrible shaking effect.

I for one haven't seen a coins back promotion for HS in the last 2 years or so. They were a lot more common before.
---
Fluff flair
---
Don't you need to spend them first?
---
Preferably with NSFW art. 
---
I wasn't. He ended the match spamming "well played" for as long as his whole turn lasted, then I emoted "Thank you" back as his hero exploded.
---
Right,that was what I thought. 
---
When will the promo expire, do you know?
---
&gt;Shipping Anduin with anyone other than a Draenei 
---
No
---
Good job then :)
---
When is the last day we're getting a gold + dust quest? (I'm in NA.)
---
It already expired. They don't announce these and usually they don't last long.
---
No idea. I don't have Genn :p
---
Deleting this as it expired and it's getting downvoted into oblivion.
---
For future reference: this coins back promition lasted at least one hour.
---
Man i am going to miss charged devilsaur... I feel like the charge mechanic for it has been great and it has never felt OP
---
I've a beast priest deck built around it that will be dead come april :(
---
Played one Ravencaller 2 turns ago and got one Chameleos (proof in the weapon I have equipped that is the one he equipped after I played it) and then this turn I played another Ravencaller and got two Chameleos. Pretty crazy, cbf doing the math but.   
---
P.s. assume before the top.deck.vial.you were heading straight for the necrium blade into hero power?
---
Infinite value
---
You people thought blastwave was op, but check this out.
---
Honestly, just tired of the neutral, non-conditional, card draw guy. 
---
Yea.. I had lethal even without the topdeck, but Vial made it way more satisfying :D
---
On the 13th, ended on the 12 initially, but they extended it because of the patch delay.
---
I won’t know what deck to play after April ;(
---
This deck was pretty fun
---
Good graph OP.
---
Aaaanndddd, TIL: Secret paladin is a proper standard deck.
---
Yeah it got the highest winrate atm. Didn't belive it either at first.
---
I guess it catches a lot of people of guard?
---
And ty :) 
---
Thanks
---
all this is going to do is make it more likely that they never give us dust for quests since we complain everytime it goes away
---
Yeah I'm not a fan of OTK meta either, but I wholeheartedly hated single deck metas. I used to not play ranked at all then.
---
Commonly refered to as sandbox mode.
---
Many magic formats have come out of players experimenting with different rule sets. If Blizzard wants more format variety this would be one way to go.
---
That was super fast,it lasted just a couple of hours. Maybe it was a mistake, idk.
---
If you have 1 Silverhand recruit destroy the enemy hero
---
Haha yeah I understand! I know when I’m frustrated and what not but never really knew it was that crucial on my gameplay. Which makes sense. My win streak is gone and immediately I’m like.... damn. 
---
no i just want a deck list.. 
---
We must be complete opposites. I've been mostly playing arena for a long time now and feel most constructed decks are extremely annoying to play against. Those run-based constructed brawl events fill me with dread, although to people who love it, I'm sure it must be the best thing ever.
---
It helps if your deck is already insane 
---
Dude hunter doesn't matter. I can beat you with hunter with angry chickens in the deck.
---
Im hearing serving in life and in death?
---
Yeah. Cheapest Odd Paladin has only Baku as a legendary and it still has a good performance
---
Yeah and Paladin either makes tons and tons and tons of dudes that you run out of ways to deal with or literally goes immune until they find their win condition. Druid sits there playing solitaire, Warrior doesn't actually have cards, just a hero power, Warlocks are too busy dropping 8/8s on turns 3 and 4. Hunters seem to have more wolves than Paladin's do dudes, what's a Shaman? Everyone does broken shit.
---
i don't found anyone hit high legend with it after the nerfs
---
Copied the deckcode, to terrorize casual when I'm bored.
---
How does it play against the meta decks? 
---
Lack of board clears frighten me.
---
I find all Shudderwock decks fun so I am biased AF. That said, the jade deck is fun once it gets rolling. I think i went 3-3 but i am very bad at this game.
---
I would say Zola makes any shudderwock deck better but she's probably not essential. The banker that tucks a copy into library is probably your closest option. Some extra draw might work too.
---
Quest Priest and Mage who don't get the quest reward cause their hand is too full 
---
They should do higher rewards for the last month or two for every exlansion, anyone who would have bought packs already did and f2ps get a chance to experiment when the meta is already getting stale
---
I am convinced...she's next
---
Oh dang. Okay ill see what i want to do from here. Thanks!
---
Maybe. But never in arena
---
I'd be really happy if they just perma-retire Genn and Baku after rotation. It's going to restrict the game as long as they exists.
---
Damn do I regret disentchanting my wild cards looking at this rng fiesta :(
---
And those are fully optimized versions. Odd Paladin is still really powerful without Liam for example which I assume is the version in this graph.
---
But how about the average winrate on what rank? 
---
Im in the same place.. have only played 4 games on ladder this season.. bored out of it
---
Druid in wild is even worse, your options are jade Druid or no Druid, although jade Druid is a little more forgiving to new players than the standard deck he’s talking about 
---
This guy gets it
---
Thrallmar Farseer? Unironically? Huh.
---
Got a golden Genn. A man can dream!
---
Two words, though.
---
Yoga
---
Pants
---
I think the best thing I ever did was not looking at hearthstone too competitively. Not at all actually. The day I started playing whatever I wanted, mostly meme and gimmick decks, I started to really enjoy the game.
---
You'll make progress just as fast. All that's missing is a high rank number next to your name. 
---
It also doesn't trigger auctioneer, since it is not a spell. That is quite limiting. I agree with you that is really nog that good.
---
It is also worse than posessed villager because if it is killed on your opponent's turn, you can not immediately attack with it on your turn. Which limits it's usefulness in tempo decks.
---
Make it a 2/1 with Rush
---

---
Becuase those are not all the decks that are played . Those are the 15 or so best decks.
---
Also its from all ranks , so at lower ranks a lot of people play homebrewed decks etc., so that max those numbers a bit higher aswell.
---
But this guy Spaghetts it.
---
You didn't really go wrong, the priest had a great draw with double Mass Hysteria. You got shut down by double Dire Frenzy, which doesn't do much here.
---
I'd consider playing Animal Companion on turn 4, not trading against the Gargoyle, not trading against Malygos and perhaps not buffing the Lynx. Other than that, nothing was really glaring.
---
Thank you, looking forward to my 3200 dust
---
Only one person sucks here
---
Well this card art is tiny when playing the game 
---
I actually won
---
RIP shaman 2018-2019
---
He played thief priest
---
Damn that sucks.
---
[removed]
---
They themed it to vanilla WoW pretty well back then. Repair costs for MT required a big wallet - plate isn't cheap to fix.
---
No. They’re seeing pressure all around and noted that Hearthstone, like it’s other titles, was seeing declining users. But the reality is that Hearthstone is one of the most economically efficient games in their stable (if not necessarily the biggest absolute moneymaker), requiring relatively low development and upkeep costs compared to their other titles. If anything, they should look to lean in on Hearthstone in order to boost flagging sales/profits. Offer more hero portraits, deck backs and other reasons for the whales to spend money.
---
Whether they do or not remains to be seen, but the economics of Hearthstone are great for ATVI and you don’t pull the plug on that.
---
I'd just save for the next expansion.
---
It was a joke about doing something amazing but then getting otk by a bs combo 
---
Yeah you don't suck when you claim that deck recipes are good. Sure.
---
Pogo Hoppers, perhaps?
---
For someone slightly out of the loop, i get they covered a certain image. And that is where the memes began. But which one was it? One of Jaina's i think? Anyone got the before and after for me?
---
Yeah, at first I was worried what other colour I use for shaman after mage, but turns out there isnt a single shaman deck. Even is the first in Tier 3.
---
Warrior is Blizzard's token p2w class.
---
The difference is I can go down the street and get my bread for free. If someone is giving away free bread, and you are charging $2 for a loaf, you better hope yours tastes like cocaine
---
Honestly, I would play my budget version that works. I wouldn't craft anything that rotates and I would just save dust/gold until you find something else you want to make. Zoolock is almost always "playable" even if not in a tier one spot; actually was my first deck as well💕. The classic cards are most deff a safe bet. 
---
They are a small indie Dev, so I agree they would absolutely go bankrupt if people averaged 25 packs and 1-2 legendaries per expansion as free to play. 
---
Silver Hand Knight?
---
&gt;The point is, ladies and gentleman, that greed -- for lack of a better word -- is good.
---
&gt;Greed is right.
---
&gt;Greed works.
---
&gt;Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.
---
&gt;Greed, in all of its forms -- greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge -- has marked the upward surge of mankind.
---
Well, it's obviously very hard to change these two cards, as people keep saying over and over. But I think *Battlecry* design is the most ellegant out of all we've seen so far and has the most sense. Who cares if it's just another Justicar! I mean, eventually they'll have to reprint same effects anyway, like Magic does.
---
I like it a lot! I'd personally lower the stats on both, so it has bigger drawback for playing the card and get the effect.
---
Yes
---
I got my ass eaten when playing odd rogue, so I switched to zoolock. Had a 90% win rate from 10 to 5, it took about a little over an hour.
---
I agree with you on the second part, innerfire combo decks are frustrating to play against and just plain BORING.
---
Priest-in-heavy-armor-with-a-glowy-sword starts to be a bit much
---
It can be probably nerfs of ressurections. Something like 2 mana - ressurect a minion that died in a game with cost 7 OR LESS. And up the cost of eternal servitude to 5 or maybe even 6. We should persuade Blizzard to do something. But how?
---
I really don't care.
---
I mean, I'll fake an opinion if it helps?
---
It's fine by me either way.
---
As you pointed out in that same thread, it can also be used to buff non starting hero powers. But he does bring up a valid point, and would perhaps make more sense to make genn have lower stats and be two mana for the nerfs I'm proposing, so he would function in a way similar to keleseth
---
Hi, game developer here and...I agree, and it comes down to game design, which comes down to human psychology.
---
Fundamentally humans are pretty loss-adverse.  Like, there have been psychological tests where if you show them something, and ask how much they'd pay for it, they'll offer you maybe $2, but if you give them that thing, let them hold onto it for a bit, and then ask to buy it off of them, they'll suggest $20.  People don't like giving up stuff they have.  Loss adverse.
---
Which, in terms of hearthstone, means dusting cards is just feels bad.  I don't even like dusting my extra copies of cards "but what if they get nerfed?"
---
Hearthstone would honestly probably be more enjoyable if you could not dust cards, but got dust from daily quests instead.  Like...this doesn't need to be a giveaway, just having access to dust without needing to delete parts of your collection.
---
What makes it bad is that it is a powerful agro midrangy deck that has a strong late game. Yiu really need lots of healing and board control to even have a shot
---
I like how people complain about hunter, Baku/Genn and a priest then this shows up. 
---
That really depends on where you buy.
---
At Walmart, Target, Amazon, etc, rarely if ever on newer products.
---
At dedicated game stores and sellers, that'll be on a case by case basis.
---
Physical card game makes do quite often create products with a lot of value in them on a per card basis (Yugioh's Special edition boxes, MtG Deck Builder's Toolkit, and so on), but some are better than others at doing it.
---
To be perfectly honest I hadn't seen the other post, but I maintain that my idea isn't quite the same.
---
For how much this sub complained about Secret Hunter I was expecting it to be much much higher.
---
High Overlord Saurfang, please.
---
Whizbang has a lot of decks that you most likely lose with anyways. I think it got closer to a 50/50 when it comes to "good"/bad Whizbang decks. 
---
Reasons why Hunter is played is because he's the cheapest class: 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DWaVEbmiw0&amp;t=2s
---
Or nexus champion saraad into flare
---
Lol
---
i dont understand
---
I actually enjoy the meta change, my main decks are Even Warlock and Deathrattle Hunter, each beat Secret Paladin and Zoolock pretty easily. There are few bad matchups but i always lose to goddamn Mosh Ogg Enforcer Priest. Literally 4 cards tp resurrect him, only counterplay is Hex and Poly, i added Mossy to my Hunter again but having more than one makes your deck bad, plus it doesn't kill Grizzly
---
I know, but still now there is bqsicly 1 dead deck
---
The easiest way to design around Odd and Even decks would be to create cards the Odd or Even deck in a particular class wouldn't want to play. That's why Paladin has been receiving more control oriented cards than usual in the last set or two.
---
Only the Odd and Even decks that have been seeing play since the release of Genn and Baku can really be considered boring, but they're no more so than other deck like Zoo Warlock, which have been making the same sort of opening and closing plays since the inception of the game.
---
Cuz this data is T H I C C
---
Ah, alright, thank you.
---
Ready sir!
---
i've been playing secret pally in wild for ages now, i'm surprised that people didn't know it was good
---
r/dataisbeautiful 
---
Baku and genn do not need fixing. Genn isn't even that OP right now. It's baku's hero powers that need reworking. 
---
So you had a good experience followed by a good experience?
---
&gt; You can't even afford 1 mid-range deck per-expansion as a FTP
---
I honestly have no idea how you guys even play this game.
---
Except we've gotten this thread at least once a day
---
Not gonna happen, too confusing for new players.
---
Is that true? He has coin for a free fireball. I’m not saying I disagree, but I think it depends on how slow his deck is
---
&gt; Because if you are building a broad collection and just filling in the gaps by crafting sensibly then you will never be "down 3000+ dust". 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That would be fine if Epics had a generally broad scope instead of the narrow scope actually in practice.
---
Unique card in dungeon run. It's fun. It's free. Go play it a few times!
---
but that only counts in wild, if you're talking about level up
---
odd pally can't have level up in their deck
---
am I getting wooshed
---
I read "bfa" but my brain said "K/DA"
---
The rule of thumb is that anyone can get to 5 with enough effort.
---
Summon two Horsemen hell yeah balanced
---
Maybe it’s malygos
---
Doesn’t really allow a nice curve. The best curve is:
---
turn 2 Cavern Shinyfinder
---
Turn 3 Equip and hit with Necrium Blade
---
Turn 4 Play Illusionist or Blightnozzle Crawler and trigger their deathrattle
---
Mega-poisonous. It’s a minion created by a boss near the end and if it damages anything the target dies. Hilarious watching warrior players hit it with a weapon and instantly die.
---
OP managed to add a copy of said minion to their deck against the final boss.
---
Rn i would avoid any decks that heavily rely on cards that are about to rotate out, like any ungoro or koft cards
---
Evenlock is one of my favorite decks of all time, up there with Renolock, Control Warrior, and Mech Shaman
---
Turn one lost in the jungle turn two heropower would be pretty busted
---
That's too powerful. A guaranteed 2/2 on every hero power turn is not trivial.
---
Correct. But it would still be faster than trying to get there from rank four. A new account gets me there in a week. My existing account takes four months. 
---
I dont think they are that concerned about giving dust. I think they care more about the State of the game as a whole.
---
Only possible dilemma I see is one of identity, since that matters for Silver Hand Recruits. Is it just a 2/2 with the same name as the 1/1 variant? A normal 1/1 recruit with a +1/+1 buff? Or does it get a new name to match the upgrade? Each is awkward to some extent. Either you have a name overlap on one of the most common minions in the game, or you run into trouble when 2/2s are recognized as 1/1s when they are being summoned, or you lose all the recruit synergy.

It's not a Blizzard thing
---
There is some data blizz published a while ago saying that r10 was about the top 10% of players. Its more than a bit dated (they've reworked the ladder system three times since it was published, all likely moving the average rank to better ranks), but if you want an idea, its somewhere around that. 
---
Honestly, a respectable "rank" is whatever you feel proud of. Making it to 10 is a big deal. I spent a lot of time (like a year) at 15 before I decided it was time to play good decks and actually learn the game. If you really want a benchmark to set yourself against, the community calls r5 "Dad legend" because the climb to 5 is fairly difficult and the climb to legend from that is generally considered more tedious than it is difficult (no more win streaks, everyone playing highly optimized decks). The general sentiment is anyone who can make 5 is good enough to make legend, but doesn't play enough hours. I personally would say that its more like r3 is the "good enough for legend not enough hours" cutoff, but its obviously pretty variable. 
---
Either way, grats
---
Im espionage rogue :3 rolled a toki, got bolvar lmao
---
Thats an interesting one! Im missing the two primordial drakes and the two T.Acolytes. exactly the "soon-rotaters" lol. But theyre strong ones I guess they are worth it though
---
You might be right, and I would definitely suggest keeping him at least until next December's meta settles
---
I ve just hit rank 5 with mechathun druid with over 70% winrate, and i face a few warriors only! Its holding really good againts hunter and i beated half of the priests as well. For umder 5 I defenitely recommend it, its also pretty cheap and suprisingly fun! I needed to make decisions, not like in odd paladin!
---
In the left image you can see the robes hugging around her bottom in a way that forms a crease. It's smoothed out in the right image.
---
I see Val’anyr from time to time. Silence is better in the value game. Seriously though it’s just an idea for something new, it’s not like I’m suggesting some OP tech card. People taking this too seriously lol
---
Blizzard made it your auto favorite during this event.
---
All of those offer more consistency and less risk than Gral, but you may be correct
---
When you get it it is automatically equipped, probably most of the people didn't bother to change it to something else. In my case, I still have it equipped just in case I come across someone who didn't get it yet and I'm lazy. I'll probably change it back to warcraft reforged soon...
---
It's just not how you make a graph sorry...
---
Why not play the quest and then succubus?
---
Clickbait-tier Kotaku Tweet. No thank you.
---
Funnily enough, your deck is one of the only decks that doesn't insta die. Just in your hand you have frost nova (+glyph to maybe get another freeze spell) into blizzard into ice block to survive for at least 3 more turns. I don't see how you win, but you definitely survive longer than many other decks
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3nm3db/charge_minion_bug_and_workaround_psa_tldr_included/)'s a three year old post complaining about it, I'm pretty sure it was in beta
---
I wanted to play Highlander Priest so badly but I couldn’t afford like 50% of the cards in it. 
---
I have most of the cards, worth it to craft Kragwa and some of the Ungoro cards I'm missing? (mostly commons, but still they're rotating).
---
For real though Defile is laughably overpowered.
---
I wish the creator of wall priest would come forward! I loved it the second I saw it weeks ago being played against Dog.
---
Now now, we can't be showing those thighs and shoulders either, gotta cover it all up
---
"These synergies are why these cards are good."
---
"These cards are so good, they'd still see play if we killed their synergies."
---
:|
---
I never recalled rush warrior or big spell mage being anything above tier 3 at any point of hearthstone meta...
---
Got the golden version a few days before the change... That must be worth some dust
---
Thinking same thing. Priest, Warrior, or Hunter as they don’t have more than two options and havent has a new skin in a while. 
---
&gt; Do people have such a glorious existence that they must find such things offensive...
---
Nah, it's just that North America is fucking weird in that violence is completely okay but somehow showing skin is a sin
---
I'm a simple man. I see Azumanga Daioh referenced, I click the like button.
---
"best" is super relative... maybe the best to climb, because they're fast, but definitely not most powerful.
---
Have you even looked at this subreddit after the nerfs?
---
I paid around $200 the first year. Haven’t bought any packs for almost 3 years except to get mechajaraxxus.
---
I have all meta decks except hunter, shirvallah, hakkar and togwaggle, but that’s by choice. This expansion I also crafted meme stuff like Akali, Hooktusk, Mechathun, and Janalai. I have 6k dust and 6.5k gold, I begin saving up for the next expansion pretty much from day 1 of release. That’s the trick.
---
?
---
especially if those players don't have enough dust for a cheap deck lol!
---
I've seen so many Odd Quest Warriors who greedily hold onto the completed quest weapon for several turns just to armor up more and more.
---
It happens most often when playing my Quest Warrior deck, when I've already completed my quest and I'm flinging 8 damage fireballs at their face, slowly widdling them down to nothing.
---
You need to draw both copies.
---
This is just stupid haha
---
All of your minions can attack, including your one taunt, and are undamaged by enemy aoe battle cries, so the board has been full without anyone attacking for a while. Freind game I'm guessing? 
---
Many people climbed to Legend with Rush Warrior fast, it kinda is now a high Tier 2. Very expensive because you need very specific Warrior Legendaries and epics.
---
That’s actually around 40 or so percent. Hearthstone Mobile’s battery notifier is pretty bad.
---
You can take Rexxar out of MR hunter and save half the cost of the entire deck. I guarantee you can hit at least R5 with that version and probably legend. Plenty of other decks have unnecessary epics or even legendaries if you want to save dust. Easy examples are Glass Knight in Even Paladin and Glutronous Ooze in anything that runs it. The best versions of the best decks are expensive but if you dont mind losing .5% on your winrate then they become a lot more accessible.

Everytime nerfs hit the game isnt getting more fun regrettably.

It's just more of the same.
---
I'm taking a break too
---
If someone makes a claim to be true, the burden of truth is on them.
---
I never said anything about Zihi or w/e. I just am challenging the statement that this is the way the meta is suppose to be.
---
You planning to spend all your gold on the new expansion?
---
I wouldnt craft anything until the next exp, but I might be wrong and they go into the hall of fame. But in an interview one of them said they think about changing the upgraded heropowers so its up to you what u want to do
---
Divine favor
---
How often do you play? To clear quests and max gold each day?
---
Thats one example of a meta, it doesn't have to be that way.
---
It was a whiz bang deck, and we both pushed it to see how buffed we could get our minions
---
I've been out of the loop, what happened with Mike Donais?
---
Fungalmancer, Rexxar and Hyena
---
But we were still both attacking each other, we weren’t setting it up
---
“Most teamfights come down to whoever has more ults build up” 
---
Looks like you’ve been stuck in bronze your entire life
---
So you just came back, and already got a good deck and climbing to leyend? sure buddy.
---
And i appreciate your insult, it already shows your real intent with this post. Nobody is defending blizz here, nobody is being a fanboy just for saying that hearthstone is not what you are saying it is. It does have its problems, but none of those are any of the ones you are mentioning.
---
Dont forget to post your screenshots here when you reach legend, oh wait, you wont ;)
---
Yeah I think that would make some sense. Like a way to gain dust besides disenchanting, but to keep their profit it would obviously have to be very very slow.
---
hakkar druid is fun
---
Good place to hide my stash :3
---
Yes bullshit always existed but the game wasn’t built around that kind of shit. I mean decks were built around that but the actual game wasn’t designed around those decks, and blizz used to try to control that sort of thing by merging bad cards. Now it seems like they creating cards based around bullshit. 
---
It's the very state of this reddit when a good post like yours just gets downvoted not because it's telling the truth, but it's because people *just don't wanna hear it*.
---
They are the same people who don't keep on top of their dailies, branding a "chore" and "not even fun to do".
---
People don't want to hear "you don't need all the cards". No, they're happier with the narrative of, "you have to spend your life savings **just to play a single card**".
---
Fact is, it's these very same people who go "I spend more money on this game than any other" who for some reason don't even dare fathom the idea of trying other card games. Broaden your horizons. Get out of your shell. Try the competition. See what else is out there.
---
Why shackle and imprison yourself to HS like that? Sheesh.
---
I doubt salty diablo fans do work
---
Odd rogue was kinda important to keep this OTK nonsense in check but cold blood got gutted :/
---
So the last list as last time, except with Wall Priest added.
---
Yeah I agree that Cube is a strong card, but is kind of the ideal card that you want to be strong.  It creates a bunch of different archetypes in different classes, is an interesting effect, and is strong without being super duper oppressive or feeling like you're forced to play it (Cubelock did get nerfed, but that was more about turn 6 Voidlords imo). 
---
Care to explain why
---
Yeah almost all of these layoffs will likely be in non-development roles. Those are the hardest positions to fill and require the highest level of technical skill relative to marketing or PR positions.
---
Yeah thank God this sub wasn't in charge of balance or they would nerf everything that's even remotely powerful and strong.
---
I recall a few druid decks not even running UI, branching paths and UI did the trick. 
---
Yeah because it’s really hard to go pull a good climbing deck off hearthpwn lol. You’re such a salty little bitch. 
---
So cute! Do you have a pattern? I may need to make some. 
---
I obviously wasn't trying to be funny.  Why would you assume that I'm trying to be?
---
10/10 would definitely murloc again
---
yeah, cubelock got nerfed in the other recruit aspect like the lackey, and in the healing from void pact. Cube is a strong card, and its thanks to it that we have more archetypes in the meta, and none of them oppresive (we had stuff like devilsaur druid, deathrattle hunter, cubelock, deathrattle mech paladin, deathrattle rogue, taunt druid...)
---
Not really, best case scenario is lots of money and less players so the servers will have less of a load, and therefore they will never have to spend a fortune to expand it.
---
Platinum. And Seagull is the one who pointed out the ult fight thing in a video addressing the problem with current Overwatch not long ago
---
Egg Paladin is one of my favorite decks of all time.  It's such a shame it got hit so hard by the Equality nerf.
---
Yeah nerfs fuck me off like that (even though it didnt effect me).  
---
It's like if you're going to nerf do a full routine of nerfs because only nerfing a few cards massively empowers other classes the nerfed class was keeping in check.  
---
More thought into "ok if we nerf this what could the meta look like? Hmm ok far too otk/combo heavy so we also then need to nerf this" so on and so forth.  
---
Instead they treat their live system as a test base to see how the nerfs pan out.  
---
Am I supposed to feel bad for them? They have failed on every front across every IP. If you're bad at your job, you shouldn't have a job.
---
Because the art is off-putting to many people.
---
Real talk though, this card art is ridiculous
---
salty little bitch?
---
For what?
---
I'd say worth it. The core of the deck revolves around cards from this year so it's going to have longevity.
---
Murloc shaman will have it's day eventually
---
Most hero powers are crap for 2 mana, this idea is terrible.

Lol you right. What was I thinking?
---
* Activision transferred publishing rights for Destiny back to Bungie earlier this year.
---
* Blizzard had 35M MAUs in the quarter, as Overwatch and Hearthstone saw stability and World of Warcraft saw expected declines post the expansion release this summer.
---
* Activision Blizzard wants to de-prioritize games and initiatives that aren't meeting expectations
---
* Activision Blizzard will be reducing certain non-development and administrative-related costs.
---
* Investing more for biggest, internally-owned franchises.
---
* More upfront releases, in-game content, mobile, and geographic expansion.
---
* Investments in esports leagues and advertising
---
* 20% increase in development resources in aggregate for Call of Duty, Candy Crush, Overwatch, Warcraft, Hearthstone and Diablo.
---
* World of Warcraft already has a regular cadence of releases and content.
---
* Diablo's headcount will grow substantially, as the teams work on multiple projects.
---
* Roughly 8% of staff were laid off.
---
Bobby Kotick, Chief Executive Officer of Activision Blizzard said “While our financial results for 2018 were the best in our history, we didn’t realize our full potential. To help us reach our full potential, we have made a number of important leadership changes. These changes should enable us to achieve the many opportunities our industry affords us, especially with our powerful owned franchises, our strong commercial capabilities, our direct digital connections to hundreds of millions of players, and our extraordinarily talented employees.”
---
Shadowstep, Malygos, Velen
---
Also, Hearthstone is probably Blizzards biggest ticket right now, with the new wow expansion tanking, hots gutted, and Diablo being in the state that it's in.  Hearthstone expansions are probably gonna be the only big Blizzard releases in 2019.
---
Why is there no mention of mid range? What about fatigue? What about Mill? What about some type of deck we haven't thought of yet?
---
Why is the rock paper scissors approach the way the meta needs to be?
---
yeah there is. you could use it as an excuse to not even look at the search bar before you post a question that has been answered.
---
That warlock deck you talk abou doesnt exist.
---
And you only mention 3 decks, one of them the one you play. There are other board centric decks, lots of them. You seem to just have jumped to conclusions before seeing the rest of the 15+ different decks in the tier 1-3 metagame right now...
---
I mean, I understand why it’s in there. It’s just that you’d have a hard time convincing me it’d see play four years ago. 
---
&gt; das haa
---
This is incredibly untrue when it comes to working in the games industry.  Often the "peoples champ" studios like CDPR are the worst studios to work for.  EA, Activision, and the other malligned companies are generally much better.

How is every deck over 50%? I understand that this doesn't include all the troll decks but I'm really surprised by some of these being over 50%
---
I dont think it matters bc names arent unique in this game 
---
This is just further proof that there needs to be a game developers union.  When you actually read what programmers and devs go through on a regular basis, it's almost cruel.  No job security, shitty conditions, awful crunch, etc.  It's kind of suprising that there isn't one tbh.
---
I'm going by statistics. According to hsreplay, Your winrate goes down when you keep chameleos in your opening hand.
---
I think I heard that Boomsday was a very profitable expansion. HS in general seems totally ok in terms of finance.
---
Money is everything to them. Sad!
---
Since odd paly isnt that much of a problem anymore there is no need for cubelocks
---
well u have my opinion, better save than sorry, and if they cant grind for 2 months as f2p, then hearthstone probably isnt for them :p
---
Lets analyze my statement. 1. I feel extremely bad for the employees- is this incredibly untrue? 2. This is about Activision seeking profits over game design- is this incredibly untrue? Because there are developers in the media saying this. 3. The subs have reflected people being upset with bad game design in a multitude of games- is this incredibly untrue? Shit how can something be incredibly untrue? Does that mean everyone would expect it to be true but by some miracle it is not true? My post was about management putting dollars before game content which ultimately lead to these layoffs. I never once addressed the working conditions within the organizations. 
---
no idea, but saving your gold for a maybe might be worth it then regretting it.
---
White Eyes and The Storm Guardian. I love Pandarian flavor, and this card (and the token) are top-notch. All of the Jade Lotus related legendaries are great, especially Aya and Kun, but White Eyes is definitely my favorite.
---
Really? He left to work on capeshit mobile games? ugh
---
How's Overwatch doing?
---
Twisting Nether is worse by a landslide. It doesn’t play around Deathrattles and doesn’t put a bunch of nonsense back into your opponent’s deck, making topdecks worse. 
---
Fair enough. I was just wondering if the play style would become different as players would need to either chose to hero power or to play a card from their deck. Thus making the deck a bit more diverse in it's play. As opposed to "oh an odd deck, turn two hero power", etc.
---
Regardless of how you feel about Brode (and I have my qualms), his message seemed like the best touch point to add a human dimension to the recent layoffs on the Hearthstone team. I feel terrible for everyone affected, but I didn’t want to focus unwanted attention on any of them while they’re in a rough spot.
---
Definitely and probably always will be Nefarian! 
---
Tried the Corpsetaker secret paladin and, while I'm no where remotely close to as good as I'm sure the creator is with it, I'm having a real hard time seeing how it operates unless you get some really good Favors. Bellringer Sentry in particular: I assumed it buffed Secretkeeper but it doesn't. It's one thing when Challenger thinned your deck by 5 and gave you a colossal follow up turn with multiple forms of protection from minion attacks into Competitive Spirit but most of the secrets seem not worth ever casting from hand costing a card, even buffing the Secretkeeper and Sentry only (immediately) thins the deck by 1.
---
Maybe I should try the non-Corpsetaker version as I was drawing my Thrallmar far too often and a 3/3 DS taunt for 4 isn't too hard to deal with on their turn unless I'm way ahead anyway.
---
Anyone who played it have any insight as to how the secret package fairs better than just a standard aggro/tempo/odd deck?
---
Gorgeous art and amazing sound. The best part is that those all see play.
---
I wouldn't say Anduin or Uther are really problematic because of infinite value, and certainly not Thrall and Garrosh. Anduin's strong, sure, but it's his *burst damage potential* that makes him strong. .
---
Best case scenario is everyone happy. None of these things are that. 
---
Who doesnt love a powerful dragon? I love how his voice line changes based on the class your opponent is.
---
Apex Legends?
---
Or in miracle if you run out of auctioneers
---
This is a subreddit about a mobile game
---
I'm personally more fond of post about defeating The Whisper with a rock.
---
Yeah technical buffed when players complained and got the beast pool to include new beasts
---
I really like the one Darius Crowley has... Idk it just feels epic
---
Hearthstone was originally desktop only, or were you unaware of that?
---
And fun is the only thing worth having.
---
It's matchup dependent. At 7 mana, Twisting Nether would be almost as played as Scream if it were a Priest card. 
---
Priest ruining an aggro deck's draws and avoiding Deathrattles are a bonus. The real power of the card is that it's an unconditional boardwipe. 
---
I wonder how Rexxar got through an entire rotation without any nerf... It is ridiculous. 
---
At least it isn't capeshit
---
Jesse J. Hill was one I saw on MMO-Champion. Who else is he known by?
---
Not great. Stagnant I believe was the word they used 
---
Maybe he wanted more board presence, maybe he's just dumb, who knows. Why are people down voting the OP for explaining his opponent's misplay?
---
&gt;Why is there no mention of mid range?
---
Because Midrange changes between Aggro and "control" depending on what deck its facing
---
&gt; What about fatigue? 
---
What about it? So far, Fatigue has either been a Togwaggle+Naturalize/Coldlight+Shadowstep COMBO deck or a shitty no winconditiopn CONTROL deck
---
&gt; What about Mill? 
---
See above
---
&gt; What about some type of deck we haven't thought of yet?
---
Well, the deck doesnt exist yet so why give a shit? I dont think your entire argument rests on some concept you havent even figured out yourself, does it?
---
&gt; Why is the rock paper scissors approach the way the meta needs to be?
---
Its not an approach, its a theoretical way the meta always turns out based on the available deck types so far (which, by the way, holds true for pretty much every card game to date). 
---
Right now, you can go pretty far with any number versions of Hunter or Odd Paladin. If you need card suggestions, I'd check out HSReplay.
---
...but as far as crafting goes, just keep in mind that Journey, Knights, and Kobolds are all going to rotate out of standard by mid-April.
