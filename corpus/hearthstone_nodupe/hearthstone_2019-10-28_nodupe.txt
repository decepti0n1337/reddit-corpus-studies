---
&gt;I feel as if no one talks about this really oppressive spell, which completly stops the entire enemy board in its tracks for an entire turn.
---

---
That's hardly bad. All the card's able to do is delay the inevitable, not actually put a stop to it.
---
&gt;A big aspect of why I find this OP is that there's very little counter play to it, other than hope you have a spell counter. 
---
# Sometimes counter play isn't reactive.
---
You would counter Frost Nova by only pressuring your opponent just enough that playing the card isn't worth it. Just because you can dump your hand doesn't mean you should. 
---
&gt;If you don't, ggwp ez win 
---
Hardly. Unless the Mage is dropping it the turn before they pull off some combo.
---
&gt;There's a high likelyhood they'll play it late game and proceed to mash your face in. 
---
Only if you weren't able to pressure them enough early on to force their hand. That's another way to counter it.
---
&gt;Its extremely unfun as you just sit there twiddling your thumbs. 
---
I can agree with that, but Control in *any* and *every* card game is all about saying "no" to your opponent.
---
[This shirt](https://mtgproshop.com/product/nope-t-shirt-mens/) exists for a reason.
---
What's worse?
---
Your opponent stopping you from attacking for a turn at the cost of three mana or clearing your board for five?
---
&gt;It feels like a big f you for playing well and having the upper hand. 
---
# What it means is you didn't actually have the upper hand in the first place and were efficiently outplayed.
---
&gt;And for 3 cost per turn. What other 3 card turn has this much effectiveness? 
---
Time Out, Ice Block, Elemental Destruction, Healing Rain, Lightning Storm, Savage Roar (Frost Nova's dark reflection), Reckless Flurry, Treachery targeting Doomsayer, and Witching Hour summoning Hadronox.
---
They should do a daily quest that's tied in to this where you have to summon 50 treants. 
---
But I like this. Generally I've been a believer that human reforestation efforts are pretty sustainable, but thanks to Bolsanaro, I think Brazil is trying to suffocate the rest of the world and yeah... probably can't hurt to plant as many trees as possible.
---
But for the record, I never play Druid because my main decks are both hunter and token druid is a pretty nasty hard counter to my builds.

JavaScript. For example, == treats 3 and '3' the same, as well as all falsy values ('', 0, null, undefined, false, maybe i forgot something). === on the other hand also compares types, so 0 == null, but 0 !== null.

He actually says [mercy killing](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Lord_Godfrey).

It's not easy to discern, due to his accent, (or maybe his mouth scarf?) but it's definitely mercy.

Don't all spells say "spell" on the bottom the way minions do?

I think it‚Äôs on the same spectrum as getting the Darkness as a random legendary is always possible, and is an equivalent feels bad card.
---
Cast a random spell THAT COSTS FIVE OR LESS.... It isn't cast a random spell.
---
Tangentially related, but as anyone busted out Naxxramas in the current meta? 
---
It's like cutting through butter with a red hot poker. That meta was not prepared for the game as it is now. Pretty easy dust if you think 700 gold: ~450 dust is a good conversion rate.

I know for a fact Dragon's Fury counts things like this and Scroll of Wonders as 0 cost spells. This is definitely an interaction they need to fix.
---
It just needs to function to target. The same thing happens if you try to Shadow word: pain a 3/3 trogg and it gets the buff from casting a spell
---
They can, but that doesn't mean they should under most circumstances. The only reason why Tempo Mage, which right now is about as passive as the deck has ever been, is using it at all as usually a one of is because of Evolve Shaman's massive swing turns.
---
Plus, one game is not a good enough sample size to determine anything.
---
I said that the enemy doesnt have to trade with you, he can just play frost nova and go face. Pretty self explanatory.

Seconding this. The Neutral Highlander legendary that is in about 40 percent of decks and pairs with Brann, and the best Hunter legendary and a major win condition. The only other card that competes is Zilliax, since it's good in just about any other deck OP makes, but I would call that a third craft.

I'm not doing this for HK-sympathetic Chinese players.  I'm doing this because I find Blizzard's actions intolerable, and if the choice is between supporting a company supporting a tyrannical regime (or even simply condoning their actions), or potentially depriving some people of one very specific company's worth of entertainment (as if my actions alone would do that...), I'll take the latter any day.
---
I'd also like to point out that unless you actually have any evidence to back your assumption that HK-sympathetic Chinese gamers (though I'm unsure how many of those exist.  The Chinese propaganda and indoctrination are quite strong) do not want Blizzard to suffer for their actions, then said assumption is pure supposition and has no weight in this discussion.  I need not demonstrate that said gamers support such an initiative in order for it to have validity anyway.

What else is it going to give you? Zephyrs doesn‚Äôt work well against full reborn boards, partially because all it does offers is Classic cards. This is a large aspect of why bringing N‚ÄôZoth back has been so problematic. It has just ruined the standard meta, for no reason other than what at first seemed like a ‚Äúfun‚Äù novelty.
---
It's not just long, it's damn disrespectful.
---
Do you feel like a two week turnaround on a fucking dumpsterfire of an update that happened 3? weeks ago is them "doing the best they can to fix it"?
---
I think it is safe to say that they make the most money in the small windows around expansion releases and cba to do anything outside that window.
---
Yeah they slapped it with a 2 mana nerf, crazy

The worst part about this is that it is in casual.

How the fuck are priest and hunter not on here

---
This is Golden Experience Requiem Hearthstone. You will never draw your cards.
---
Except its not a complaint, its a fact that the game is 100% cancer right now.  Those are the facts.  I realize that the defenders of these broken decks will swoop in and claim otherwise but no one is buying it.  Evolve shaman and res priest are so out of control right now that the game is unplayable.  Period.
---
The best part about the mirror is that for some reason ppl decide to jam their second sceme when they still have some n'zoths left and then start to emote spam once your down to your last few. And then you hit them with the 30 nzoth shuffle you've been keeping.

---
You cant "easily" reach 30/30 jades except in heavy fatige matchups. 
---
It almost never happened even in KTF jade druid vs jade druid mirror matchups.
---
r/usernamechecksout 
---
(But I agree with you)
---
dragon priest was very tempo/value based  enjoyed that deck too but when you compare it to current versions of vale/control priest the deck essentially just exists to foil shaman to let them do as little as possible
---
A utopic format is one we're not in.
---
I reckon you're one of them filthy aggro players
---
Duskbreaker was going to single-handedly destroy the game.
---
I guess the ideal meta is that whatever 30 cards you put in your deck you have an equal chance of winning against any other player. 
---
This is balance.
---
Deck list? I‚Äôd like to play around with it :)
---
DiVeRsItY
---
(Old) Quest rogue  now changes the base stats (like the buffs from bob‚Äôs tavern in the solo adventure) of your cards to 4/4 instead of an aura that change the stats to 4/4.
---
So cards like Sonya or Barnes that applies debuff on minions they summon to become 1/1 will become 1/1 (but if silenced they return to 4/4).
---
Another consequence of the change is that minion that get stolen or will remain 4/4 (same if they get a copy of your cards in their hands)
---
I think the quest still buff tokens and polymorphed/hexed minions.
---
Matchmaking exclusively matching you to somebody playing the same deck as you. Perfect balance.
---
Ehhhhh.....
---
heroes of the storm is balanced
---
Quests are programmed to never show up on random spell generation
---
Remove Evolve. Problem solved
---
Right now it's a really good deck imo, it took me from rank 15 to 7 with about a 70% winrate. It does fairly well vs shamans because they usually don't have enough burst to kill you once your khartud's come down and you can manage the early board well vs them if you use sap and walk the plank to deal with their big evolved minions. Also crushes every controll deck by default since they can't deal with 20+ full boards of khartuds. Aggro mage is an issue but they become less prevelant by the day.
---
What's the cost of entry if I want 5 meta viable decks and enough cards to experiment?
---
As someone who stopped playing a few months ago, why is shaman so dominant? It wasnt when I stopped. What decks are dominant?
---
Desert hare(and mogu flesh-eater) + evolve. Shaman isn't as dominant as the graph would have you believe, OP just ran into a streak of them.
---
easiest to hardest, res nzoth priest, control shaman, nzoth warrior, control taunt warrior. anyone of those decks will get you to rank 5 easily
---
When was the last time we received compensation packs? It has been a few years hasn't it?
---
You're being purposely obtuse. People don't want a meta with completely equal representation. They just want one that isn't 50%+ one single deck type. There have been several metas throughout hearthstones history that have been generally well regarded. Stop being stupid.
---
It's just that both of you are talking about a small sample size, shaman is popular but nowhere near 70%
---
Have we ever received those? Does blizzard know about the word "compensation"? Damn i didn't know that
---
Quest shaman and aggro shaman also run Mogu Fleshshaper
---
Honestly, I think right now would be a pretty decent meta if we had a viable pure face deck.  Shaman feels broken because there aren't any decks in the meta that are capable of killing it before their high-roll turns take over the game.  That lets Shaman go more greedy in its deck construction, which then also lets it beat control through near-infinite value.  If Face Hunter was around and threatening lethal by turn 5 consistently that wouldn't be an issue.
---
That's the problem with the Hearthstone community when it comes to meta evaluations.  Everyone has this massive rage boner against true aggro strategies, when they're extremely necessary for a healthy meta.  Every real aggro deck we've had since TGT/LoE era Face Hunter has been either nerfed into the ground (Raiding Party Rogue, Pirate Warrior) or is actually a tempo deck that people call aggro (Aggro Shaman of Kara, Aggro Warrior of last meta).
---
At the same time they've printed progressively stronger control tools for a couple classes each expansion, further forcing that archetype out.  The result is a march to greed, and there's always one deck that can just out-greed everyone else.  Right now it's Quest Shaman and Druid, last expansion it was Control Warrior, before that it was Odd Warrior, on and on.
---
Until the community perception that aggro is horrible for the game shifts, we'll never have a utopic meta.  And that's probably never going to happen, because greed is inherently attractive to most players, and it "feels bad" to die on turn 5 after passing a bunch of turns because your hand is all 6 drops or higher.
---
I'll send one at 5ish est
---
Honestly haven't played hearthstone again since the Hong Kong debacle broke out
---
I haven‚Äôt played hearthstone in a loooong while but off the top of my head, it would be a meta with options. Not necessarily where every class has a deck from every archetype all with +50% win rate, but one where if you really like one class, or really like one archetype, then you can play it with an underdog deck semi-successfully, even if the meta doesn‚Äôt favor it. It should still be fun to play an underdog deck, and that‚Äôs probably hard if you get smashed by the same deck 10 times in a row. So more variety is probably the name of the game.
---
Since you like balance so much, I propose the new hearthstone format is just neutral cards with hero powers disabled
---
If he used shadowflame on the buffed 9-attack sylvanas everything dies except the two reborn khartut defenders and he steals one of them with her deathrattle.
---
I think what he's saying here is that just because a deck ends up being too powerful doesn't mean it was necessarily bad design. There are plenty of cards that have interesting and thoughtful design but just turn out to be too powerful. 
---
People really need to cut Iksar some slack. He is actually responding to community like we asked and all we are doing is discouraging him. He was extremely mindful on the Genn and Baku problem and admitted to not liking the environment that the design created. I think it's super unfair to put a target on his back all of a sudden just because he doesn't explicitly say "evolve bad kill shaman" like you all want him to.
---
You're taking the post too literally. Of course theres been ups and downs, just a lot more memorable downs than ups so I want to gauge what the general idea of an up is
---
Ah yes, so it's better to play cancerous and WRONG/bugged decks just for the sake of victory while everyone else in the game is just struggling against the best performing deck out here that should be fucking nerfed? cool, not my type of game.
---
really glad devolve help in these situation, pretty bad that anyway mechathun does the job if you don't close fast after SnipSnap disruption.
---
what a deck.
---
Witchwood after the first nerf was almost that, if I remember correctly all 9 classes had at least a tier 2 deck.(maybe priest was the only that had a tier 3, I don't remember that well)
---
Acolyte of Pain will continue to draw cards even if it's dead. Happens with Starfall, too. It's really weird to me that you can't heal a dead minion, but you can continue to damage it.
---
I know it doesn't matter for the vast majority of them, but, for the few where it can (Wrath, Starfall, Crystal Power, Oasis Surger), it almost always follows the order of the card. Another exception besides Keeper of the Grove that I just thought of would be Cenarius.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
EDIT: I cannot think of another scenario where the order of Wrath matters off the top of my head. That means that in 100% of scenarios that I can come up with, doing 1 first is better.
---
Not directly related, but I think the game will be more fun if there‚Äôs no HSreplay. With the data mining that it does, it‚Äôs so easy to find best decks and the game become optimized(full of a handful of best decks). The first time I quitted HS was because every opponent I faced were virtually the same‚Äî it felt like I played against only 4 opponents all games(the four being meta decks)
---
&gt;Maybe the game needs a big change.
---
There really isn't any way a ccg can stop a full archetype like aggro from existing in a meta, even with a heavy control meta, there will still be at least  1 or 2 tier 2-4 aggro decks
---
Edh seems so much fun! I'm working on getting a deck irl so I can play with people
---
It used to work that way, but they changed it when they changed sea witch to break giants so that these effects applied in a different order.
---
You get the prizes for an active run just like as you finish it and receive another ticket.
---
Big Priest had brief moments in Tier 1 but was never as dominant at Tier 1. Furthermore, aggro decks in Wild are both prevalent and powerful, directly countering Big Priest which is mostly why it before the Barnes nerf the deck dropped from Tier 2 to mid-to-high Tier 3. I completely understand why they didn't issue a balance change to Big Priest for a long time: the meta was largely able to push Big Priest out, the Barnes nerf just pushed it over the edge.
---
Sn1p-Sn4p however has been Tier 1 / Tier 0 ever since SoU was released, a lot of it due to Plague of Flames. Strong players can nullify the decks weaknesses. It's simply on another level compared to Big Priest.
---
As Vicious Syndicate writes:
---
&gt; This deck boasts an incredible matchup spread that becomes flawless at higher levels of play and heavily suggests a steep learning curve and a high skill cap. Unlike Naga Warlock, SN1P-SN4P doesn‚Äôt lose to aggressive decks. In fact, it doesn‚Äôt lose to anything: its worst matchup is the mirror! Not only is it the best deck in the game, but it might also be better than Tier 1. There‚Äôs a strong argument that it is Tier S.
---
Team Rankstar:
---
&gt; SN1P-SN4P Warlock is up there with some of the most oppressive decks to ever grace the game, like Jade Druid, Beta Miracle Rogue, and Midrange Shaman. It‚Äôs almost impossible to beat SN1P-SN4P Warlock consistently. Apart from Exodia/Freeze Mage, not a single deck in the game has a 60% winrate against it, and Exodia Mage dies to everything else. 
---
Tempo Storm:
---
&gt; SN1P-SN4P Warlock might just be the most oppressive and consistent combo deck we have ever seen. With upwards of three different and flexible win conditions, it is very difficult to completely derail the list from panning out and taking consistent wins. Even the most consistent counters are only favored by a slight margin due to the matchups being draw dependent most of the time.
---
In the beginning, Hearthstone was formless and empty. And Blizzard said, "Let there be cards," and there were cards. Blizzard saw that cards were good.  Then Blizzard said, "Let us make SN1P-SN4P in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over all of Hearthstone." And so Blizzard kept a close eye on all that SN1P-SN4P had done, and, behold, it was very good.
---
it's a kid card game but i enjoy play it anyway.
---
i just can't understand when people talk trash about wild and keep playing cancerous deck. then, you are part of the problem and not really someone who is improving it's behaviour.
---
Man, Blizzard's communities are really bad, both for WoW and HS.
---
Obviously it wasn't a lie because they banned a shit load of people abusing it.  I mean, they still haven't done anything about it, but they're obviously watching it.
---
And probably laughing.
---
They should put the "not below 1" clause on every card that reduces mana cost. It would save us from so many infinite combos.
---
I've enjoyed quite a few metas personally. My favorite was Old Gods, closely followed by Ungoro and post aggro shaman nerf Gadgetzan. I think the thing that made those metas great was the strong diversity of different styles. You had aggro decks, mid-range decks, combo decks and control decks, all roughly equal in power level, all capable of beating each other and that lead to just about every game being competitive.
---
Metas that suck are ones that have a lot of games where you queue into an opponent that's playing a deck that just beats yours by virtue of their game plan and you know you've lost before you even play a card.
---
The original shamanstone was aggro and midrange shaman in One Night in Kharazhan and it didn't run evolve.
---
&gt; then you're fine to do so "As long as the content is not disparaging, vulgar, disrespectful, inappropriate, or abusive then it‚Äôs fine."
---
Isn't that language basically identical to the language in the competition rules that they used to ban Blitzchung?
---
Basically, that "liberate Hong Kong" is a message that is disrespectful to the points of view of the CCP according to Blizzard?
---
So I wouldn't count your chickens before they hatch. Good luck getting in.
---
Edit: Found the rule they claimed he violated:
---
&gt; Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard‚Äôs sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image
---
I assume the "offends a portion or group of the public" is the one they stuck him with. Which the language you gave could be used in the same way, if they decide your t-shirt is "disrespectful" they can ban you.
---
unstoppable force vs immovable object
---
Strongly agree. There are only a few exceptions to the rule, so it shouldn't take too long to fix them. 
---
Which means they probably never will.
---
Yah I agree with almost everything they said. Snip snap lock is unbeatable if it draws what it needs. And it has inevitability against a lot of decks. The deck is a problem.
---
I wonder why it hasn't been touched or even talked about much. I guess the high skill ceiling has kept it from grabbing too much attention.
---
I beat 146 bosses with priest on kobolds and catacombs so eh
---
The biggest tip I can give you is find a group that shares similar desires with you regarding what you want out of the average game.
---
r/EDH has a metric ton of threads about playgroups not liking a certain commander or playstyle, or one player constantly bringing relatively overpowered decks to the table. So if you can find your niche and a group that will let you enjoy that, you will have fun.
---
Ok, I will admit you have a good point. I agree it could be anticipated, but still - was it to the point it was "obvious"? 
---
I just don't think we can predict any meta with 100% certainty, and I like the fact that the Hearthstone team took the risk - on the condition they would fix it if it proved to be a mistake.
---
"***Interactive play"***
---
I think the ideal meta is a bit of everything, but toned down. Most stupid metas have been with decks that can do their thing too well. That means no insane dk cards, no 4 mana 7/7s, no who am I's and no 5 mana gadgetzan auctioneers.
---
Another thing that kind of puzzles me is why every class should have tools to build every kind of deck. Hunter was fine as an aggro/midrange hybrid only class. Mage was fine as a class that primarily fought the board with spells, not with giants and summoning shit.
---
I personally have always loved the aspect of managing your resources. Getting turn 5 lethal isnt very fun and interactive.
---
Oh...
---
As I said, it wasnt initially but thing from below would like a word with you. Also evolve was part of most of shamanstone especially once it became a midrange deck
---
Edh is best format. If you want to chat about it, hit me up
---
I‚Äôm not saying we can predict any or every meta with 100% certainty.
---
I‚Äôm saying that Blizzard should‚Äôve know better, this time, about this specific card.
---
Because it happened before.
---
It‚Äôs not some predictive argument, like they should have seen this coming, its literally happened already.
---
Making a mistake is fine.
---
Making the EXACT mistake twice is inexcusable.
---
My opinion.
---
Shaman quest changes your hero power to all battlecries trigger twice this turn. All it requires is playing 6 minions with battlecry, easy to dry by turn 4 and it just snowballs from there.
---
Mostly all of the new quests are stupid OP. Kinda makes me want to quit the game when they just keeping making the cards more imbalanced and overpowered.
---
What if I already have a free arena ticket left over? If I leave this one unfinished, will I get a second free ticket?
---
Hmm, good idea. I guess I'll just leave this run at 11-2 and move along then
---
Un'Goro was pretty good.
---
Tethiss#2358 - quest exchange - EU / done
---
Dragon expansion confirmed, and with the choose sides theme i'm guessing it's EVIL dragons vs good dragons working with the League.
---
Something tells me that Galakrond is going to be a neutral legendary that summons zombie dragons based on the wiki's description "Galakrond was not always this large and he used to have a smoother, more streamlined appearance.[\[9\]](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Galakrond#cite_note-9) His mutations were caused by cannibalizing on other proto-dragons, and as a by-product of his absorption of the proto-dragons' life essence his victims came back as [undead](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Undead), called the [not-living](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Not-living). "
---
Wait so am I never allowed to draw any of my good cards? Ever?
---
&gt; They don't want any politics
---
And yet their knee-jerk overreaction (particularly with regard to banning the casters) showed that this was not about keeping politics out of Blizzard events, it was about making sure the CCP's wrath didn't rain down on Blizzard for permitting this to happen. It was about punishing anyone who may have incurred the CCP's wrath on Blizzard's behalf. That makes it political in nature.
---
If his political statement was about anything other than Hong King or Tibet, say, maybe he made a statement about the Armenian Genocide. Do you think Blizzard would've reacted with the same harshness, including banning the casters who permitted it to be said?
---
Blizzard didn't distance themselves from politics, they dove in like a trained monkey ready to please the master by squashing this dissent without even being asked. (At least, one can only assume China didn't demand this. They may have done so through back channels, but the perception is that this was Blizzard acting to pre-emptively protect themselves from backlash from the Chinese government.)
---
Personally, I'm not mad about the reaction. I'm mad about the severity of it, because it betrays different motives than the ones they publicly claim.
---
Reading this made me think of Legends of Runeterra with how their legendaries can upgrade themselves once you complete an objective. Kinda like a mix of Quests and Spellstones but some cards can already be upgraded once the requirements are met.
---
 "can also talk fluent german and english"
---
You know, when the trailer for the first expansion came out I thought to myself ''I'd nose fuck Madam Lazul'' but as more and more art of her started to come out and after this trailer I'm starting to regret my opinion.
---
The best comment is always in the comments
---
I figured it out, now that you mentioned the Arugal who I discounted at first.
---
Opponent had mogu, 1 thunderhead, and probably spirit of the frog on the board.
---
They played zap, which drew the evolve and created 2 sparks. 
---
They played evolve, which turned mogu into akali and 1 spark into Arugal.
---
Akali overkilled something, which drew and buffed 1 mogu, which triggered Arugal, which created a second, unbuffed mogu, and played both of them. 
---
Vargoth replayed zap and zapped a target, most likely Akali since it has 1 health left. 
---
TLDR; f shaman
---
That is something I can totally see Dr.Boom doing.
---
Ooo I had no idea
---
Do you actually play Yugioh or are you just on that ygo hate train. Cause seriously the game is really healthy right now and we have reached the promised land called turn 6.
---
Everyone's definition of fun is different. Most people would say that control decks are un-fun. Aggro stopping greedy decks is a thing for any CCG in existence. I don't know of a single one that doesn't have the Aggro-Midrange-Control-Combo-Tempo distinctions, and they all provide important pieces to a meta.
---
You'd have to find a CCG built with a resource/gameplay foundation so fundamentally different that there's no place for those archetypes.
---
So..there it is, huh. Explorers and EVIL joining forces against a greater evil?
---
Also, Lazul is somewhere cold in Azeroth. Northrend based expansion again?
---
This teaser brought to you in crystal clear 1 FPS.
---
Yeah, it's getting repetitive, but they have to close the story. I'm looking forward to a new one too, but I wanna know how this one ends. End they can't do two expansion stories, when there is a three expansion zodiac circleü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Could be. But there has to be DRAGONS!
---
Well, there you go, 2 2-drops, 3 4-drops, and 2 8-drops on turn 3. Seems fair
---
See there you go. Just had to chirp in. My point has been made.

Chirp in? Is that what you call a response?
---
Your point is what again? That the Toronto media doesn‚Äôt talk enough about McDavid?
---
How did I make that point?
---
You honestly seem borderline retarded.
---
I choose freedom of speech
---
What, in your opinion, is a fair deck? Which current deck do you think every deck should be similar to balance wise?
---
I mean, every new player probably uses it because it got auto replaced default and they don‚Äôt really care enough to replace.
---
See whatcha did there ;)
---
Dragons. Wyrmest temple. Deathwing/Cataclysm theme possibly? If that's true I'll die laughing because that will mean Trump really did leak the expansion all that time ago
---
Naa China will just get a different feed of only the stage and clapping people
---
oh there's probably going to be some hoping to show up in a twitch clip.
---
I think people can live with the chanting, it's just more so rude and impolite in a larger spectrum when it comes to people trying to enjoy the con for what it is: a celebration of video games.
---
I can - and will - be angry if there are people sitting next to me screaming FREE HONG KONG while I'm trying to listen to a presentation. I'll be mad if the people in front of me are standing trying to get the attention of the camera or guard.  I support HK and have been disgusted with Blizzard ever since this ordeal started, but my friend and I have been saving and planning for Blizzcon for the whole last year into this one. It's disruptive, and I won't be shocked if people get into arguments because some people just want to enjoy the con.
---
That's why I think it'd be better if people protested loudly and verbally outside, and kept the protests inside more visual and quiet  (Signs, shirts, pins, etc) as to not disturb the people that are these to just enjoy the con for what it is.
---
OTOH, the Druid cards from Rise of Shadows featured the crystal dryads and Keeper... Which are *only* found in Crystalsong Forest.
---
How big are these?
---
As far as i know you keep your free tickets, but i'm not 100% sure about that. Second, you should actually not finish your run. Play until you have two losses and then let the run expire. That way you get the rewards for your wins and a ticket for another run :)
---
Yeah maybe you should spend some time walking in other people's shoes because it seems like you're really close minded. Also you're acting like you're 12 years old.
---
And yeah maybe they are lazy and they don't want to deal with it that's their prerogative.
---
In short no.
---
Its still being played,its still being supported,still get tournaments and all. 
---
You can argue with its dying or stagnating or less people then in past(but we dont have full data like blizz does so cant fully prove evrything) but Its certainly not dead.
---
HS will be dead when servers stop being used and no more updates. Whcih is not case,so not dead
---
ur net issue, maybe u can use vpn or swap into data
---
I'm one of those rank 5-legend home brewers :D
---
Edit: there's just so many cool things to try in wild
---
The problem isn't with SnipSnap though. The problem is the ability to cheat out a minion with Echo for 0 mana. Thus creating essentially infinite minions. Any effect that causes an aura of discount should definitely work the way summoning portal does. Minimum of (1) cost.
---
I could see Team 5 doing another MSoG thing, I‚Äôm just curious how it‚Äôll translate in the solo adventure, and how the winner is decided.
---
Fair enough. I guess heroes are good if they just give a big swing turn and supply a new "interesting" hero power that isn't necessarily a huge upgrade or win condition.  
---
They might actually be the safest way to design a big swing turn because they can't be cheated out or duped/reshuffled after being played.  
---
It would be cool to see some *harmful* hero powers. Like, in exchange for some big swing or cool weapon you have an auto-cast HP that does increasing damage to you each turn.
---
id love for wild ones aswell.
---
Many cards have unique/intereng effects but always had to high cost/to low stats(or both) even in past.
---
One in every three games is fairly consistent, mate. A deck with a 50% winrate when it doesnt get the combo by 5 and 100% when it does would have a 67% WR, given one in three games.
---
The alternating orange/purple glow of the cards made me think it has something to do with legendary/epic rarities. No idea *what*, but it seems vaguely plausible. Maybe they‚Äôll announce that epics can be disenchanted for enough dust to craft a  legendary? Probably not, but one can dream!
---
That, or it‚Äôs just supposed to represent the League of EVIL/Explorers (or something else entirely), but baseless speculation is what these threads are for, right?
---
I have an idea that most don't agree with, but I feel once you've discovered something, you shouldn't be offered it again in the same match. That or reduce the chance of it so severely it may as well be nothing.
---
All I care about are Santa hats. Especially the one on sneaky snake (does they have a name?).
---
Did you get a free thicket last week too? I did for the first two weeks, but not for the third.
---
I'd stay away for a week or so. An emergency ban for *something* in Green is almost definitely imminent if someone doesn't smash the meta apart with an unexpected deck. Oko/Food decks are seemingly tier 0. Plus WotC basically said the only reason they didn't ban Oko was they wanted to see if the meta dealt with him soon; thus far the meta has been "run Oko decks but also hate cards for the other Oko decks".
---
I think there's a clear middle path to follow.  I love Blizzard games and I'm thrilled to be attending BlizzCon, but I also think their actions against BlitzChung were reprehensible.  I think it's important to communicate that fans of the games disapprove of those actions, albeit in a respectful way that doesn't ruin the experience for others.
---
Yeah Mogu is a badly designed card I think.
---
I'm not. I've been loving this set of expansions and love the idea of following through an arc across a year. Awesome stuff
---
no snipsnap is issue not other cards.
---
Yeah and buffs can change up for both format and help out archetypes that just need that little push or inspire to create it. Like glownstone technican and crystlogy buff and the new deck helper )people likly still wouldnt have had had the aggro handbuff pally around.
---
or just give new life to forgotten cards in general.
---
Looked like Lazul had the same card in her hand the whole time
---
That's bullshit.  There has been no correlation down the years between how expensive the deck is and how long it has taken to nerf.  SnipSnapLock is a cheap deck!  It contains zero epics and 5 legendaries.  Of the 5 legendaries, one was given to everyone for free and two others are so widely used that pretty much everyone has them.  Most players can just craft Soularium and Glinda and they're good to go!
---
would recommend proxies if you doin casual :)
---
"Powerful wind". I feel like they could make that a little more awe-inspiring
---
Tired of MTG? Join us in Yu-gi-oh!, Where the Meta goes +5 in a Turn.
---
*Don't stick your dick in crazy!*
---
Post-nerf Witchwood was great.  A new good deck popped up every week.  Everything was kinda broken, but it was balanced that way.  Every class had something unique to offer, often multiple somethings.  Baku and Genn were powerful but hadn't gotten stale just yet.
---
But tbh, for me personally the utopic meta is one where value/control Hunter is viable but underrated, since that's the deck I always gravitate toward.  I liked early RoS because I could play my Zuljin deck to crush Warriors, with enough lifegain and taunt to play the game against Rogue.  I liked Rastakhan before Spellstone was nerfed because my Kathrena deck beat the other Hunter decks.  I didn't mind Boomsday, since Secret Plan was a great upgrade to Spell Hunter and Cubelock was gone.
---
Yes exactly, cards like bounty hunter for example its that type of dumb bad rng that plagued the game.
---
Man, can't wait for everyone to forget about Blizzard's pandering to china when this drops.
---
This looks awesome
---
Agreed it‚Äôs a fucking annoyance. They need to increase the amount of turns you need to have unspent mana or do what they did with the heart and make it cost 2.
---
What? Lol
---
The pay to play system is not a flaw at all. Basically the rng mechanics suck, almost all of them are really unfun and basically a coinflip where one player wins and the other gets frustrated.
---
Added you
---
That one too, but I was talking the Hour of Twilight dungeon
---
Dungeon run is the whole reason I play. I love all of the new modes too. Even rumble.
---
Most decks that used it could do both, since there were only a limited amount of either effect and Sunfury Protector is a generally good card.
---
Yes once you go below 20 it will be much faster
---
False sense of accomplishment. People like that have been around since the first meta and will be until the last. Easy to hijack your reward system
---
Yes, plenty of tier 1 and tier 2 options.
---
You're playing a greedy control deck and you are losing to a greedier control deck.  That's the way it goes.  You could tech in Mind Visions and steal their scheme from them so you are both playing many N'Zoths.
---
You can't blame people for wanting to play the best decks. Although I do agree that it's super annoying. 
---
I will also say, the Shaman decks are so busted right now that you can't even play fun decks. I really enjoy N'Zoth Rogue because it can beat control decks, but no one is playing control when you can just play Shaman and win the game fast. 
---
Heck, 8/10 of the top decks from rank 5-legend are aggressive/aggressive midrange decks. Tooooo much aggro right now. 
---
Control warrior was a mess up until the nerfs, but that's just one class and it wasn't nearly as present as shaman is currently. It's just a big mess of fast decks.
---
You should've played sandbringer first into zephrys so you have 4 Mana remaining for the mass dispel or hex
---
I think that that's an illusion. Zeph's code only cares about basic and classic cards and that shouldn't have changed. He's still looking for the same conditions. The trick is that you have to point him in the direction of the desired outcome.
---
Aztaraxxis#1906 NA trading 80 gold quest. I‚Äôll show, you go first.
---
getting tired of the Islander voodoo juju thing, it's gotten old
---
This map kind of ruins current azeroth for me as someone who spent many years staring at the map with no islands in WoW. Pandaria was a HUGE controversy because people were like "yo they spent all this time going back and forth between continents without running into this massive island?" And blizzard had to explain that it was shrouded, so fine whatever. And now there's like 100 more islands that noone happened to ever find in the middle there?
---
Evolve is 3 year old card that didn't get nearly as much complaining back when it was initially released.
---
The problem is not evolve, there are new cards that have been released in the time since it rotated out of standard which synergize better with it and probably weren't designed with this specific event in mind.
---
Stop whining.
---
I mean not impossible, but seems unlikely to me, they would have to still develop both sides by now and scrapping one because it got less votes would be inefficient
---
nope .i quit AROUND that period i rmb genn and baku got in hall of champions? or qhatever it 2as called i forgot. 
---
but i quit because its a pain to get new cards w a new rotation and was generally f2p didnt have much money.
---
But, again, there aren't any other one-card combos that happen when they are reduced to 0 mana.  Reducing most cards to 0 allows you to play combinations maybe, or it gives strong tempo.  But having one zero-cost card does not win the game on its own.  Emperor is good if you hit Naturalize + Elise + three other cards, you get the idea.  It's not good if you just hit Elise.
---
Like the Priest deathrattle card.  It wasn't a problem when it was reducing Devilsaur eggs, but as soon as you could pay 5 mana to play infinite Snipsnaps, they had to prematurely ban it.  Snipsnap uniquely exploits cost reduction in a way other cards don't.
---
I forgot the word "than" in that first comment. Thanks for pointing out the error.
---
It's probably called something dumb and cheezy like "Dragonblight Fight!"
---
That's a shame.
---
the problem is that its not particularly fun to die turn 5. i know blizzard wants to appeal to quick mobile gamers instead of people who spend longer amounts of time on the computer, but nobody is entitled to have turn 5, 2 minute games.
---
this is something i feel like people are wishing for and its simply not enjoyable for the other side. aggressive decks are fine but they shouldt regularly end games that fast. people shouldt just be able to race through games like that, no matter how much people want turn 5 lethal.
---
especially considering that control is supposed to counter aggro, so aggro isent supposed to beat control on turn 5 normally.
---
Is this game not f2p friendly?
---
I'm legend though üôÑ
---
dragon pally
---
Well, if you did, you wouldn't need to have made a burner reddit account and make your irritation and salt fueled stupidity obvious to all.
---
With N'Zoth Priest?
---
This would breathe new life into the game for sure, notably for casual players. Wasn't this something they mentioned years ago in a Q&amp;A?
---
Rafaam actually mentions that he had taken something important for his plan at the final conversation with Tekhan.
---
OSHate#2219 EU 80g, don't ming going first if you show me the quest
---
Is this the announcement of the announcement?  Or just a teaser for the announcement announcement?
---
*bot
---
I want them to implement no mirror class matches
---
I survived th Hong Kong incident, I did not survive the shaman stone follow up.
---
Yeah iirc Tekahn helped invade Dalaran and in exchange for Rafaam unleashing the plagues. That was their deal which is probably the reason EVIL went to Uldum
---
I was literally doing this las night Mechathun for classes that he removes cards from
---
'Pandaria' makes me mad every time i read its name. Blizz pandering to China 10 years before it was cool
---
I say we stop taking the fun out of mechanics. Removing the bonus also made discover less cool. I think fixes should go to cards, no to cool mechanics.
---
any pics of the gf?
