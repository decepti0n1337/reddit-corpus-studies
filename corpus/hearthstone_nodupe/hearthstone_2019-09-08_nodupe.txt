Sounds like you've had some bad luck. I've been playing wild since the format first came out from every rank between 25-5 and I've never ran into the same deck 11 times in a row.
---
What about mage quest lol
---
No because there were taunts in the way which would've negated an effective trade.
---
Only because the animation system is so bad. When cheating is removing slow animations I feel it's more about the system beeing bad than the cheat abusing something problematic - not saying this isn't cheating though.
---
Fuck screenshots, right?
---
this guy gets two millhouses and complains
---
yes anxiety is a thing, but it goes away the more you play. trust me. so start playing like 20 games in a row and you'll see your anxiety goes lower and lower.
---
How does hsreplay know what cards get removed from tracking casted from Zuljin then?
---
Thanks! I have never actually seen anyone play this quest in game.
---
i’m playing control priest

quest druid is free win most of the time

Welcome to the wild, where we meet our old dear cards to play again.
---
of course it is CN players
---
No, since Drawing Blood is part of your four cards, using it would give you 6 cards total.
---
2 Random Cards + 2 Drawing Bloods.
---
Use A drawing blood
---
4 Random Cards + 1 Drawing Blood
---
Use A Drawing Blood
---
6 Random Cards + 0 drawing bloods = 6 cards total in hand
---
&gt; the problem of it being resurrected early wouldn't exist, would it?
---
My point is that even if the opponent hits a "dud" like Vargoth early, they can still come out on top. The Y'shaarj point is more that every class can deal with it. But overall I'm pointing out that the rez cards are more problematic than the cards that end up rezzed or the one that kicks it off.
---
Highlander priest sounds fun!
---
Yeah its some bullshit unfun card mechanics but hearthstone has alot of that these days

I assume his card text would read "Wish for a solidly meh card!"

The MULLIGAN GUIDE is easy ALWAYS keep murmy, tidecaller, and at least one Mogu if he’s there. Reason being, they have the highest win rates across all of Shaman so keeping them alone ups your chances of winning. Don’t keep mutate unless you have Mogu I know it’s 
---
tempting. 
---
Pretty easy game plan, just try and play on curve and keep as many of your murlocs alive as possible. You’d think this deck wants to just go face but it wants the board kinda like zoo. The difference between my deck and zoo however is that with the murloc synergy, a big board, and a warleader you basically just played a better savage roar that stays. That was a shit example but you get the gist. 
---
REMEMBER BOARD&gt;FACE UNTIL YOU HAVE LETHAL SETUP 
---
This deck CAN beat any deck in this meta without a doubt. This deck IS NOT a super consistent deck, but if you mulligan well you will still win most of your games. You WILL NOT beat quest shaman if you haven’t dealt some serious damage by the time they finish the quest. Same goes for quest Druid. This deck smacks both of them 90% of the time tho I feel. I played it from ranks 4- Legend 93. If this deck gets a bad hand it will get that ass tapped you have been warned. Also if murloc paladin gets the combo down early, concede lol. 
---
I would not recommend substitutes. The changes I made from traditional murloc shaman (EX: No soul of the murloc, no scargil, etc.) were because they had low deck winrates and the cards I put in (EX: Mogu, Mutate, Leroy, Siamat) were because those cards have really good deck winrates right now and they fit the midrange/Aggro style of this deck. 
---
One last thing, THIS IS A MIDRANGE DECK! Why do I say that? Because Underbelly and Tastyfin alone mean you SHOULD always have some cards in your hand to play on curve and eventually overwhelm your opponent. Anyways, dm me if you have questions! HAVE FUN GOOD LUCK!
---
Is this game like yugioh
---
50/50 chance of getting the real thing.

That's a powerful deck, if only I had the legendaries, I have about half of them but I'd rather not use something half-baked. Thanks for the suggestion though.

I mean, yeah. 29 card deck. Why not include it?
---
Probably
---
Rule 5: Tolin's Goblet and a lucky Walking Fountain off of a Mutate turned a certain loss into a gorilla monsoon.
---
Lol
---
My favorite strategy against priest. Since I usually play quest rogue, I just clear dangerous things and sap sticky threats.  It's hilarious when I finally throw down Tess and shuffle twenty copies into my deck.
---
What happens to the stats if it’s included in a deck like Silence Priest?
---
They changed those style of cards to be able to be used on 1 minion as well.
---
"Can't be targeted by spells or Hero Powers" literally means that. No one can target it with them. Not that they are immune to effects from spells. Random effects don't "target" minions they just happen.
---
Okay, I am missing something then. I'm still salty about it though.
---
Not only that, the random targeting means that it's legal. Think of it like an AOE that hits 2.
---
Well that's depressing.
---
Dont feel bad i have every card youd ever need and i suck.

Shoutouts to reckless rocketeer, winning me dozens of games in place of Leeroy, who I disenchanted in my first month of playing this game before I knew how monstrously retarded that was.

Would be too busted though because of abusive/blessing of might etc. Especially with magic carpet in standard
---
This was the point I also wanted you to notice. When people play games, their real life is somehow linked to the virtual life. To err is what makes a human. So, don't be afraid of failure either in real life or virtual. You play the game for fun, and not for frustration. In the beginning, I also used to face the same problem. But now I hit legend every month in first 3-4 days with easy win streak. The key is in focusing on the possibility of every move in a turn and predicting what your opponent can and can not play. Since nowadays people just copy meta decks, it makes easy for the rest to understand and predict what the other player can play. Enjoy the learning- whether it's from winning or losing.
---
...and I thought Brann's moves were horribad.
---
Imagine if that was a reliable enough solution that murloc paladin wasn't carrying such a large win rate.
---
Quest warlock you have no chance.  Commit to zoo if you want to beat it and even then it's almost 50/50.  
---
https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/157/murloc-paladin#tab=matchups  
---
There is murloc paladin and there is the decks that can beat it.
---
Any chance we can get a deck code?
---
We're talking aggro decks here. No aggro decks run thalnos cause a 2 mana 1/1 is awful (obviously bar shaman but that's the exception not the rule) 
---
However a 1 mana 1/1 deathrattle draw a card might be good enough, who knows. Both would probably be included in any deck that plays a lot of cycle cards
---
Id say 4 mana is probably where it's at its strongest
---
I’m a mobile player and I’m lazy so no, but if it gets popular enough maybe hahaha
---
Wisp is objectively better, unless you play some sort of rng card where the Wisp may get in the way
---
Yeah but *I’m* lazy
---
Yeah, I agree. Playing a card should add time to your turn counter. Not a lot, just around 5 seconds. Just enough that if you can go infinite, you go infinite.
---
Idk, personally I think 4 or 5 would be the strongest iteration overall.
---
Another comparison could be acolyte of pain, usually max 3 draws with a 1/3 body that has seen tons of play for draw oriented decks
---
Dude can you imagine 3 mana 3/3 that draws 3 lol. Auto include in every deck that ever until rotation.
---
Not if you want to advance in ladder it's not.  
---
It's got so many bad matchups in the current meta you would get slaughtered with it.  
---
Can't say I watched the GM or when it was but no doubt he had a plan for taking that deck through (did he get far?)
---
Half the mana is a HUGE discount 1 mana cards are so much better than 2 mana cards when they are similar.
---
1 mana 2/3 no text &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 mana 2/3 with a slight bonus like gain 2 life.
---
Injured Warrior
---
Worse than Counterfeit Coin in every way
---
[Youtuber/Streamer Chump recently posted a Tempo/Taunt Warrior list featuring Octosari.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC1IIKau2zk)
---
It can also work quite well in a more combo/burn style of face warrior. (The combo portion being Bloodsworn Mercenary, Inner Rage, and Charge Minion for 12 - 16 damage out of hand.)
---
We have found the next keleseth
---
i mean yeah. but typically your not going miss the card draw from loot hoarder. and if they waste some type of silence removal or a bounce effect like sap on it then its worth imo.

---
p2w!
---
Is there a flair that will insult you personally
---
Great question. I wish I could say - maybe just because of how aggravating the whole process of losing is, even if there's nothing I can do about it. 
---
I take a lot of pride in my games and I have such a personal connection with them that it makes me feel like a bad person when I lose. E.g. if I'm bad at the game I'm bad at life
---
Only your opponent starts with a treasure chest.
---
Ah the salty tears of aggro players my favorite
---
Would still be good, but starting to get more midrangey.
---
A 1 Mana 1/1 deathrattle draw one is definitely good, but I think it's stronger at 3 or 4 mana. In most decks the draw isn't an awkward amount, and aggro gets a solid body that gives a ton of gas, as opposed to a 1/1 that replaces itself.
---
welcome to Wild Hearthstone my friend! just don't be nasty to Secret Mages, I did use the deck too but now I can play my meme decks at bottom rank 5!

WAAAAH. #G O L D E N L E G E N D A R Y!
---
Hell yeah brother. I stopped buying when Yogg stopped being fun. My creativity/interest for the game died.
---
I feel that aggressive decks occasionally top off at around 6 mana. Having a 6 mana 6/6 reload 6 cards is something that is will be run for aggressive decks which tend to lose steam at turn 6ish. So 6 is still playable in my books.
---
7 onwards might be something that doesn't fit anywhere. Too high a mana cost for aggro (i have only seen aggressive decks run 1 7 mana card in the history of hearthstone and that is dr. Boom), and too much card draw for non aggressive decks.
---
Wait... turn 6? Thats late af. Try turn 4.

When I play, they usually get Catarina Muerte..

Hey NFDragon24, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "Petition". Calling a thread a petition is essentially a subtle request for agreement upvotes, and petition threads generally tend to be poor prompts for constructive discussion.

What's the hero power?
---
Technically that and holy wrath adds up to an ultimate infestation.
---
Is this a copy paste template?
---
When was the last time you visited HS on reddit?
---
&gt;  partly attributed to veterans who refuse to climb.
---
I'm pretty sure those are people who netdecked a meta deck and have no idea what their doing.
---
Card draw is often valued at closer to 2 mana per extra card in the classic and basic sets. Arcane Intellect draws 2 because you pay 1 mana plus a card to draw the first (1 mana cycles with any relevant minor upside are good enough to play, see pre-nerf Flare), then 2 mana to draw the 2nd card, pre-nerf Nourish pays 4 mana to draw 2 extra cards, Sprint pays 6 mana to draw 3 extra cards; Novice Enginner is 2 mana more than a Wisp to draw a card, likewise for Shiv vs Moonfire. 
---
The fact that 0-mana cards do things should make it clear that it doesn't make sense to simply divine effect by mana cost when evaulating cards, since the fact you use up a card at all is a cost, and grants something (about 1 mana's worth if it were an extra effect on another card) by itself before you add more power with the mana cost. This makes cheaper cards generally more mana efficient than mid-cost cards. However, the rules change again with 7+ mana cards, since most constructed viable high-cost cards need to be more mana efficient than mid-cost cards in order to justify including a card that can only be played later in the game, and don't allow much if any mana to do other things in the same turn.
---
Well, you don’t need /s because his decks are awful
---
You can craft a viable Murloc Shaman or Zoo warloc for 2000-4000 dust. Those are the best options you have if you're starved for resources. But those are meta decks and people will call you a "noob bully" on reddit if you play them.
---
An important point is knowing when you start to gain momentum and the opponent and then focusing on whether the priority is to shut down there early game spike or push yours/push early game and face as late game its a lost cause.
---
One of the biggest things for me is trying to ask yourself what they could do next and where that leaves you
---
Also made it "At the end of **each** turn." rather than "At the end of your turn."
---
So, breaking the card entirely, which I would hope is a mistake.
---
3 Mana 40/46 SeemsGood
---
One isn't that op considering it's a legendary but 2 - 6 is op
---
Any deck with god draws is broken.
---
He implies that "veterans" or "noob bullies" are camping ranks 20 for whatever reason solely to farm wins for "newbies" even though "newbies" start at 50.  
---
The whole argument is rather ludicrous at best.  How it's getting upvoted is beyond me but then he's preaching to the choir so I"m not surprised.  
---
I mean the part about "the influx of new players is so low in this game." is the stupidest part of it all as how could he possibly know this?  Very well might be their are less and less veterans playingand new players remains steady (more likely in fact with how disenfranchised older players are like to be and the general positive posts we get here from new players).
---
Rank 25 is literally half way ... why wouldn't there be meta decks?  
---
People can easily ccraft 1 by 25 and if you are interested in climbing to get better rewards this is the smart thing to do.  
---
I'm sorry this isn't the game you can play ranked with some meme deck and do well but then ... what CCG is?
---
OP isn't implying skill though, he's just whinging about net decks.
---
&gt;the only edge your opponents have is how many broken cards they drafted
---
Implies luck to me, not skill.
---
That's not true at all.  If you jsut followed say heartharena and just drafted accordingly you will not average 7 wins.  That's an outright fallacy.  
---
There is a large element of skill involved in both drafting and play.  Arena is by far the most skilled aspect to HS.
---
Agreed.
---
I believe he implied he had to spend to get into wild though i.e. bought X adventure instead of Y.    
---
You still need to spend to get into wild if you don't have a wild collection to begin with.  
---
There is an argument to be had it will cost you less in the long run if you ignore standard though and that will probably be true over time.
---
It was really good for its time, though powercreep has kinda made his insane power level kinda normal right now.
---
I'm not going to argue with you. I will defend myself however. I've been playing paper magic since New Phyrexia, since then I've sold my collection twice. The first time I used the money to pay off a car, the second I payed off 3 credit cards and bought a gun. That just isnt possible in hs, unless you want to start totally fresh on a brand new account. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/mRKHmil
---
In magic it's all about what and when you buy. You most definitely can get your money back, maybe not 100% but depending on what and when you buy and when you sell you can get at least 50-60% for sure.

Over the last 4 years I've  been building this deck. I've spent roughly 1500$ the current market price is 4000$. In the last 2 years I've probly spent 200$ on hs and I know that that money is gone forever.
---
4 mana 7/7
---
At 1 mana it would be ok.
---
At 2 mana would have legendary value (a tiny but better than Thalnos i'd say).
---
At 3-6 mana it would be broken indeed
---
Quest shaman rules right now. Just mulligan everything for questing adventurer, novice engineer and cable rat and you should get carried by the deck honestly- it’s super simple. 
---
Remember to save certain cards for two card combos unless you’re desperate- for example, save Mutate for Giggling or the 5 mana 1/1, save a lackey in your hand if you gave Wasp, etc.
---
He gonna the N word
---
Trump is currently running it at 8 in his aggro Highlander. It's actually really good in the deck.
---
I reckon it pretty much peaks at 5...
---
The best would be 11 or higher
---
1 op
---
2 op
---
3 op
---
4 pretty good
---
5 pretty good
---
6 above average
---
7 bad
---
This card is op at pretty much any mana cost between 3 and 7. Above 7 it's too slow and wouldn't really see play, also that's too many cards being drawn to really handle. At 1 and 2 mana it'd be a staple in many decks, but not to the extent it was op. At 0 mana it would destroy universes with its power level.
---
Handcuff Paladin in wild as an accelerator
---
&gt;Isn't there still some stipulation though?

From what I remember, they said they cannot include beasts with more than 3 lines of text because it would break the card text on the zombeast, so you're not far off!

---
it's in both highlander paladin and highlander aggro warrior
---
I don't think it'll be worth it.
---
Also remember the first wing is free so you'll probably get 3 packs from there anyways. You'll be paying $20 for 13 packs and a random legendary.
---
Ok.. I understand now little bit more, how it works. 
---
I just assumed its coordinates, because it works on desktop and on NB it doesn't.
---
Anyway thanks for your hard work. It is very useful script.
---
At lower values of n it becomes auto include in res priest and undahtakah decks I think.
---
Probably already taken but good job denying the bots
---
This is the same creep that has left disturbing comments on multiple channels featuring women, right?
---
PRIMITIVE
---
N'sari sounds like a middle easter name
---
It's OP, any aggro deck would include it. It's a full refill when you start to run out of steam on a strong body, it's an insanely good 3-5 drop, and most importantly, it's super flexible.
---
Obviously the galaxy Brain play here is making it 10 mana. You get an entirely new hand! And probably die to milling yourself.
---
Why are you posting a screenshot of an image?

:o
---
Yeah just realised. It still shows up but you dont get the extra star
---
Oh. Thats pretty lucky I guess.
---
You get this sort of spidey-sense that tells you the right time to play a card or to accelerate or slow down once you play long enough.
---
it peaks at 3-4, depending on the type of deck it's used in.

---
YOU learn more from losing. You learn more from WATCHING someone win. Otherwise I would be watching rank 20 streamers instead of watching legend players in order to improve.
---
I  play quest Rogue and i felt like the decks i win most against were shaman and druid but fell short against warrior and hunter.
---
Against shaman, they usually don't have any big removal for your big guys and you should usually finish the quest first and with that you can start pressuring them with permanent board control and face damage
---
For druid you can usually kill anything they try to bring up with the mirage blades, i have played against about 10 quest druids and only lost against 2 of them because i drew my big stuff first (Tess/ Toggwaggle).
---
Do you use internet explorer by any chance
---
Another way to make this card viable is to make it so that you choose a number between 1 and 5 then it'll have the stats of the number you picked eg: 5 mana 5/5 draw 5. This would make the card much more flexible and could be used in any deck. If its resurrected it would keep the stats you chose
---
I just got one though
---
ooh forgot about that. For some reason I haven't faced off against a zephrys once during this season, so it wasn't in my mind
---
At 2-5 I think it is nuts. After that it starts to diminish

That’s cool. Glad you like the quest as is.
---
I hate playing Murloc decks.. actually I hate being forced to play any specific deck to finish a quest.
---
is this official? havent played the game in a long time
---
I think it would be most broken at 3. A 3/3 for 3 that draws 3 cards just seems like the most efficient usage.
---
This is now gonna sound like a lie but i remembered the play was i played pit lisk, dealt the damage to HIS wurm, i predicted he would ran the wurm into my lisk and he did
---
They’re his wurms. That said, i still would’ve probably done this even if they were mine because i love arena suffering
---
3 or 4 value would be broken
---
&gt;Quest druid/Control warrior etc, you name it, it will be there gating rank 20

There is some part of luck and time invest in this game. You stop for a long time just pick some simple deck that focus on aggro or tempo based should be easier and try to open website when you see opponent deck to check what card or trick they can play also avoid combo or deck that required knowledge to pilot will make you better in climbing.
---
Literally can't even begin to understand this.

The way I see it, with the exclamation mark, its more like your friend telling you to watch and learn, rather than you actually watching and learning from their plays, like how people say it just as they’re about do something they think is amazing

Nice list.

Loving wild right now, secret mage numbers have gone a bit down past week.

We need more wild content on this subreddit.
---
But you learn the most from watching someone lose three times and then win once.
---
I view that quest as “Watch and Coach”.
---
Just saw this live. I wonder if Feno executed all the moves he wanted and the game engine just didn't accept all of them before the rope was over. On camera he seemed pretty confident that he did, and shocked when it turned out that he didn't. Could it be a matter of lag like Casie said?
---
Regarding this, there is another important fair play question: should Casie have conceded? I don't think the situation was not clear whether Feno had performed all of his moves on time without the game acknowledging them or simply a case of player error. But even if the situation was clear about the game engine bugging out, I don't remember any cases where someone conceded in an official live match as a sign of fair play.
---
shudder gives you more value in quest shaman. its a good way to come on board, generate minions and spells and do damage to the enemies board/hero
---
siamat doesnt come close in the deck you want to play
---
Just go with whatever class you're most comfortable with. The top 5 classes are close enough in winrate rn that player skill is a bigger determinant in winning games
---
Feels bad man :(
---
This sucks for Fenomeno and if what Cassie said about the Blizzard accounts' lag costing Feno the game, that's some bullshit.

However, the game before Cassie also roped on a difficult turn and missed a way to negate double Holy Wrath-Shirvallah.  At 7 mana, he could've gone Gloop + bees on a 5/4 + Innervate to guarantee an Elise on a Hidden Oasis + Innervate, which would've let him double Oasis the next turn for an extra 24 healing, and put him at 58 HP total factoring in the plays, and no way for Feno to deal that extra 8 damage due to the taunts.
---
While its horrible for Feno, it gets balanced out by Cassie missing effectively counter-Lethal the game before.  He wouldn't have been in that position if Cassie hadn't missed that line to begin with.
---
He played his turn too late and it didnt went off quick enough, so he couldnt finish his opponent.
---
Go face, dont trade. You can finish them with your hero power.
---
The key is to knot feel guilty.

You are truly evil sir

Assuming you're not talking about climbing to legend, with win-streaks you can easily climb back playing no more than a single game a day, assuming you play to win (so don't just do decks of 30 X cards for the quest) and that it's not February.
---
It was quite dramatic, but just a moment and not really the greatest if you remember various highlights (in Blizz championships or not) since the early days such as whole games of Kolento vs Strifecro, the sheer luck of Pavel, Ostkaka vs Thijs etc.
---
I actually think Shamans should have card generation as a strength because it feels like a mystical shaman thing to do. It baffles me that they list it as a stated class weakness. Granted, that doesn't mean that you're wrong to say that bottomless resources need to be toned down in HS overall.

#1 tip: make good decks
---
Exactly! And knowing all those things, I really think Faceless should have been a logical conclusion.
---
It's a pretty edge case because 1200 attack minions and armor in the thousands is not something you see every game, but offering three different single target removal options just seems redundant. I'm pretty sure Faceless was the only single card that could have turned the game in my favor. It would literally have been the perfect card.
---
What about them?
---
&gt; The animations aren't that slow.
---
I have to disagree. Having played Slay the Spire on fast mode, almost all the animations in Hearthstone feel interminable. Hearthstone could really use an optional fast mode as well.
---
There are no 1 or 2 decks far superior to the others right now...

No, there's still 4 weeks to go

Also consider, that shudderwock will rotate earlier than siamat will
---
So if you are a standard player, siamat with his neutrality is probably the way to go
---
Yeah I understand going into the tank and thinking, but what gets me is watching very good players try to take all the actions when the rope starts.  You just don't have time for that.  Make some of the obvious plays first.  Play wild pyro, silence the taunt, heal the team and see what you draw...That should have happened in the first 10 seconds of the turn.
---
A [[Scaled Nightmare]] from [[Geosculptor Yip]] could have possibly saved him.
---
I’m glad they decided to nerf extra arms. People were saying it was premature, but looking at the decks it would have been insanely oppressive.
---
Seems more like a post for blizzard, not hearthstone
---
And anotha one
---
On Twitter he said he was confused about which minion could still attack as well as he didn't have enough time for counting damage calculations. So it definitely wasn't a connection issue and it definitely isn't as heart breaking to see him miss the one attack.
---
By the time itd get high enough to do amh real damage hed have like 20/20 jades lol
---
What actual trashcan would feel good playing this deck. What a joke. You're proud of this? This is why I'd never play wild.
---
TechBoss1000#1421 80g quest trade NA, I'll show, you go first
---
I stopped having a problem with Zephyrs once I started to consciously recognize when I would be playing against a Highlander deck or not. When you know he's coming, he's pretty predictable (especially when your opponent is saving him for lethal).
---
Nope.
---
NA Quest trade 80g, I show you go first
---
Chrishky#2313
---
Faceless Lackey is all fun and games until he gives you Doomsayer.
---
Compared to most of the meta wild decks this is pretty garbage as you'll just die before you can pull off the combo that uses about a third of your deck and also needs a setup and lucky draws in order to work in the first place.
---
I don't even do this quest, because it's frequently a waste of time.
---
/r/WhereDidTheSodaGo
---
I totally have 200 friends and totally knew about the friend limit
---
Isn't plated beetle part of the combo?
---
So the small chance you win you still lose because it was by doing this.  GG have fun in wild.
---
Interesting, guess it must be some other issue then. But I do also only see it with a few specific cards that came out recently. The ones I can remember that exhibit that effect are Armagedillo, Rafaam, and Oblivitron.
---
r/SharedBPM
---
The mildly confusing part about it is that Shifting Scroll technically has a null mana cost, not zero. So you'd figure that'd just disqualify it from consideration.
---
Dude if you watch them lose then you learned on what NOT to do witch is also good to learn
---
Alright so this sounds crazy, but let's change it from doubling *health* to doubling *attack*, make it cost 5 Mana and make it a fucking Paladin spell! BOOM!
---
Learn to fucking play faster.
---
By adventures do you mean ones like ‘League of Explorers’, ‘Naxxramas’ etc.? If yes, you can no longer purchase them with gold (unless you purchased at least one wing of them). You would have to pay real money (usually around 20-30 dollar mark, not sure you have to check yourself) for them now. However they can only be used in wild mode. 
---
If you are talking about the more recent adventures such as ‘Dalaran Heist’ I think they are worth it for the single player experience if you get bored of multiplayer. I can’t say much about the game play experience of Dalaran Heist as I have only finished the first wing. Otherwise the rewards from Dalaran Heist aren’t really that amazing as compared to the single player content we had before (like League of Explorers).
---
I hate that spell
---
Tinker#2908 EU, looking for an 80g trade.
---
NA 80g Quest, Deke#11603, ill show but you go first
---
Yeah i was thinking more for the dala heist, i saw you can get a few packs per wing but if its more of just a PvE experience I'll just hold off for a while while i get a decent collection again.
---
Thanks again
---
So, can anyone explain to me why everyone feels sorry for Feno? He chose to spend time during his turn NOT making game actions.
---
I think there's a big difference between missing a play and spotting the play but not having the time to execute/game bugging/misclicking (whichever of the above it was). I like seeing people punished for the former, not the latter.
---
Math questions aren't quite the same thing as a card game with incomplete information and stochastic outcomes. Your friend can play perfectly and still lose but you still got to watch them make the right decision throughout the game.
---
Soon the adventures are just gonna be one wing for like $20 and people are still going to defend it
---
Our vigilance shall never end.
---
Were you the kid in class who put your hand up to answer a question just to say "I don't know"?
---
Pro players rope way to much.  His own damn fault.
---
Fenomen0-6.
---
Grizzly was changed due to confusion over whether or not it was a beast.
---
Zayle wasn't really a golden legendary, it was just a funky deck option, you can't craft it down
---
Yeah, so priest wins like slightly more (58%) of the time. That doesn't change the fact that I spend 20 minutes a game watching some jackass play 4 lackeys a turn while having to stare at card backs while they discover infinite value solutions. My issue isn't whether or not the deck can lose, it's the prevalence of it combined with how boring it is to play against.
---
Did you just give me an n word pass
---
Hi! I made it with EVA foam, contact glue, hot silicone and acrylic paint!
---
It had the beast tag though.
---
I agree but I cant help but thinking, its just an azure drake no one is gonna freak about it
---
I got the mage quest :(
---
Still hyped for the single player, and the more card backs the better
---
Itll be strong with about 2-4 mana but past that itll be steaming hot buns especially after 7
---
But other ghostly creatures in the past weren't beasts.  So they made it not ghostly.  To date the only exception left is Arfus.
