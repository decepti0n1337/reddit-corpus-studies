Mage only has two alts

and he/she is abrasive and likes petty name-calling. shocking.
---
Exactly! Especially in the murloc shaman meta.
---
I don't think it would keep poisonous when respawned
---
You dont, but sometimes you have double battlecries and ya get what ya get
---
I've tried it out and it's not that great. Gets run-over easily by Hunters and Zoo. Jade Druid is far superior because Druids have more healing, more taunts, more Jade activators, and more ways to draw those cards.
---
Yeah, Zilliax is an insane heal/tempo turn;
---

---
With say a 13-13 pogo (reasonable) A pogo/zilliax turn means:
---
-6 mana
---
-heal 16
---
-kill a huge minion(or any minion)
---
And of course, it leaves a 16-15 lifesteal on board.
---
That's a HUGE tempo play, you get like 20-25 mana worth of stuff at once.
---
Sure it only has that one heal, but it's such a big one... There aren't many classes that can heal/armor for more than 10-20 in a game.
---
Arch mage antonidis
---
&gt; It sounds ridiculous, but from a high level perspective, a player logging in for the first time in a year and queuing up against a flurry of portraits that they don't recognize could be off-putting.
---
What do you think is more off-putting: queuing up against a portrait you don't realize, then mousing over their hero power and realizing it's just a different skin for a hero you've played against multiple times...
---
Or playing against brand new sets of cards, which have brand new mechanics that are not always intuitively understandable, which release in the hundreds every 3 months?
---
If new players can deal with the latter, there is absolutely no reason to think they would struggle with the former. None.
---
I feel like Vargoth isn't worth it in this deck, you're only running 7 spells and Kangors + Vargoth is 11 mana
---
So smug and pompous 
---
*I love it*
---
No issues for me.
---
Loatheb and Zilliax.

r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
They're ugly as sin. Most of the card art doesn't have a color palette designed around having an extremely bright yellow border, and the human eye's perception of color changes drastically depending on which colors are surrounding it. Then they apply a bunch of swirlies and sparklies that cover the card art, some really tacky "flash animation" style rotations or warping, and often they'll vastly increase the contrast of the image to make it "cooler" or something. Not only do you not get the nice weathered class/neutral card background, but the art itself gets completely vandalized.
---
Filthy Android player patiently waiting with you
---
I mean they could have buffed rocket boots if they wanted to buff something in warrior, but those two are kind of the only other options since the everything else in boomsday already sees play for warrior.
---
What do you do if you didn't open a WotOG pack then? Buy it with real money?
---
Hes on the draw so he wont have it,
---
Barnes on 3 on the other hand.

---
Pretty sure Blizzard """testing""" is just some aggressively feminine gay dudes sipping white wine and taking notes about how they feel about each card as its played.
---
Soooo, why isn’t there another Hunter skin? I feel like there’s so many fun options for hunter, but it is still neglected

I wouldn’t say it’s good. But it’s fun. And some people like to have fun when they play. Adding 1 fun card isn’t a big deal but some people are bad at the game and need to take their frustrations out on someone to feel better about themselves. That’s what this person is doing to OP.

Also important to note that metas are different at different rankings. A number of niche deck builds that can beat tier 1 decks actually lose to tier 2-3 decks but just rely on never running into them at certain levels.
---
No way, Jade Druid is far superior. Jade only requires you to play 1 jade card to buff the jades. Pogo requires at least 2 + time to draw another Pogo. Rogue does not have many ways of surviving the early/mid game long enough to generate large Pogos without compromising that game plan. As a Rogue how are you suppose to beat an aggro Mech Hunter or Zoo opening and also start to play your Pogos + shuffle them + draw them.
---
I'm all for player friendly content and this bs alienation through pre-orders and shit like Nemsy / Khadgar are predatory. If they had the option to buy in store after a period it would alleviate some of this pressure. I agree they should keep exclusivity to season card backs. Then, add the ability to buy cardbacks and give the people who owned the previous version golden / tinted versions of them to show prestige.
---
And it’s shocking that you can’t own up to your own mistake and continue to make generalizations.

&gt;You're exactly right and I feel the same way, which is why I didn't call them greedy or anything in the comment

Oh okay sorry. Again: In both this subreddit and others, most people making comments like yours lack that self-awareness. It really sucks.
---
&gt;but it's the players' fault if anyone decides to complain.
---
I'm glad we're pretty much on the same page here. Though I do want to say, at least when it comes to arguing with people, it's imo worth conceding that a company DOES take some responsibility. Just not all of it.
---
&gt;If people eat up these low effort bundles and reskins, then by all means, take advantage
---
Well it's like the typical "unlocked door + burglar" example. The consumers are the ones who leave their door unlocked and in fact intentionally leave out more valuables for the burglar. But that doesn't make the burglar much more justified in doing what they're doing.
---
And yes I'm aware it's far from a perfect analogy but the point is, Blizz doesn't HAVE to take full advantage of people forking over money for anything.
---
You talk as though all buffs are of equal magnitude. Its possible to use large buffs on weak cards to make them very strong, as one can use small buffs on strong cards to make them very strong. There's no relationship between the original power level of the card, and the power level of the card after applying a buff.
---
This might make sense if you were talking about decks, or archetypes.
---
I am dumpster rank 5 so that makes sense
---
I am devastated. I only just got to 500 wins with Shaman, I wanted to take a screenshot of Morgl going gold... but then I realized I finished the game as Hagatha. Ruined. :(
---
This also seems to be a bug for me that EVERY encounter shows as Wendy, including the hero power so i have no idea what im fighting
---
Thank you for elaborating on what I wrote. Cheers!
---
sure, let me just finish my run full of 2 mana 2/2's with a downside
---
it's going to be a great experience, thanks blizz
---
They said they were planning on adding more lackeys in later sets so they probably just created an actual lackey "set" to dump them all in instead of manually coding each lackey generator. 
---
It's not a bad way to do it honestly, but completely forgetting you have a lackey set *literally during the expansion where you made the lackey set* is indefensible.
---
I play on an iMac and the game freezes immediately upon launch. Game won’t move past tavern doors. No error messages or anything either.
---
No
---
it's a sign from god to become a priest irl
---
OTK = one turn kill.
---
Example would be Exodia Mage, where in a single turn the player can slap down a bunch of Sorcerer's Apprentices and an Archmage Antonidus which gives them repeated 0 cost 6 dmg fireball that they can cast on you over and over until you're dead.
---
How did this happen? I’m rly curious
---
Then if you don't seal the win this turn, you carpet next turn lol and relaly drive the point home.
---
You are not alone. Just tried to open it and it says tap anywhere to update. I tap and it takes me to the store where it shows no update. I cannot play on android because it wont let me update.
---
Bomb warrior
---
Do you have a Mage or Hunter deck open?  It does show all the buffed cards too.
---
Well damn. Now I really wish they wouldn't have nerfed reckless expirimenter
---
Bad example sorry. Nemsy just punished people for other reasons. Anything that marginalizes based on exclusivity whether that be location / money / practicality etc. It's fine as long as they are reinstated later by other means. Permanent exclusivity should be minimal as it is predatory.
---
Really? No I don't. It's just the one card for me. A bug?
---
I cannot update on android for NA either. It shows no update in the play store.
---
With a high enough apm it would  have been a turn 5 otk for priest providing a mech sticks. Defenitely broken
---
Uninstall/reinstall imo.
---
Same thing happens to me on Samsung S10 right now, so it s not because of your phone being on iOS. On PC in the Blizzard client says that they are having some problems and are working on fixing them, I couldn t play on PC like 1 hour ago but now works, and on mobile it still doesn t. So be patient, it should work in a little while hopefully

&gt; Cool story bro

Look at all the nerfs rogue got 2 weeks ago, of course it's "bad". The decks arein the experimenting phase and far from refined, just give it time. But even with nerfed prep etc. rogue is very far from being bad.
---
So... did she absolutely slaughter you or was her hero power shit this late?
---
THINK OF ALL THAT CARD DRAW
---
😱 that doesn’t sound fun at all, at least not to be on the receiving end.
---
I can confirm from experience it trashes bomb warrior even harder, only way to win that matchup is basically to play dr boom turn 7 and blast master turn 8 with at least 3 bombs in their deck already. If you don’t have the perfect draw and opponent plays properly you’re just fucked.

"The update hasn't gone out yet for mobile"
---
Wtf?
---
Bruh, this isn't working on my phone. Is it not out on mobile yet?
---
It's my turn and it didn't draw any cards. Hence the dialogue coming from my character
---
If you want to play control. Go to standard game mode. Wild is for broken decks.
---
Wild R25 might also be Standard R25 Legend,
---
all in all your skill level is about to R25, perfect MMR.
---
I grew up in the (us) south -- it was a surprisingly effective tactic
---
Crystology, necromechanic and thunderhead are all going to be very good cards. I wouldn’t be surprised if thunderhead pushes shaman over
---
I know! She's the best! I felt so bad when, I forget which boss, but they call her evil and she has a "Me no evil..." voiceline that sounds so hurt agh poor Squeamlish!!

who cares about your issues lol? why bother comment

---
KuulGryphun#1403, NA, I show you go!
---
It's... Pretty much the same. Arena sets rotate every 2 months now, and that's about it. The ones active now are GvG, The Grand Tournament, Karazhan, Boomsday and Rise of Shadows.
---
&gt; People have been scrambling left and right saying these buffs break the game 
---
Not what people was referring to, but, yeah, i guess the patch technically *broke* the game.
---
What? I never said I had any issues.
---
Specially on middle rotation. I guess if we can dream about that, would be in a new rotation. Even that would be problematic, considering that there are no cards from the previous year, or they would have to introduce backyards, and probably giving for free to every player, or something on that line. What isn't good for numerous reasons.
---
They don’t do it because they have decided that heroes should be a very occasional and big reward. If they hand out 9 of them at a time they lose some of the value. It’s like if you had steak every day, you’d eventually get bored of it. They clearly want the heroes to be something important that people get excited about, which they’ve succeeded at
---
weren't the zandalari the ones who like literally made the thunder god?

I remember feeling this way about Miracle Rogue back in the day as well. Watching MrYagut's thought process of x deck was most played recently, y deck beats x, miracle rogue beats y, so lets play miracle rogue now." In my head, I thought, "If the deck requires this much effort and meta reading to function, is it the deck that's exceptional or you that's exceptional? I remember the pre-nerf Patron Warrior and pre-nerf Kazakus priest days. (Both were called 'high skill ceiling' decks too) Top players ran those decks even when 50+% of the meta was unfavorables.
---
You cant

Really.

I've still not received the patch.

Fuck this game man...

It would be unprecedented, but I don't think they'd have trouble coming up with the sufficient amount of cards that other classes have. I don't want to undermine the point that it would prove difficult, because I do think it would be challenging, but I also think it's doable.  One idea that I've had is give a different monk legendary to each class that act as deck warping/deck creation challenges. The idea would be to build a deck that is good on its own and also moves/plays well with your monk leggo if you so choose to include it in your decklist. A monk leggo that gives you a new hero power and gives you 4 cards from the monk card pool would be quite nice. I also enjoy the revolving door hero power of Dr. Boom, the monk archetype could be in favor of value town antics as well as lifesteal. It could bring a revival to control decklists.
---
I do like the deathknight style hero card idea - I think that's the one that's most balanced an feasible for them to pull off, they would just need to really get it right with the balancing.
---
It won't be that broken. It'll be incredibly strong but the lack of Divine Favor is showing its effect with people running just for the draw 2 effect. Some cards are allowed to be strong and this one is only a rare so it won't hurt anyone too much to get it. You'll see a lot of paladins running this until it rotates but I don't see it being the straw the breaks the meta.
---
&gt; try testing a major change like that
---
I do every day for work. You can’t make me do it here too!
---
Made a deck with the paladin recipe, then added Zayle, then added 2 more cards.

Hey guys, im playing in NA server mobile and can not find the update. I have restart my ipad and not find it yet. Does anybody face the same issues?
---
*me smash*
---
I would love if they used this for nerfs as well. I always disenchant as there is just zero downside and you can always craft them again anyway. Not sure if nerfed cards would be "featured" so to speak, but at least giving a temporary nerf tag for the search bar would be great.
---
magni is cool though.

What it looks like for me on Android rn
---
I have been playing on mobile without the update. Not sure how it's allowed though
---
It's not an issue. 15 months of playing with a specific set is enough.
---
Magic the Gathering experimented with rotating the equivalent of rotating one set out when a new expansion came out, and it was a unsuccessful, they reverted back to the same method as they'd previously used, (the same method as HS uses).
---
Kobolds and Catacombs was an overpowered expansion. They can do that when it's the last set of the year, because it won't be in Standard as long. Even after 15 months, I suspect the majority of players were happy to see it leave. 
---
Also, when they released Genn and Baku in the first expansion of the year, a lot of people were critical of it simply because it was the first expansion. They turned out to be so meta-defining that Blizzard rotated the cards a year early (the first time they'd ever Hall-of-Famed expansion cards). That was, overall, a popular decision.
---
People cry and moan about skins and stuff but buying Khadgar as part of the World Wildlife Fund charity drive was the best investment ever. By far my favorite skin and Blizzard hasn't rotated him back in even once.
---
I mean, if blizzard were to ever do class packs, selling them with a hero that you could only buy once would be the way to go.
---

I wouldnt worry about your cards going to wild since the standard meta isnt fun anyways
---
Wow indeed. I haven't realized an extension costs 20EUR...
---
That's 80e just to get back in the game... I will pass on this.
---
It allows for more variance throughout the year.  There's definite difference in the way that big vs small metas feel and having them vary is nice.  You can also disruptive synergies between set 6 and 1-3 as they'll only be part of Standard for 4 months.
---
&lt;insert joke about hungry crab and morgl&gt;

Has blizzard said anything about this? Like when or how or what happened that is taking so long?
---
The murlocs have the stats 16/16 when not restricted by the ice
---
Just had this happen to me
---
I don’t think either are required, but if I had to craft one I think Antonidas is the better value both in the deck and as a classic card.
---
Alright just wanted to thank you for the heads up.
---
The issue was for me on mobile iOS there has been no update. So nothing appeared, not even the legendary I’ve been waiting for since yesterday.
---
Just logged on to a PC and instantly the new legend popped up and I found this bundle.
---
If you’re appearing offline that can be the cause as well
---
I’m sorry I’m not completely up to date on every single aspect of this game that I know the status of the iOS updates down the the second. I’m used to weird shit happening with my devices and figured this was just another example.
---
Can someone fill me in on what turned out to be broken that prompted this post? I'm in the dark :(
---
&gt;They weren’t achieving those ranks because the cards were present, however; they achieved those ranks in spite of those cards being present.
---
Whether it's in games, sports (playing or watching others), the "It was the right thing to do: It worked!" thought/argument will never cease to exist. 
---
If you play and discuss poker with others you'll this on a daily basis; Player makes a huge mistake by raising all-in in a bad spot, wins the hand when everyone folds, and nothing you could say would make him realize the shove was a mistake, because it worked. Same thing if he overcalls on a draw, and hit it.
---
I think this might be even more present in a game like HS, because (sadly) too often the winner is decided not on good/bad plays, but simply on matchups, deck ordering and the like... Say you play a warrior mirror and you have boom on 7 while your opponent's boom is the 30th card, you can do a LOT of horrible mistakes, and still win the game easily. 
---
If you make a mistake at every single turn, you might realize you did poorly (and just got lucky about deck ordering) but if you only make one or two mistake, you will not realize it.
---
The same applies with card usages in decks. Especially if you don't pay attention to database stats, or don't analyze them properly. 
---
If you're a very good player, you could add a subpar card to your deck (say, using the 34th best card available, rather than the 30th, to complete the deck) and still win with a 65% winrate. It'll be extremely hard to convince that person that he's using a bad card, because he's winning so much.
---
And he'll remember the good things the card did more than the bad things it didn't do (where it would've been better to have the other card) because as he wins 65% of his game, there are way less times where he's in bad shape due to the card, than times where he just win regardless of the card.
---
That's a twist... very twisty.
---
I see, so I can just skip LUna

Yeah! I mean how dare they ban people who would take advantage of the next exploit they find without thinking twice!

&gt;8 buffed beasts in your deck and a full hand, more value than boom gives on average.
---
That is in no way more than dr boom. An average Dr boom, in the same time it takes for a zuljin setup, will provide way more value than Zuljin, higher quality cards (5 mana 6-6's ain't great, 5 mana 8-8's are better but require luck and are still worse than dynomatic, devastator, zilliax, mechathun, mech whelp, bulldozer and boom reaver), and give everything rush.
---
They just aren't comparable. The only thing zuljin has on boom is that you aren't relying on drawing him in a timely fashion.

Anyway, report his ass; There's 99.9999999999999% chance he won't do a thing, but regardless, he has to learn not to do shit like that.
---
They usually do, but I haven't played on my phone for a while, cuz I had my PC at hand. It slipped my mind to update it on my phone as well.
---
But even then, a patch should not be causing issues with logging in, no matter how late someone is.

No idea about HS but WoW accounts got banned for less.
---
I think there are some cool animated ones like Humility. Though, yeah, mostly all tacky swirls and shit.
---
So.. What happened then?
---
Took me over 1 year of daily play to get 2 preps, remember quite well bc I didn’t want to craft Edwin before I had those
---
This was also the case for ETC and Gelbin Mekkatorque, linked to attending Blizzcon in 2014 and buying packs during beta.
---
Just looked into this, why in the hell is RealID even a thing? What was Blizzard thinking implementing that shit? 
---
It seems to be enabled by default too, because it was enabled on my account and no way in hell I'd ever enable that garbage. 
---
So warning to everyone, if you don't want people to know your name, go disable that!
---
It's a visual issue; they hope to push out a fix later this week: https://twitter.com/PlayHearthstone/status/1135595769883324416
---
This should really be stickied.
---
Well it's a suggestion IF they feel they need to nerf it, that does not impact other viable decks. But I'm also wondering if you're right with "If you have to add exceptions it means your design is wrong". Blizzard does not design around wild cards. So exceptions can be an intelligent way of combining new (not designed around) ideas with the old cards.
---
For example: The nerf of Dread Steed could have been averted if Blizzard just added the text "(Immune to Defile). Is this elegent? No. Is it effective in keeping a card as functional as possible in a format in which new cards are added without regard of old interactions? Yes!
---
You beat me to it.
---
And it's more fun than playing vs the same deck every single time, god dammit
---
How about it not reducing cost by more than 2?
---
That's a bit of a wishful thinking... I hope Blizzard will instead give some sort of compensation for the many bugs we've seen from the new patch. Can't play HS for 24hrs on mobile, arena bugs, can't play in play mode, a billion crashes before getting past starting screen, just to name a few. I think blizzard should revert the account status for those who profited from the free pack glitch and then give everyone an extra arena ticket as compensation for all the trouble
---
*looks at list*
---
That's an expensive deck good gosh
---
You forgot Exodia Priest. The velen smite test subject combo has an infinite version and easily makes more damage than Exodia Mage before roping out.
---
Grand betrayal we were epically trolled by Bob the whole time ...
---
They explicitly said that they care for that interaction in wild. So if they care, I want them to care the way I feel would be best
---
Jazzark#2741 (eu)
---
If you start making an exception players will want more exceptions. How long until we have: "5 mana: deal 5 damage to a minion, if it's mech deal 3 instead, if it has divine shield freeze it, if it's mana cost wasn't paid fully deal 10 damage instead. This can't target Mountain Giant. This card can't target lifesteal minions."
---
Full res and mock hero card here: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Bmeeq6

The inn keep finally had enough of your shit. All the minions you roughed up and threw out. All the stolen goons, all the table cheating. Its his time for payabck
---
Boni is the german plural for bonus as far as I know.
---
I recomend nobbel87 on YouTube and chronicles (basicly wow lore bible)

That'll bring pandamonium

Ah yes of course, why wouldn't you casually slip say, 中文 into a sentence otherwise  written in English.
---
Nemzy?
---
Have you ever played Jade? Honest question?
---
Cause the only similarity between both things is that they create minions that grow bigger over time. But that's about it. And that alone wasn't what Jade made so brutal to play against.
---
I'm just throwing in "Ultimate Infestation"
---
AK47 Druid and naga giants
---
“This OTK will blow your mind, just need to draw a card, wait 15+ turns, and for your opponent to play two of a card not in any meta deck”
---
Your suggested nerf to Dread Steed has a hole in it (Lord Crowley) which means they would need 2 exceptions today, and need to keep adding more and more exceptions as time goes own.  
---
That makes it harder for them to design the game and a lot more confusing.
---
Not as consistent after the nerfs as before
---
Exodia didnt do dmg in yugioh either. Exodia doesnt always mean infinite dmg, it means "i win whatever your health". Mechathun is an exodia type of deck, for example.
---
That would require a wonky card text
---
Thanks for the insight. I haven't seen Mechathun decks since quite some time now, they seem to have all been completely converted to Nomi and Archivist Elysana. What's the reason for that, are those more versatile or easier to set up? I have a Mechathun myself which I haven't ever while playing on the ladder.
---
Looks badass!
---
Cool story bro
---
Kung fu panda got a lot sicker
---
I feel personally attacked reading this thread
---
Blizzard just posted that the update will be available within 10 hours
---
I think it's pretty delusional that you think nobody reads the post before downvoting. I think most people just think the post is bad, and doesn't make any
---
Huh. Today I learn.
---
Haters gonna hate
---
odd rogue isn't much better buddy
---
Its happens to me on google play, i don't really know why.
---
Keep scheme in your opening hand
---
Sapped a turn before probably. Buffed cards removed from the board (sap, psychic scream) return to their original state.
---
Honestly I’m not mad that the update is taking so long, obviously this update really fucked with a lot of stuff in the game, so take the time you need Blizzard. My issue is that there has been no communication from Blizzard on any of their social media accounts in the matter, so from that perspective it just really seems disrespectful to mobile users, “we made sure PC came out on time, but mobile can suck a chub.”
---
Mi Mukla died to a poisonous Minion once, i'm still salty
---
Freezing trap / vanish / sap?  Buff cant just disappear by itself.
---
ViciousSyndicate. 
---
But this is clearly just confirmation bias. Hunter's the most popular class, but not by that much.
---
More simply to indicate I'm not serious about thrm trying to sell Saudi Arabia anything. Sensitive times my dude.
---
So ... you begin the game with nice overdraws? xd
---
I’ve never heard your Midrange definition but it makes sense to me and sort of explains why I’m drawn to Midrange decks. I *hate* having the exact same game plan every game and get bored with pure aggro or Control decks quickly.
---
I dunno about the Hearthstone flavor thing. Some cards are drawn really seriously

I'm surprised people have never heard of the RealID debacle. Then again, it was 9 years ago. It was way worse back then. Let me tell you about it.
---
In 2010, Blizzard introduced the concept of RealID. Rather than being an option, it was mandatory. And their plans included having to post on the forums under your real name. Yes, they were that deranged. There was a massive uproar against it. The doxing potential, obviously. But if you think about it, it also encouraged and rewarded people who registered under a fake name. I'm glad my 12 yo self (at the time of registering) was more internet savvy than 99% of today's internet population and registered under a fake name. Remember, these were people with years of WoW progress in their accounts, and you needed a subscription to post on the WoW forums, so they couldn't just make a new account just for forum posting. 
---
Anyway, WoW CM and former GM Bashiok wanted to prove that RealID is not a big deal, and posted his real name. Within hours, people found his FB account, his address, phone number, the names and addresses of relatives and so on. You'd think a CM of all people would know the depths of the internet. He ended up having to delete his FB account and changing his phone number. No idea what he did about the endless pizza orders.
---
As a result, Blizzard cancelled the plans to force the RealID on the forums, but it was still the only name on your B.Net account. If you didn't want to reveal your real name, you couldn't use the Battle.net friends list. It was still bad, I had to cringe every time I opened Battle net and saw the shitty fake name my 12yo ass came up with. But it was worse for others because people kept doxing themselves accidentally by posting screenshots of their desktop with Battle.net open in the background.
---
Handles, as we have them today, came years later.
---
Same on IOS, it seems they still haven’t updated the mobile platforms.
---
Ok. That’s it. It be time to RUMBLE
---
[metastats.net](http://metastats.net/)
---
Scroll down near the bottom of the page, 'Daily Class Frequency'.
---
Aaaand my entire life has been a lie.
---
You can just hear the roundabout leitmotif in this image.
---
I hope Chen becomes a Hero skin one day, hopefully when we get a Monk themed expansion eventually similar to Frozen Throne with Death Knights.
---
Agreed, but I don’t believe this was an issue with the app approval. App approval should only take a few hours max. This was something else entirely, not that this excuses taking almost an entire day to update mobile after PC.
---
That's only dangerous if you live in the USA.
---
A little odd that's a different tab when we have so many keywords on search already...  
---
  
---
Searching for 'featured', 'buffed', 'nerfed' would be more pratical IMO
---
I get you but I've played hearthstone enough to feel that this seems too strong
---
Is he up to no good?
---
Updates and stuff don't always go as planned. I believe the mobile normally always happened a bit later. Oh and it was a free update, plus its 1 day. If ppl can't not play a game on their mobile devices without throwing a fit there is an issue.
---
...MULTI-ARM JUTSU!
---
Other way around.
---
Big priest...............................................................
---
Yeah it basically shows up as Asset Downloads in your Settings icon, you'll see it when it's updating
---
No amount of Hearthstone can confirm that in single game.
---
Well, that's what the word means, so, yeah.
---
Don’t worry you’ll get 3 RotS packs.
---
It used to be enabled In the forums. One of the moderators was doxxed in minutes and they rethought that idea.
---
Flowchart: Are there cards you must draw to win?  
---
Me: Yes, there are cards I must draw in order to win.  
---
Flowchart: Will you lose if you don't draw them?  
---
Me: What did I just say?
---
you think its decent?
---
I think the problem is that they didn't even say there was a problem until a few hours ago. 
---
"Hi, mobile players! Looks like Dr Book was being wacky and pulled the wrong lever during your update process! Please sit tight for now as the update might not be deployed right on schedule."
---
Something like that would've worked. Nope. Silence all day.
---
disgusting
---
He can only play 2 a turn, tho
---
Why is it easier? You don't have access to the buffs and your enemies don't have it as well.
---
A monk expansion sounds awesome! Admittedly I stopped playing WoW right before monks were added, but I’ve always loved the art of Mists of Pandaria.
---
Uhh I think you're in the wrong thread dude
---
Why after the update all the decks that I have have missing cards? Am I missing something?
---
Thats a 1000th post about it since the adventure came out. It happens. Nothing special.
---
Stewie, where are we? (c) Brian Griffin
---
Me too!
---
FYI, the Hearthstone server keeps record of the most recent version of Hearthstone you've played and will only allow clients to log in if you are using that version or a more recent version.
---
Usually this is fine because different devices will all be on the same version. It only becomes an issue on new patch day.
---
If you log into your Hearthstone account only on your iOS or Android device, you will be on the prepatch version.
---
If you log into your Hearthstone account on an updated PC version, you will be locked out of your  iOS and Android versions until the update is rolled out for those devices.
---
So on new patch day, if you want to experience the new patch, you will be locked out of access to Hearthstone on your mobile devices. If you would rather play Hearthstone on mobile devices than experience the update, then you should avoid updating Hearthstone on your PC.
---
Also, the server prevents players with different versions matchmaking. That is why there's so many failed friendly match attempts on every new patch day.
---
The update will be rolling out in a few hours, provided the App Store gets back up and running.
---
no, but it seams like only good decks in wild are some SN1P-SN4P OTK combos and its so annoying
---
Tfw people think this otk is strong even though its stopped by 1 taunt or clearing all mechs
---
not as consistent? more like nearly impossible.
---
#where the Taurens at Blizz!?!?!?!
---
Thanks this is my first time getting this so i just wasn't sure what it was.
---
That's valid. Can i ask why not?
---
I've enjoyed it quite a bit because it's an incredibly accessible way to watch the best players go head to head. Lengthy weekend streams on the weekend; really easy to just drop in and watch a few hands or just leave it on in the background all day.
---
Please tell me you are joking
---
Just want to remind people that this isn't broken by wild standards. This combo has to compete in a game mode where aggro decks can kill you on turn 4-5. Archetypes such as Big Priest and Quest Mage can generate near infinate value and shut other decks down much earlier than turn 9. Classes like Even Warlock or Aggro pally drop 8/8s on turn 4-5 with an average draw.
---
I'm not saying this card isn't good, it's great. It's just the combo isn't all that insane in wild.
---
So does Madame Goya (2 mana 3/2 "When an Exortion is played, gain +1/+1", maybe even +2/+2). I wonder though, does Banker trigger when you play the coin and does Goya's minion trigger if she somehow gets the Exortion? A few of those special cards have been spaghetti coded to always defy "the opponent" as the player / the boss, regardless of who plays the card (Infinite Toki's 10 mana spell that restarts the game and keeps "your opponent" HP the same).
---
How I hate bring mostly mobile user :(
---
Indie company. What a joke, where does the money go?
---
Almost all cards are different, some lists only share 2 cards.
---
The only thing they have in common are that they are aggro midrange decks and the hero power.
---
glad you enjoyed, rip last arc
---
Also rip dead plot points because read the manga, but oh well, very enjoyable what was there, ily
---
At least I know I'll be getting work done today
---
Well the Banker does trigger when I play one, haven't played against Goya yet so idk about those exortions
---
Thank you! I'm a new player and I read somewhere that you don't get this on mobile
---
I might just be salty for getting blown out by mech hunters on turn 2 multiple times, but I fucking hate Mech Warper. It should absolutely by nerfed to "Cant reduce costs below (1)"
---
I'd rather have my head chopped off in a liveleak video for joking about selling arms to Saudi Arabia than use /s on reddit
---
I think i played their first online game ehen it was released.
---
also how is that shilling? 
---
I like them to change their buisness practice and make more patches. I don't say: "don't criticise them because poor blizzard" i say :"don't overdo it or they will try to avoid making too many patches."
---
It probably would be and I just misheard it.
---
In true blizzard fashion.
---
Blizzard isn't known for pandaring to the people who want free stuff.
---
It still is a thing. Boomship, MechaThun, Malygos, Whirlwind, Inner Rage x2.
---
I think this is a post which makes an amazing number of good points, and for the average player, it should probably be good, sobering advice. But I do think that there is a logical fallacy typical to academia which doesn't always result in the best real world results. 
---
Namely, being unable to prove that something is true does not mean that it is not true. I work in investments and this is simply a huge issue. Because academics have been unable to show that skill in active investment management exists, it is believed amongst many professionals that skill does not exist. For the average joe, I do believe an index fund is a better alternative than attempting to make your own choices. For even a professional I believe it's devilishly difficult to pick a skilled manager. However, I believe skilled managers exist. 
---
I think in the end your argument boils down to two things: (1) It can't be proven, and (2) If it's so difficult, most of you shouldn't be trying it anyway. I agree with both of those statements. But I do not agree that skill cap is a myth, or that the results of professionals are "in spite" of their poor card choices. (In Rogue, maybe I do. I think the GM league has had some Rogue lists which were absolute garbage). However, decks like Cyclone Mage, APM Boar Priest, Nomi Priest, etc. all demonstrate fairly conclusively (if not statistically) that a skilled player can do better than one who doesn't understand nuance. 
---
I do get that your argument is that the players skill doesn't mean the cards are the best - Toast took basic-only-hunter to legend, that doesn't mean that hunter players should run only basic cards. However, I feel there are decks, even if they tend to be more of the combo variety, where it is very obvious even in a small sample size that the skill of the pilot is more important than the card choices. We are literally arguing about the value of Banana Buffoon in mage, for example. It's not about the card, it's about the player.
---
Druid has Almost completely lost its identity already since the mana ramp cards are nerfed and nobody plays them. Giving a neutral choose ones would make him even more basic i assume.
---
ResidentSleeper
---
Wait. Pc and mobile play on different servers? I could have sworn i was playing vs pc players because the speed they que the minion attacks.
---
Or am i just getting confused here?
---
Im mobile player, been playing for 6 months
---
Back before Burning Crusade, Shamans were Horde only and Paladins were alliance only. Also both can take the roles of Healer, Damage Dealer and Tank (although Shaman's tanking potential was quickly phased out over expansions) so in many ways, Shamans and Paladins are close counterparts
---
Wait, so mechwarper + summoning portal works, but not mechwarper + reckless experimenter?
---
In that case I'd be less inclined for a nerf and more for an interaction fix.
---
Play Priest. Lots of warriors will concede as soon as they See your Heros Portrait.
---
If this were a couple months from now, I might have been inclined to agree with you, but with the card only being a day old and everyone rushing to play with the card while it's fresh, stuff will calm down and counterplays will be figured out.
---
Posts like this never work, change my mind.
---
No. Blizz did not send you packs or gold. you took advantage of an exploit to gain an advantage in game.
---
You still took stuff that is not yours. IMO the better equivalent is you walk down the street and find a wallet on the ground with 300$ in it. you did not need to break into anyones house, you did not need to take it out of someones hand, but if you take the wallet that is still theft.
---
"Ah, you've made a new enemy!"
---
It sucks because I updated yesterday on pc and haven’t been able to play on mobile because of it.
---
***ITS HAMMER TIME***
---
Yeah that definitely seems like a bug, you should still be able to play the Ratcatcher there.
---
That's... not right.
---
Elemrgll Mage, Battlecry Hand Mage, Shufflelock, Elemental / Control Shaman.. not exactly off meta but I don't see many other lists running Menacing Nimbus and Mountain Giants.
---
I hope this isn’t the new trend
---
Either approved user or added them over their email.
---
I am playing on my phone RN with no issues, I play 90% on mobile and haven't updated my PC yet. But it is working fine for me as of now.
---
I think blizz's development theory should be adjusted to having the expansions introduce archtypes, and the classic sets should support them, as opposed to cards like edwin and leeroy being the building blocks of most rogue decks for example. However, you also have to take in that if we start printing cards in new expansions that sufficiently replaces cards like leeroy, wild is gonna be overrun by random power spikes. Although i guess we could ignore balancing wild, or maybe do what they did with molten giant and buff it as it moves to wild.
---
that one stung a little
---
- Wow, I haven't seen Destiny in years. Last I've heard of him was in the Starcraft 2 scene, and that's been years now. Destiny and others in his "group" were interviewed by ChanMan(yes the same infamous chanman who was running multiple reddit accounts for the purposes of boosting his main account, and moaned/groaned about getting banned for it, downplaying them as merely "alt accounts"). That said, it was that Chanman seemed to typically shine a light on the more downtrodden/less popular players - you would never see the "popular guys", eg. Artosis, Tasteless, InControl and others on his stream.
---
- But despise this, I presume that Reynad's game "The Bazaar" is nicely along in development? And that he just couldn't get investor funding due to the troubles with Artifact, but well that didn't set him back at any rate?
---
If we look back at the timings and sequence of events, Artifact launch and The Bazaar announcement occurred in not too long a space apart from each other? Artifact didn't "die" immediately - it took at least a few weeks for the numbers to peak on the Steam Marketplace, and then another few weeks to a month or more for the numbers to sharply decline, no?
---
So for these investors to totally just refuse, say no, etc...it would have had to have occurred after the press savaged Artifact for its numbers and decline. That would have happened *after* Reynad's Youtube videos on The Bazaar, both promoting and showing us gameplay footage.
---
Flesh means a lot of things
---
I hope it is
---
Yeah, it also becomes extra hard when daylight savings involved
---
You might be a little lost but I was going off of only playing WoW in vanilla and was fine following.  She relates the story to characters in Hearthstone and if you don't know the character she will usually give you background.  Her presentation and voice are very calming so even if you can't comprehend 100% of the story it was still very enjoyable for me.
---
You make it sound like he became the Lich King because his horse died.
---
Thanks :)
---
Amazon coins "cash back" like deal. Amazon coins basically give you a discount when buying in app stuff, example, right now you can buy $100 in Amazon coins for $81 + you get 20% of what you spend on Hearthstone back as Amazon coins.
---
So i started to watch it and i got 12 minutes in before i stopped, not because i found it bad but because i found it so awesome i might wait for the remaster and play it first hand!
---
Not sure.
---
IT'S HAMMER TIME!
---
It's like it doesn't register that I recover all of my mana crystals
---
i have a feeling this will catch on as a format
---
Tbf, it is also a result of the availability of guns in the US. If the SWAT team thinks that it is a real threat, they also have to assume the person has weapons. I do not defend that end result, it is just a sad fact that they have to assume the person has a weapon and is ready to kill.
---
9 hours past this and still no fucking update on mobile Americas. I AM so glad that I didnt put a single penny on this game since WW and wont put for a long time, because of this bullshit.

I started a dalaran heist match but got disconnected before it started, then I downloaded the update, now it keeps trying to reconnect to that game and sending me to the reconnect screen on loop. so yeah im having a blast

Its June 4th,  when is this coming to mobile?
---
If you dont try that wont work
---
Wrong subreddit and no.

Those are Wild only cards, and if you're playing between ranks fifty and twenty-six, Wild only cards would be blocked off from you.
---
Is this the new "anal (ability)" spam from trade chat? Who knows...
---
&gt;Well, Nomi can be done 3x for one. Also, the crap ton of spells you can do let’s you throw out grave horrors very early to survive / even occasionally win as a mountain giant, and seance grave horror low mana drop can be a lot of pressure.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;It’s worth noting that it isn’t a popular deck, it’s just the most popular priest deck - priest representation is abysmal (check the vicious syndicate report, found on competitive HS or google it, tracks data supplied by deck trackers and gives analyses).  
---
&gt;Chef nomi is, according to them, an incredibly difficult to play deck with a large variance in win rate between high skill players and most folk. It’s like a Rubik’s cube, compared often to patron warrior. I don’t play it because chef nomi as a win condition doesn’t interest me...it’s not fun. Draw through entire deck and then do what’s basically dragoncaller Alanna, but you can do it three times.  
---
&gt;I’ve been experimenting with 2 deck types - 1 that used lots of removal and taunts and uses mind blast, alexstraza and squashling / auchenai for 30+ damage not including Alex. That’s worked decently well but should be better now with extra arms. I’ve also been trying out mech priest and want to experiment with it now with reckless, mechanical whelp, extra arms and snip snip. So far, it seems like just a crappier version of mech warrior (less removal, no dr boom, no omega devastates, way less armor and survivability), and a worse version of mech hunter (lower damage, slower, less “good” ways to tutor mechs, no venomizer/missile dude)  
---
&gt;It’s a struggle

That’s worked decently well but should be better now with extra arms. I’ve also been trying out mech priest and want to experiment with it now with reckless, mechanical whelp, extra arms and snip snip. So far, it seems like just a crappier version of mech warrior (less removal, no dr boom, no omega devastates, way less armor and survivability), and a worse version of mech hunter (lower damage, slower, less “good” ways to tutor mechs, no venomizer/missile dude)
---
It’s a struggle
---
I havent see this but if you want...
---
neq#2775 EU quest trade. I show, you go first
---
Not that i know of:)
---
Great find, i will add that with credit of course:)
---
Its because players like Zalae insist on playing mage Which objectively sucks
---
Removing twinspell from it is less retarded than your idea.
---
Actually, it looks like you don't
---
Issues here as well. Heroic mode is showing i completed every chapter with every class (I haven't). Normal mode seems fine for me though.
---
Fuck you're dumb. How do you know he's saying it's not worth it if you're not watching the video?
---
This is something I've wanted for such a long time. Patron Warrior could exist if Warsong Commander just said "does not give charge to Frothing Berserker". Dreadsteed Warlock could work if Defile said "a minion except Dreadsteed".
---
Thank u
---
I didn't see anything about Reckless Experimenter being nerfed and giving full dust value, I just stumbled across it in the patch notes... Don't see it mentioned in the blog post, and also didn't see the card highlighted in the "The following cards have changed" popup UI upon login.
---
So, if you have Reckless Experimenter(s) in your inventory and want full dust value, take a look! Be sure to double check that you're getting full value before clicking though, I don't want blamed if it goes wrong! lol
---
Look at magic, after years, they still have a ton of modes to play. I'm sure that once Wild becomes completely stale, there will be changes to the format. There could be more formats to come think of something like a rotating commander mode.
---
Minor irritation: you can't switch regions/accounts during asset downloads. You have to exit the Hearthstone app.

That's no good

I honestly have no idea what everyone got so riled up about, I wasn't even being offensive. It's common for people to have 2 and more monitors around here, monitors are not really an expensive piece of hardware, so what the fuck is ya'll's problem with me? Lmao.

You want r/circlejerk

It needs to be experimenter+mechwarper.
---
That’s the order I played them in, yes, and it still didn’t work.
---
What if I changed the card text to read 'Start of Game: Remove Twinspell from all copies of Conjurer's Calling'?
---
Same here. Glad to know it’s not just me.
---
What is that bug you are taking about?
---
I haven't heard anything
---
Or u can just pick cloak of invis and completely and utterly destroy every possible encounter on heroic simply coz that treasure is straight up broken
---
&gt;That mistake would forever be branded on the card if its written out
---
Again, it wouldn't be a mistake then but an intentional design. That's like saying Pit Lord's negative battlecry has forever branded the design mistake of making Pit Lord so overstatted.
---
&gt; That one-tenth of one percent of cards will end up making up a large chunk of cards that can actually see play 
---
How so? If the competitive decks they are in are nerfed via exceptions to interactions, won't they as the result see less play?
---
&gt; and that list of rules text exemptions you mention later would progressively become novel length as time goes on 
---
First, that's a slippery slope fallacy and if we use the currently existing cards as a sample size, it'd be very unlikely for a single card to have even two exceptions to it - especially if the exceptions were written as card text and thus only one combo piece had to state it. Second, obviously cards could still be changed by more conventional means when the actual mechanic seems overpowered, which it would be a sign of if a single card had to have multiple exceptions.
---
"does not give charge to Frothing Berserker, or a mech magnetised by several copies of a zero cost mech, or a minion buffed by a spell that cost zero, or a...."
---
Trust me, this way lies hell.
---
Oh, she'll be eating flesh alright
---
ive been using, mech hunter the most. I go up to 16 then back down again. This has been my fav deck so far. I just started conj mage but i dont have all the cards, missing doomsayer and sandbinder
---
W H Y
---
That's because Rogue secrets are wild now.
---
Despite discover being a class mechanic, Secret Plan when played by a rogue can still give hunter secrets. 
---
It was explosive trap by the way.
---
I was going to say that that would kill some fun with unstable evolution but then I remembered that it isn't even an echo card
---
I was able to win with bomb-hero power warrior pretty handedly. The trick is to draft board clears/removal/health over other bomb cards. Your hero power is 6 damage per cast as long as you can stall long enough for the boss to draw your bombs. Somewhat counter-intuitively, bomb cards have anti-synergy that strategy. They're low tempo, and doing something your hero power is already accomplishing on it's own. Pick up every brawl, king mosh, and board clear treasure you can. Double health is also great here.

Still up
---
actually same ahaha
---
It’s pretty disorienting to come back to the app without it crashing;)
---
Fairness is a f2p exploitravaganza where cards are distributed through gambling and your opponents are random... No, not a thing. 
---
For real, why does it bother you somebody got something you didn't? Yes, obviously it was not intended by Blizzard and from their perspective allowing it to stand would cut into theoretical profits to be made. For you however, it doesn't matter what the fuck cards anyone else gets or doesn't get. 
---
So, someone who took advantage of the exploit yesterday is better off because they circumvented some of the bullshit gambling built in to the game. You and I did not. If we (we don't have a choice but if we did) allowed them to keep the cards, the net result is more people would be better off at no expense to ourselves. If we take away those cards, people are worse off and there's a net negative.
---
Did you previously play on battlenet after the update?
---
Do you think secret plan would give rogue secrets in wild?
---
Damn r/hearthstonecirclejerk just can't keep up
---
Yeahnah#11866 NA trading 80g quest you go first
---
I actually had someone challenge me from a PC to my mobile client.  Haven't tried duplicating that yet.
---
Is maiev a dude ??
---
Yes, there would be no reason to give you dust for making your cards better.
---
I just logged in and saw the same change! This has to be a bug. Pisses me off that I actually took the effort to complete different wings with the same heroes for nothing. I think I actually lost a crown for one of the heroes I completed. Can someone from the hearthstone team give us some more info on it?
---
It would.
---
Just run your mouse over every card in your deck and it should be fixed. Nothing to worry about
---
When *any* comic, cartoon, or game character is introduced, there is pr0n of them online within hours.  It's rule 34, subsection a.
---
How about they just don't print cards that need retarded artificial limitations to not be broken?
---
Negative.
---
Yup. If Paladin/Mage plays Secret Plan, they discover Paladin/Mage secrets. If a class without secrets plays Secret Plan (i. e. Warlock), they would discover Hunter secrets by default.
---
As someone who has been grinding for years and is very lucky to occasionally gets invited to some of these things, I'll provide my thoughts, for what little they're worth. I don't mind being passed over for non-Hearthstone creators folks if they're going to be promoting Hearthstone to a wider audience with their presence. If they bring their audience into the game, that's ultimately good for Hearthstone and by proxy good for me.
---
I will admit, at first glance, I'm not sure there was a lot of "outside audience promotion" achieved with this one (and perhaps by no fault of the creators themselves). For instance, one invitee re-streamed the event to ~300 people, which is pretty disappointing for someone with 1 Million+ reach, AND it was in the wrong game category on Twitch. There may yet be some long-term value from YouTube videos and social promotion and just getting them into the ecosystem, so I'm still hopeful. And again, I'm not blaming said creator here, there may have been some crossed wires, miscommunications, etc., but that does sadly feel like a bit of a lost opportunity.
---
ALL that said, at the end of the day, the fact that the Hearthstone team is doing more, even with missteps along the way, is a good sign. They'll start to figure out what works and what doesn't, and it'll be good for the game to get more support in the long run, whether I'm personally involved or not.
---
What I want from Blizzard for heroes: obtainable male and female characters for each class. I want to be able to choose to play a male Rogue or female Warrior.
---
It is super duper broken right now. I have 3 classes left for phase 3 heroic, so I am sure I've not touched phase 4 in heroic but every class both says "new" and complete with the checkbox... hopefully they fix it soon for all of us completion addicts :)
---
Deke#1346 NA have the spectate quest, need someone to stare at :|
---
Heck yeah let's go!  By the books :p
---
Android here, the HS app sends me to the store to fetch the update, but it shows as up-to-date at the store. (And of course it won't let me play without updating.)
---
Don’t really have comments on your idea but I do think they are going to dilute the pool of 12 cost minions with some sort of situational minion with a strong battlecry but otherwise poor stats or weird end of turn effect
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Lilian_Voss
---
Problem solved! 
---
They have so many WoW characters to choose from, many of which already are/would be perfect alternate heroes. Legion had class order halls where you could travel with [various NPCs of the same class as you ](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/class-order-halls-champions) from the lore.
---
Still no update available for Android (at least for me)
---
Mech deathrattle Hunter and Aggro shaman are both fun. Both decks just got better with the new rise of mechs buffs.
---
its okay, I just completed it!
---
Thanks for taking time to reply :)
---
Same as above... Just informing that this situation remains as of this post
---
I'm quite triggered by the fact that the stupidly slow animations nearly made you miss lethal.
---
You may want to note re: Sonya Shadowdancer. Some bosses just ignore her on board for whatever reason. I'm not sure if her statline is too minor and the AI would rather go face or go for bigger minions, but I was surprised to have it happen in a couple of runs.
---
Coupled with the Rocket Backpacks (Rush), you can get some insane value.
---
Have they possibly dc'ed? There are times when I think my opponent is taking forever on mobile, and until I've quit and restart the game, I learn I've just lost, missing a turn or two.. and it looks like I'm the asshole not doing anything..
---
Solely a visual bug
---
yeah, all that thinking for nothing :D
---
I am a f2p living in a p2w world, so unfortunately I do need to earn money.
---
Garrosh! You are not fit to rule the Horde.
---
At times like this I would have preferred no event to just getting a golden card that I can't even disenchant.
---
One could make an argument for odd/even decks, though that wouldn't really apply to any of the current changes.
---
The Great Akazamzarak played Mirror Image against me.
---
Looks like I’ll be going for fun, because I can’t stand hunter 😂 thanks for the advice mate
---
Do you have the latest version of iOS? Check your settings.
---
Same here. 6:42 eastern where I am :/
---
Too specific, and kinda unfun for when you discover  extra mechs. Just blanket "Echo cards can't cost less than 1" now so we don't have to ask "how does this work with echo" for every future card.
---
I was honestly surprised to see yet another Shaman hero, pleasantly surprised tho since one of my favorite decks right now is Big Shaman.
---
The emotes are well voice acted but I think I'm gonna stick with Rastakhan, he's more fun for me.
---
East Coast?
---
Swearing? On *my* christian Minecraft server?
---
The combination of large aggro radius, close grouping, and tendency to be surrounded by water to slow you down made them a monster, particularly for human characters, who by coincidence had ALOT of them spawn on islands during their leveling process.
---
I believe it only works on your opponents turn if they force the minion to attack. This may get down voted if not true :(
---
Same here. I figured it's more a data display quirk rather than "the update randomly removed cards from decks."
---
Priest is not weak atm. Druid though....thats ridiculously OP and simple.
---
This was announced ahead of time.
---
That Woman only invitational was also pretty good
---
Am I being wooshed? It's a legendary it has to be a one-of.
