In deck against a plague Lord, made a 31/2 book due to the sword treasure. but In hand? That's is some impressive dedication to knowledge haha
---
You already were legend before you started that game. I think it broke.
---
Who won? Your Opponent or You(r Opponent)?
---
Prob vip then?
---
Yes there is but every time I encounter it, it has 1 secret and 2 secret-based minions. I've only ever been able to activate Jr. Tomb Diver's battlecry once.
---
Reminds me of trumps deck where his wincon was just killing off his tinyfins.
---
your opponent won.
---
Mecha'Thuned the fucker. Very satisfying. Blew up the board with a twisting nether off a random zephrus from astral riff. (Had that sweet "play an odd card to reduce cost of cards by 1).
---
Nice
---
As already commented, you escape, go to the tavern and come back to the fight. The plague lord won't regenerate its health, so it's quite a good choice. I picked it on the second lord in normal, used it when I saw I'm about to die, and beat the lord in two times without having to repeat the whole run.
---
I'd imagine that if you casted this on a minion that was both a Dragon and a Mech (for example) that half of your offered minions would be that minion and the other half the actual Amalgam.
---
An'a
---
Restart the client, the fastest way :) It does this because the lords are coded to check their health every time they take damage. Understandable, but still not too clever of a way :)
---
I had 2 of them in a deck earlier and it didn't cast itself
---
Team 5 currently seems to have issues with Combo decks is when it is prevalent and when it can reasonable combat aggressive strategies.
---

---
YOUR MINIONS THINK YOU ARE WEAK
---
They just don't want to discuss with players. What they think is absolute.
---
But the fact is that the combine intellectual and knowledge of the community is greater than their whole team. I bet we have engineers, doctors, lawyers, a long list of professional, etc
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
BTW, I still think their turn resolution and death status resolution code is far away from ideal.
---
I just had something similar happen. Got him down to 60ish hp, used hearthstone, came back he was back up .. got him down to 80 something and when I got back to the start screen he's back to full..
---
As a quest shaman, you‚Äôre at a disadvantage against quest priest because the time you lose setting up only benefits him. Once he‚Äôs got his own quest up, it‚Äôs going to be extremely difficult for you to get through to him. I had a little bit of success in simply playing passively during my setup and denying him opportunities to heal damage. Unfortunately this isn‚Äôt much of a long-term strategy and I kept having to just luck out and try to burst him down in the midgame, which is tough. It‚Äôs just not a great matchup. You should probably go murloc if you want to stay shaman. 
---
Quest rogue is a little bit different because her big thing is basically having one free kill per turn on any given minion. Hats in addition to her usual rush removal suite. This can make it very hard to maintain a board. The trick with her is to play lots of midrange and don‚Äôt give her anything to clear. You can either play a few beefier minions and deter her from attacking them, or you can go super wide with tons of lackeys and force her to use up all her removal. 
---
Either way, same as with priest, you‚Äôre at a disadvantage the longer the game goes on so whatever you do, do it fast.
---
Not unless they steal a few of your removal spells. That‚Äôs what I would do.
---
Really hope I they fix this BS.
---
This is one of the less broken murlocs... You should play more the game before posting some nosense...
---
Plague is great but you h e to consider you just gave him a board full of tribal synergy which can be exploited.

Congrats bro, I‚Äôve tried and failed so many times, but it‚Äôs good to see an old god make it there.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen anyone else mention it, but does anyone else hate facing Squemlish? I feel like it‚Äôs an auto loss.
---
If you cant beat Quest Rogue, there is no hope.
---
I‚Äôve definitely noticed that the earlier bosses feel imbalanced. The vast majority of the bosses this time have good healing/swarm abilities (the beetle herder and the suspicious tree), and others have surprisingly high burst when the AI isn‚Äôt stupid (the crockolisk that doubles attack can chunk for 16+).
---
Most of the current starting decks are awful as are the hero powers (Finley‚Äôs are bad if you don‚Äôt have anything on board and his 2/1 dies easily, while Reno‚Äôs spell damage buff is useless and the other two are powerful in their own way but the third one is the best simply because aoe). I‚Äôve lost a lot of my runs before boss 3 because I‚Äôd hard mulligan, not get a 1 or 2 drop, and the opponent would have a full board by 3 and win without issues.
---
If you have 2 it would cast the second
---
Play wild your old cards are all usable there
---
Sorry to burst your bubble, but it actually says in game who the 5th lord is. Just go to the last chapter and you'll see
---
i would open packs from each set in standard until you get a legendary, since your garunteed one in the first 10 packs of each set. Theres some solo adventure free content to kick start your collection as well which should give you a few packs and a death knight legendary. After dusting your wild stuff youll prolly be set to craft a deck or two. Currently mage is in a pretty bad spot in standard but if you wanna play it anyway highlander mage is your best bet. For up to date meta decks and analysis vicious syndicate released a new report today. Also you could consider playing wild since you already have the cards and you usually need to craft fewer cards each expansion so it would probably be a more f2p friendly option. But more importantly, just have fun
---
I have a friend who is an expert in cards. He will know a lot more about this than I do. Let me go ring him up and you stay right there

The way he says it

This is honestly better than a lot of the cardbacks available in Hearthstone. Amazing work!
---
I knew combo priest was rampant in legend but not to this degree
---
&gt;deal 420 damage
---
lmfao
---
to what degree?
---
Same. We need fix for this
---
Rank floors have been a double edged sword for blizzard. People find ladder to be more pleasant without the full reset but they play way fewer games.
---
Perfect 420
---
I've been doing this for Rafam and his dumb edgelord act in Dalaran Heist.
---
After playing whizbang for months I finally got the dust to make quest shaman and have been crushing with it. Hoping to actually gain a decent rank this season
---
I don't see it...even with the limited options
---
no shit.
---
I managed to kill him first time, i think i got pretty lucky with the treasures though.  I got the starting treasure that makes all enemy minions deal 1 less damage. This is pretty huge against boards of murlocs as often the plague lord will fill the board, although many of them can't attack. Also, the recycling treasure is very good too.  I think the other big saviour for me was getting a bucket with Frost-lich Jaina in it.  having the ele heals with many 1 health enemy minions to target with the hero to make more eles makes creating a bunch of ele's on your board very easy.
---
Jr. Tomb is so hard to activate
---
BY THE HOLY LIGHT!
---
Congratulations, you played yourself
---
Thanks for the correction!
---
I don't think it justifies calling it bad design tho. Dungeon crawler-games are typically very repetitive by nature. If that's boring to some people it's probably just not their type of game/game mode.
---
I'm baffled that there are 0 legal protections since you technically don't even own your account.
---
You could be like Kripp who's spent over $10,000 on hearthstone, get banned, and have 0 legal recourse.  I don't know any other area where you pay for a service or product and they can just remove your access because they feel like it.
---
Definitely going to have to see about all of that XD. üëç.
---
Same bug happen to me.The scorching dunes boss keeping the same hp after my second run.Feels bad man
---
I had the same bug too, except mine was with electra making it cast twice.
---
My experience with new game plus is a bit different since I've played a lot of Zelda games where you actually start the game over with nothing. I suppose that is why I think Blizzard's decision makes sense.
---
Admittedly, he was never the a ‚Äústaple‚Äù in much, but there was a time when him plus the +3 spell was considered a good finisher/clear.
---
"Yea, yea, this guy here. You know what to do."
---
I went for this in the heroic. 7th boss smorced me down. Feels bad man.

[All in!](http://i.imgur.com/V952Ioc.jpg) Four of a kind.
---
Beware though that there is a noob filter in that deck.  
---
If you're an idiot like me you'll play Azeri against the murloc plague in phase one, destroying his deck and making it impossible to kill him (due to lack of murlocs)..
---
You posted the exact same thread.
---
Aye! Me too, looking forward to it. \^\^
---
what did you run to modify it?
---
Jr. Tomb Diver into Hearthstone is ultra silly (in a good way). I just had a run where I restarted the 7th boss 5+ times.
---
Concede
---
I think if blizzard was to buff him  maybe he'd be better right? make him give you two perfect cards, or buff his attack and health to 7 and his mana to 4...
---
this can not be real sport and who gonna watch it
---
I like this more than any of the real ones! It looks like it is 3d, which is absolutely amazing, great work!
---
So far so good, having a lot of fun with it, enjoying the higher difficulty than DH.
---
Thanks for spreading positivity, and happy Friday!
---
Beat him in 1 go from 300 to 0 with a weird legends/overload deck. Had the elixer of vim (draw 2 extra immune to fatigue) and the alchemy stone (playing an odd card decreases the cost of other cards by 1)
---
Also the hero power to get a battlecry minion for 1 mana (overload 1). He isn't doing much against turns where you just keep playing 5+ minions due to insane mana reductions and a boatload of battlecries + shudderwock.
---
Also had the weapon that has battlecry buff your deck with +2 attack and deathrattle return the weapon to your hand. Shudderwock buffed my deck into insanity.
---
Reno's 3rd Hero Power is nuts. Especially against the Murloc boss.
---
If you can get the minion which increases Hero power damage by 1 it becomes a board clear pretty reliably. It doesn't increase the number of missiles, it boosts the damage of each missile by 2.
---
It wasn't even that for me. He had 2 psychic screams and 2 mass histerias which did the damage. Then the 24 attack cthun cleared my board and smacked my 21hp face :D
---
Also i would advice doging brawl it is a big if your op doesnt draw one of there 4 answers for your deck.
---
Spend enough money and blizzard will flip the rng switch
---
That's definitely what playing priest feels like
---
The worst for me is the entire fricking exchange at the beginning of every Millificent Manastorm fight. If I have to hear another shriek of "MIIIIIILLHOOOooooOoOoOOouse!", I swear
---
Good job! What deck did you use for the final push?
---
Mine never did.
---
Same, I had Reno's whip, the hand, and many ways to copy or shuffle in extra creatures. Stole all his cards in the second phase including a C'thun and then in the third phase he played a second C'thun and I killed it with the 9 mana cultist guy and then slammed a huge 54/67 C'thun for the win on the next turn. Felt great. Never saw yogg though. Didn't even know he ran that card
---
I didn't die as Lich King, both times I put as Reno a 2nd wing boss Heroic to \~150 HP, and both times it reverted to 300 hp :&lt;
---
Happening to a lot of people based on amount of threads in hearthstone bug forum.
---
If they want to charge 15‚Ç¨ for a mode that used to be free they can put that  work in
---
From 270 to 73 on chapter 2 - heroic mode. Now it‚Äôs gone and my feeling of pride and accomplishment with it.
---
Well, ya, it is. Solo adventures so far have been either the individual boss battles of all the early expansions, or rogue-like runs. But each one has new features, new flavor, and radically different strategies. The only exception is the Boomsday solo adventure.
---
The alternative is to basically create a whole new game, unless they can come up with something else like Boomsday.
---
I think the features of this rogue-like make it more fun than earlier solo content, and for 700 gold per wing (really 400, since each gives you 3 packs, so 1 week of doing the missions for gold)) I think it's a really good deal.
---
I think you would be shocked if you knew how many people play in wild with their standard netdecks.

---
So do us all a favour and frag off, space cadet.
---
No, i was legit trying to kill myself, that was the whole point of the deck.

It's the same recycled garbage we've had.
---
you are now guaranteed a legendary in the first 10 packs of a new set. so, i would start by buying packs from some of the more impactful sets until you pull a legendary. do you want to play standard or wild format? i recommend wild for returning players or players who don‚Äôt play every day or take long breaks. if you want to play competitively in the wild format check out the subreddit r/wildhearthstone, or find some cheaper decks to craft to start out with like mech paladin or secret mage.
---
Down to 167 and then back to 300. Not happy. u/mdonais fix your shit.
---
Classical secret warrior
---
Yeah, they have cheaper hero powers, but this doesn't make much difference as they are easily defeated during 5 turns avg. (or even 3-4 if the Scroll of Nonsense is used)
---
i personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth 2400 dust. try playing it without crafting those cards and see if you like the play style first

---
Wait, is this not SUPPOSED to happen on HEROIC?
---
Oh my god, I got him to 10hp and used [Hearthstone], only to come back to him at 300hp. And then proceed to lose the run.
---
#Unexpectedcrabnos
---
try picking different passives then, anything that affects tempo is usually good
---
Unlucky
---
Just to clarify.. That s the second boss right?
---
They removed boom's hero power
---
Huh, it didnt when I tried to do it myself.
---
Fuck, now I have to remember which card I used to hurt myself and it didnt trigger.
---
I also beat the first one in heroic first try, in fatigue. It was epic. I played the card that gives 7 Mana and discovers 7 I'm the first turn. I also had the -1 attack for enemies aura, which made it much easier. It still took me like half an hour
---
If you ever get offered Hearthstone you should take it.  Great way to save a run you designed for the last boss, just if you're about to lose use it to end the match and restart it.   It's helped me clear heroic for sure.
---
Same here. Got him down from 180-ish to 4 (in words: four) health. I felt I had luck with my deck and played well. Seeing him back at his 180-something health is very frustrating.

I must have missed it , do you happen to know in which one? Thanks
---
I strongly disagree. Not that the thing isnt fun. Its also obvious that it is the best so far also. But what did you expect? They are only adding stuff to the same dungeon run soup every expansion. The only thing they did differently was with the boom puzzles during boomsday. Honestly, Im tired of the same thing with a couple of more tiny changes each expansion. At least, when they were adventures, you got strong cards after each wing. Now you get a couple of packs of an expansion released a month ago.
---
So that's why...
---
last one was pretty bad too, especially after a patch, where all of the dialogue repeats again
---
Same here, European server. It's preatty frustrating since I lost almost an hour of playing trying to figure out if it was my fault or something. The first time I dealt him only 40 dmg and everything was ok, then I sent him from 260 to 55, but when I arrived the third time he was at 259 (?), so I brought him again to 94 and found him again at 259. But let's get realistic, Blizzard's just a small indie company, they probably can't test this kind of stuff before release so let's be patient and hopefully in a month or two everything will be normal.
---
I feel the same way generally, but Elixir of Vim + Elixir of Vigor is godlike (vim and vigor).
---
Draw 2 extra per turn + shuffle two copies that cost 1 into your deck. You never even get to fatigue, and if you originally have a lot of high-cost minions, you get so much value.
---
Only for real money in the web store.
---
Same with me, I just beat him down to 83, and he jumped to 274 for some reason.
---
Same thing happened to me.
---
If it was, People would hate on it like they do the slot machine that is quest shaman.

DK Jaina is very very good for longer bosses like the last ones. It's too bad you lose your custom hero power, but the lifesteal on all your elementals is awesome.
---
On non heroic he died in phase 1 to a 400 Attack crab. In heroic I have had no such luck. My deck had 7 crabs and double battle cries soooooo.
---
I just used jr tomb diver to generate infinite hearthstones so when I was loosing boom I could just start over. Killed him in one go.
---
Yeah I didn't even think about that. On normal mode, he could easily just fill his board with 0/4s. Doesn't work as well on heroic, since the 0-4s have taunt as well.
---
As do I!
---
The aggro decks aren‚Äôt too different from wild, but the control decks are.
---
Dragon priest has become pretty popular to clean out the aggro decks.  Turns out potion of madness and Duskbreaker kind of crush aggro.
---
Totem Shaman is pretty good.  I lost to it, tried to imitate the cards I saw, and immediately beat a secret mage.  There have just been a lot of good totems and totem synergy cards over the years.
---
I‚Äôve heard taunt druid with strongshell scavanger and spreading plague is pretty good.
---
Murloc Shaman takes on a slightly more midrange/value role; there‚Äôs no murloc warleaders, so you don‚Äôt kill quickly, but Underbelly Anglers work like death knights in a format with no death knights.
---
Apparently there are some pretty good control warlocks with defile, eggs and plague of flames.  You can also do the Expired Merchant Cruel Dinomancer combo.
---
Like...there‚Äôs tons of room to explore slower midrange and control decks that don‚Äôt exist in wild because they can‚Äôt beat Big Priest.  I‚Äôm loving this format myself.

---
Got wooshed with the oldest joke in the book
---
If you wait till he has 203 health (or close to it) then steal the hero power, kill a murloc and boom invunerable. I think that should work
---
He also got barely any delivery drones during the whole game. His luck was really bad, my monitor would have a hole in it were I in his place.
---
Please, hire some testers and do proper testing before release!
---
So, basically you're wearing glasses?
---
He got mechathun early in a very unfavorable match up, probably 1% to win, and slowly engineered a win through pure skill and played to his outs and won with the rng. A normal person would lose that match up 99.999% of the time no matter how lucky they got or how many mechathunes they drew or how many zaps they got.
---
All we see is the final straw, the last pushing point, not the 99% of the steps that lead to it with pure skill. jarla is #1 in EU and #50 in NA this season and there's a reason for that. He was also already 1-0 at that point so casie would've had to win another one, another match he may not be favored 99.99% like that match up.
---
If Jarla can with with skills in a 1% matchup in the second game, you can rest assured the third game was likely going to end up like the first game.
---
"Cast" has been very inconsistent.  Spreading Plague for instance says "If your opponent has more minions, cast this again" and yet it only counts as one cast for anything that activates with a casted spell.  Basically, anything looking for a "cast" to activate is just looking for "play".  
---
I do believe with Mysterious Tome, you've found the one card that says "play" when it really means "cast"
---
Ragtime lackey priest
---
Too bad you have that inferior "really good but not as good as dr boom" hero power.
---
That ending with Casie's webcam turned into color bar is so cool, movie like.
---
sucks to be in Casie place but damn that tilt is funny
---
They would make beautiful children lol
---
I rather see something like not counting enemy minions or not counting herself as a slight nerf if it were ever needed.  However, given the state of Priest, I'd rather see a complete rework of their basic/classic cards and then determine whether or not she'd need to be changed.
---
It was, at the very least, *incredibly* relatable
---
I get the feeling this is only semi-random. I think the random murloc has to be less than, or less than or equal in cost to your current mana pool.
---
are you from NA server?

secret hunter was the deck i got highest back in the day. got my custom N‚ÄôZoth secret hunter to rank 5. i was so proud of that. miss those days. haven‚Äôt played in so long i don‚Äôt recognize any of these cards :/
---
I beat it as well, I had the Gyrocopter so I never fatigued and I constantly was able to do 5 damage to all his minions. I also had Jaina so I would have to hit him for 3 with the water elemental.
---
He actually played 3 Codlight's in a row which burned me for like 40 something damage. I survived and I was lucky because he didn't get another Codlight for the rest of the game (which was 20 turns)
---
Tess. Only Tess. As soon as you play her, smack a scheme on her and your deck will be all Tesses
---
I beat it as well first time, I had the Gyrocopter so I never fatigued and I constantly was able to do 5 damage to all his minions. I also had Jaina so I would have to hit him for 3 with the water elemental.
---
Fun fact! If you hearthstone out of the boss no matter how much damage you do the second time he only keeps damage from the first engagement
---
Well that's a damn shame about the Plague Lord. His health keeps resetting for me.
---
The real question is how can he use two daggers if he only has 1 arm?
---
Considering that there is no decision to HOF mass dispel, I need to ask: are you're drunk?
---
I'm tired of how every Legendary I've opened since Un'Goro has been completely worthless because of the sheer power of silence. Stop printing useless cards or remove silence, if not as a whole, at least this utterly butt card.
---
If they can hold till turn limit they can have another try at the fight.  But that would be tricky, since murlocs will be summoned for both players over the course of 45 turns.
---
I never said that there was, only why I would oppose such a decision were it to be made.
---
Im not blaming anyone, I‚Äôm relatively new and did even know mage had that kind of secret support and was like where did this come from LOL
---
Well you do get new cards, just not for other parts of the game, havent seen people complain that treasure cards arent in PvP HS either.
---
Slot machine that is Hearthstone*
---
I think these first two wings are more difficult than the first two wings of Heist, but they are definitely winnable.
---
I expect most players don't win vs. the final boss in one go; if you're reaching the final boss but failing, be aware that there's a bug: they're not supposed to heal back to 300 when you fail against them, you're intended to need to reach them more than once and eventually whittle them down to win the adventure, you need to come up with a broken combo if you want to take them down from 300 in one go, and that may be the only way to do it now; not sure it's affecting everyone, but there are a lot of threads about the Plague Lords' health resetting between runs, for some, it's to 300, for others, it's to the health the Plague Lord had before the servers stopped updating Plague Lords' health at end-of-game.
---
Since a lot of the new treasures this time are absolutely bonkers, if you don't get one that's crazy powerful, it could also be tough to reach the final boss, since the opponents have been balanced against the new treasures.
---
Thank you for this. Can't believe I didn't see the three legendaries in murloc form before.
---
I‚Äôd say downgrade honestly
---
I've beaten both levels on heroic mode and enjoyed the challenge but in some games you just hit a brick wall.  The hero power that puts all minions on board into the enemy deck is insane.  Psychic Scream with no drawback.
---
Nah, once he draws a full hand, the surprise murlocs get burned.
---
Not tricky, but luck dependent.
---
Yeah, every priest deck runs 2 of it. Op af for only 10 mana
---
&gt; The opponents who played it in 6 of my last 6 wild games beg to differ.
---
You provide one simple example, this is not enough to confirm that mass dispell is played a lot in wild. Using HS replay I can see that it is only played in [less than 3%](https://hsreplay.net/cards/#gameType=RANKED_WILD&amp;text=mass%20dis) of decks in wild ladder. That means you face a deck that runs at least 1 mass disspell once every 33-34 matches on average.
---
I played Tess after playing dr.boom, replaying the quest and completing it!
---
Yeah I got it in my 2nd heroic run against murloc plague lord as the 1st treasure and I managed to make a deck that essentially makes the runs infinite with the reno treasure that let's you discover a treasure. I would literally go to the tavern every single fight
---
Oh look, ridiculous accusations. I wonder if it's specifically to get karma by attacking someone who's getting downvoted?
---
Fuck. I forgot you also get murlocs summoned which he would probably just kill. Ok, new plan. Forget everything I said, and pretend I was never here.
---
banne1#2847 EU 80g friend quest
---
I show, you go first
---
It worked properly for the 1st boss on heroic but the 2nd one just didnt go past that amount I got him to. Super annoying when you want to just chip hin down slowly
---
And why is that, exactly? It's basically a removal + threat in one, but only assuming that your opponent has something worth stealing. Since it costs 10 mana, it costs Priest entire turn, so it can't really be abused. And 10 mana cards are supposed to be powerful, or else they would be completely unplayable (and MC is barely playable anyway). The closest thing to a bad design was interaction with Grand Archivist, but that was because Grand Archivist was a questionable card (due to its randomness) and not because of MC itself. The card wasn't problematic ever since it was changed from 8 to 10 mana back in the beta.
---
Mind Control Tech, on the other hand, I can agree - it's unnecessary RNG and often puts you in the "high roll to win the game on the spot without any effort" situations, which aren't good.
---
The ultimate murloc weapon. Crab.
---
Yeah I learned that yesterday, such bullshit
---
Definitely a big part of it, always seem to get a broken combo that wins every game.
---
I've got her to work twice. The deck sucked, only made it to 2nd phase murloc boss in heroic.
---
Indeed, I took him from 300 to 30 just to see his health be at 170
---
It is a bug that started last night. It is not intentional. Theres no way to fix it yet but blizz knows about it.
---
&gt; Rhastakan's Rumble was bad, no getting around that. Poor story and poor replayability.
---
You can't select the shrine you want and the game does not track the shrines you already won.
---
How there would be replayability this way?
---
It's totally random as far as I know if there are 2 copies that would meet the criteria.
---
Play heroic, beating them feels like an accomplishment. Imho that boss mechanic is the only improvement tombs of terror brings.
---
If theres more than one, its random, consistency will always plague discard warlock
---
Especially since most of the decks beside the starter one seem to be very lackluster.
---
that's clearly a facetious question; every game has progression otherwise why even play them
---
Yep it's a tavern card usually costing 4 coins and there's a massive range of decks you can get from him. Tho even getting the tavern card is tricky to start
---
I can't win 'em all
---
Shoulda played around it
---
It's actually caused by simple mathematics.  High cost cards tend to stay in hand for longer since you simply don't have enough mana/opportunities to play them.  Since they're in the hand for longer, they get exposed to more discard rolls.  Since the get exposed to more discard rolls, then end up getting discarded more than cheap cards.
---
I played a lot of Quest Discard Warlock back when it was in standard :)
---
Dormammu, I‚Äôve come to bargain.

Got it for my first treasure right after seeing it hyped up on here, then proceeded to immediately lose the 2nd fight. RIP in pieces hopes and dreams
---
&gt; I think I like it even less than rakastahns rumble‚Äôs which is kind of sad.
---
Rastakhan's Rumble was quite quick but a lot more enjoyable than this one. And I'm not even talking about heroic.
