Ok but saying the game is dead because it has less Twitch views is stupid

I MEAN MAGE SUFFERED A LOT FOR THIS META... BUT I UNDERSTAND, BECAUSE PEOPLE LOVE LOSING TO RANDOM EFFECTS SO MUCH... BRING BACK INTERACTIVE CONTROL DECKS...
---
Orrrr... now hear me out. How about Zephrys always gives [Conjurer’s Calling]
---
lol, constructive criticism isn't bad, but excessive negativity is pushing me away from the game more than anything.
---
You lost the game, but gained massive respect.
---

---
You’ll never remember a single win, but you’ll remember the 4 Puzzle Box turn forever.
---
The resource problem could be fixed with counter and discard. How they implement those would be key though.
---
3/2 for 2 : Each player discards their highest cost card.
---
2/3 for 2: If this is in your deck and your opponent plays a 10 mana card, counter it and give them this instead.
---
Yesterday I played against 6 (yep, 6) frightened flunky in a game. The guy coin 1 on first turn, dropped on 2. Later the game he dropped 4 on turn 8. And he got the armagedillo from it twice.
---
With 72 legendaries a year, we should get at least half the dust for disenchanting. 1/4 was ok before that legendary cards storm.
---
Agreed. I'm glad Kibler isn't on the design team. HoF Mountain Giants? Even though they're already not seeing as much play in favor of Big Mage and Highlander Mage? Lol. 
---
A slight nerf to Pocket Galaxy is probably all I'd do. Raising the cost to 6 sounds good enough to me considering no Mage deck is tier 1 ATM. 
---
Warrior is definitely the deck we need to bring the hammer down on, considering it is the undisputed strongest deck and is blocking entire archetypes from existing.
---
I hear you.  I guess I’m just extremely cynical in this case, and I have a decade in Product leadership experience (the folks that would build a roadmap, approve making it public).  It really sounds like they are just grinding all the money they can out of the existing base, so would never reveal their plans (or lack thereof).
---
I’m not always negative, just case by case.  I was also very down on Fallout 76, for example.  That was correct.  Hopefully this is incorrect, but as a priest+standard player I feel like they are just trolling at this point.
---
The Cabal Classes. 
---
Mage, Priest, Warlock.
---
You’re missing 26 epics?!! There’s around 27 epics, did you get the same epic all the time?
---
Yes please!
---
&gt;The balance here is horribly shifted in favor of players that have been playing for longer or can afford to spend more on packs.
---
So? No one's forcing them to enter.
---
Yes game, I DO want ANOTHER desert obilisk and not Anubisath Defender or Crystal Merchant. It's not like Obilisk is just a less fun version of Mogu Cultist!
---
control warrior players are not human
---
I've played tons of Spell Hunter during RoS using Maly and Jepetto together. It most definitely would go well!
---
Call him a toast then, they are basically the same kind of streamer

50% is the standard value in card games.

---
it surprised me to see that. but I think this is a situational deck with very polarized matchups. against murlocs or similar board flood strategies, sure it's decent. but against control warrior or midrange decks that intend to control the board with moderate plays, it can struggle. decks will adjust with silence and transform effects if necessary, but a good midrange strategy should beat it easily.
---
Nah the bigger downer is 5 consecutive Bolf Ramshields
---
I sometimes wonder how devs have so much patience. Just look at r/fortniteBR, devs are really active in terms of their responses but some of these people they answer to are complete man children, or maybe just children.
---
The same goes for the HS subreddit only that instead of actual children there are man children.
---
Welcome bundle is probably the best bundle out there you can buy. Good for starting players, cause they get a dragon legendary (Ysera or alexstraza if they are lucky) and a guaranteed legendary from first 10 packs.
---
Still, you can't argue that a lot of answers from them are really non-answers.

---
Agreed.  I have the taunt warrior deck but don’t play it because the mirrors are a waste of life.  Instead I’m playing combo priest meme deck because at least it’s a fun surprise to win.
---
if blizzard don't announce something substantial at blizzcon, like replays, tournament mode, literally anything other than an expansion and a dungeon i don't think i'll be playing. that's what i think.
---
Brawliseum needs to be a permanent mode. I stopped putting money into the game because it's not (serious)
---
I started playing MTG:A just before RoS was released. I discovered that it had a *permanent* Brawliseum mode and I was hooked. I'm primarily a Constructed player and I want to be able to compete for prizes outside of drafting. When RoS was relesed, I was incredibly disappointed to see Brawliseum only last a few days and I vowed to make MTG Arena my primary game after that.
---
Please, Blizzard, make it permanent. Us Constructed players need the equivalent of Arena. The ranked ladder is a waste of time and it's not fair that those of us who enjoy Constructed can only play Brawliseum once every 4 months.
---
Curious you chose novice to compare instead of similarly powered cards like mana worm or cleric or sludge slurper (two of which arent going to rotate out like rover will)
---
Yes
---
HI IM DRUID QUEST I HAVE 0 DOWNSIDE AND IM ALWAYS IMMEDIATELY COMPLETED FOLLOWED UP BY 2 5/5s WITH RUSH AND A SPELL THAT HEALS FOR 12 AND SUMMONS A 6/6 WITH TAUNT AND THEN A WHOLE LOT OF BM BECAUSE DRUID PLAYERS ARE UNIVERSALLY COCKS

you achieve the max rank which is master and you never reset ranks,you can grind 10000 points to go to grandmaster and you get to master again in the next expansion.Queue times are very quick in any rank.Game is more f2p than hearthstone if you focus in one class first, you will usually have cards for all the classes.But balance fucking sucks in this game meta can go to fun and interactive to shit in one expansion....We are in the shit meta now.
---
I thought TES:legends was pretty good. It has enough of an enjoyable grind that if you really put your nose in it you can easily become competitive on ladder.
---
It's about the viewership, if it wasn't obvious enough.
---
Do what I did, save up for 80 packs by doing every event and daily gold quests. Spend it all when expansion drops. I got 8 legendaries (2 golden), a dozen epics, and all of the rare and commons. I got to play 3 high tier decks on day 1 by spending minimal dust
---
This is me right now. Btw what's going on with Hearthstone? I haven't been playing for a few months, but I am seeing a lot more negativity in reddit than usual.
---
Okay..?
---
HI, IT'S ME, 1 COST PHARAONIS INTO 2 CONJURE'S CALLING. HAVE FUN!!!!
---
A stale meta can not only be a result of poor balance, but also a result of the game being too expensive for people to try out new things.
---
Thus, people will laser focus on the best Tier 1 decks (because most players will be able to afford 1-2 decks) and the meta gets flooded with them.
---
Fuck, picture didnt post
---
May not be the best suggestion but what if booms battlecry revolves around Magnetic? Something to the effect of “Battlecry: Give all mechs in your hand Magnetic” granted it’s considerably worse but it seems more in flavor with making and adapting mechs while nerfing rush
---
The only good thing about control warrior is armagedillo play sound
---
While I’ve always loved to play control warrior, I do think this card is out of hand. It shouldn’t be nerfed, thought. Just HoF the mofo away
---
NA TRADE Spudy#1828 message in game 80g DONE
---
I just saw HS hoovering around 11k on Twitch. I never thought I'd see that. Just a year ago it would NEVER go below 40k. People are leaving, attention is waning and Blizzard is doing nothing to at least ameliorate it.
---
Now your going to be reincarnated as a demon lord
---
1/5 for rares also I believe
---
TFT keeps you playing LoL and in the LoL client.  It doesn't have to create massive revenue stream but keep you hooked on the "main" game, LoL.
---
But yeah, over time surpass Hearthstone (like continuing from a  year from now) and not just a hot trend.  I recognize it's only a few months old so we'll see how the playerbase grows over time.
---
The game is just stale due to lack of features. Twitch numbers are plumetting.
---
I have definitely played more mtg arena than HS this last year, I just also like HS but the econ kills me from paying anymore
---
Honestly it will give me a hell of a fair chance with those mechs not having rush.
---
I would for sure stop playing if they introduced a battle pass. The economy is already too punishing for f2p players.
---
ok well .. move to 9 mana, no more rush, only 5 armor on play and 5 armor hero power.  That would be the minimum imo.
---
27 Unique Epics.  54 total copies as you can collect two of each.  I'm counting total copies as many decks you need 2x.
---
Yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head. People are leaving because they can’t play the decks that they want to play or the ones that their favorite streamers play, even after paying a decent amount of money. Fixing the dust refund system would be a step in the right direction.
---
Idk where you got this idea
---
I hate you. Take my upvote.
---
Yep I dont get this either if anything this was probably the biggest diference ive felt in a rotation for me the game went from unfun to fun again
---
This page in the sub's wiki has some suggestions for "starter decks" [Beginners Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/bisn5q/hearthstone_beginners_guide_year_of_the_dragon/)
---
The budget decks I prefer come from HearthstoneTopDecks (no epics or legendaries) [HSTD](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/hearthstone-budget-cheap-decks/).  There are guides on what to upgrade first.  They haven't been updated for the new expansion yet, but I am sure you can get creative with substitutions until the site updates them.
---
Yet the majority of them are justified, why else use reddit if not to communicate?  In this case it's to communicate ones displeasure.  
---
People will leave the game over the next month and it will settle back down.
---
Yeah but for the 12 year olds on this sub complaining about devs the way they complain about their parents' bedtime rules, it's extremely empowering to see thousands of upvotes for their tantrum.
---
It's a free, relatively harmless, way for some to let out steam. I say we let them be.
---
Devs have seen worse, I doubt any is losing sleep over this.
---
Those are neutrals that every deck and archetype wanted to run. So not really the same but kinda close.
---
Thanks for making Hearthstone fun sometimes and for not playing Warrior
---
And whats so bad about whining?
---
Nah. He just is unplayable.
---
Hey, I have a quest shaman deck, just need to add a couple legendaries and... Oh that's right I have no other legendaries.
---
lol 10 spells plus hakkar
---
Better be dust in my wallet afterward!
---
I'd guess you're trying to complete the quest and draw into a 0-cost Glinda Crowskin. Then you Glinda, Cultist 6 times, Grim Rally on Glinda, play a seventh Cultist.
---
The Balefuls are to make sure Glinda is in your deck to get for free.
---
Hakkar is what Nine Lives generated.
---
The weapon has one durability left, and looks to be the rogue hero power dagger.
---
Yeah then idk.
---
Noones going to miss you
---
I like how people bring up OW. How much do you care about communication when devs don’t do shit to make the game less stale for a year anyways? They killed their own game by refusing to address the obviously problematic meta. Fuck communication man I didn’t need Blizzard to hire some idiot to give me insight to development when they actually made fantastic games. It’s so overrated. 90% of fan suggestions are stupid anyways, I just want them to make good games again instead of games built around maximizing transactions and using unnecessary RNG elements to make it addictive.
---
Byes
---
Wow...that's insane.
---
If this was true, how are wizards so successful maintaining a dozen different formats WHILE having nothing to gain from the secondary market?
---
😢 too soon man too soon!
---
You're assuming the replies that you want, which isn't reasonable. 
---
On the first one, it's entirely possible that they actually do want to see how Boom and Conjurer's Calling are shaking out in the new meta. There have been precedents where cards that were oppressive at the end of one expansion became solved by the meta of the next expansion, so the real answer might actually be the dreaded, "We're keeping an eye on this" that the community always bitches about when it's given. 
---
On the second point, and this is absolutely not something that the community wants to hear, the price of the game isn't arbitrary. It's set at the current level because that's where they believe that they can generate the most revenue which is, ultimately, the purpose of selling games. People scream greed and poverty all day long, but none of that will ever change the realities of doing business. Increasing the amount of dust in the game would certainly feel good but unless there's a good reason for them to do so from a *business* standpoint (e.g., that it would draw in more players), they don't have an incentive to do so.
---
And, once again, your third point is assuming an answer that you want to hear. In particular, they have explicitly stated that they won't be separate mobile and PC clients. That's never going to happen because the bulk of their revenue is mobile. Asking them to spend resources on the PC-only segment of the playerbase isn't realistic. As for delivering a tournament mode, we know that Blizzard never likes to deliver a product until they can polish it and until it meets their internal standards. Given that they already scrapped one attempt at making a tournament mode, it's clear that they're not going to release one until they are ready to do so, and we they're absolutely not going to announce it until it's actually ready to go. 
---
The real problem is that you're asking for communication; you're asking them to validate your wishlist of features and changes. I will state that I actually would like to see more transparency, but that kind of transparency would often mean having to tell the community things that they don't want to hear because not everything the community wants is something that Blizzard wants or is able to give it. 
---
As you well know, this is not a community that's prone to showing maturity in the face of disappointment, so I'm not entirely unsympathetic to the fact that Blizzard is often tight-lipped. Low-level bitching is probably seen as easier to manage to outright riots (especially given that we do have a history of giving the absolutely worst possible reading to the announcements that we do get).
---
I would love for this to change. I would love to have an sub when devs and players could engage in an open exchange of information, but I'm kind of cynical that it will ever happen, and I think that the fact that we're always packing pitchforks is at least part of the problem.
---
That’s not a control deck at all
---
So glad I got it golden back in Boomsday. Looking forward to all that dust.
---
Those cards *are* perfect, but you are too imperfect to properly appreciate them.
---
Being a problem/Limiting design doesn’t equal making a horrible deck to force a problematic combo. How hard is that to understand? Your logic is that nothing is a problem unless you auto include it regardless of supporting cards.
---
They could do a f2p version like most games do.
---
Ooooo aggro war finally nudged out combo priest.  I've been playing it with octodad and loving it.  That combo list is unreal though too
---

It's not practical to code Zephyr to always give polymorph/hex/silence every time there's a big deathrattle minion and you have more than the exact mana for that particular spell since Zephyr takes so many more variables into account like health, number of minion and their stats, your current mana, etc.
---
Just do what u/Uatthescool suggested and tutor Zephyr to the perfect card. I think Kripp also made a video on how to play Zephyr. Don't over estimate AI's, thinking that they always know the perfect card no matter the current scenario. The AI is only as smart as the data it has available and the people that programmed the damn thing.
---
At 9 o'clock on the diagram you spelled hearhstone. I believe it's called nerfstone.
---
I assume you mean Hearthstone Deck Tracker?
---
hearthpwn had its own companion program, Innkeeper, which could do the deck import/expert too, but it was a different program that only worked on hearthpwn.
---
HDT's version worked in nearly all HS deck sites. I'm not sure how they worked - they either looked at the in-game logs, or read the data stored in the computers memory associated with hearthstone.
---
Took me 6 whole years to get that sexy bird
---
You can get one from finishing the Dalaran Heist in regular mode
---
Wait? You rolled 28 times? Oh you mean on the 28th spell cast?
---
To be fair if you dusted two of each card you listed that is still less dust than one pack on average. Just seems like a PITA to do.
---
Proof that simply releasing expansion after expansion isn't the solution to maintaining interest in the game? This is only twitch viewership but you can assume the overall interest in their playerbase is following a similar trend. 
---
It doesn't seem the adventures are going to do the trick either. This is just a thought, but the adventures cater more to the casual player, or those who are F2P or spend little time and/money in Hearthstone. Whereas the more dedicated players, perhaps those who watch Hearthstone eSports, and those who play more and (sometimes) spend more are the ones who don't have any interest in the Adventures. I personally fall into column B. I have zero interest in the adventures and they cost too much for me to buy them to play them once or twice.
---
It seems extremely obvious to me that this pattern of 3 expansions per year accompanied by an adventure (assuming that trend will stick) is just FAR to repetitive to keep people interested. Blizzard absolutely needs to do more, especially now that HS is 6 years old, but they are seemingly reluctant to do so. How many times have we seen the response, "we have a ton of cool ideas that we're really excited about". It's been years and these cool ideas haven't even been talked about, let along implemented.
---
Personally, I enjoy a couple decks from this expansion, but I can already feel myself getting bored because so many of my games are the same thing, including a health dose of bomb warrior, and Blizzard isn't nearly active enough in keeping the game fresh as I would like.
---
Back when Yogg first became popular, I had a Yogg deck for every class except Paladin and Warlock. Good times for ez quests.
---
Four. You can break even also with 3 but if you are unlucky sometimes you will get only 1 pack+40 gold. 4 wins guaranties that you are slightly ahead
---
lmao what was he playing? probably a netdeck...
---
and its still damn close. warrior is so broken
---
I am not advertising but Dota Underlord has 2 different modes for Mobile and Desktop respectively. HS devs team can try improving Desktop version while testing which and how it could be implied on Mobile version.
---
I do not understand the devs team idea for this.  Equity is different from equality. They cannot just let the game lack of features forever because mobile cannot handle it.
---
I've been playing Hearthstone for years, and I honestly couldn't even tell you any of the CMs names.
---
For another game I play, Runescape, not only could I tell you all of the CMs names, I've had personal interactions with most of them. They've responded to my feedback and I've even seen some of it implemented. And get this... Runescape has a bad reputation for its community management, and many players have views that they aren't being listened to closely enough. What does that say about Hearthstone?
---
As much as I love watching Asmo, he's nowhere near close to Thijs' &amp; Kripp's numbers. Over the last week, Thijs averaged almost 17k viewers, Kripp 14k and Asmo only 3.5k
---
Yeah how do you forget the only relevant mech with rush come on lol
---
If someone talks about moms and dads while trying to insult a person they cant be over 18
---
Warrior is mediocre in wild in any control sense because of the same reason it's kept in check in standard by mage. It auto loses to big priest because they don't have enough removal to remove all their threats which is why people are playing aggro to hope to beat it before then. Mage has too many threats for the removal warrior has. Warrior is also only good because of Boom. Literally any warrior player will tell you this because the class is being held up by that card at least in any control variant. 
---
The only card that I would say is an outlier is really the power level of Omega Devastator. Even by itself without boom or having 10 mana it's still a vanilla 4 mana 4/5 which is very good still. Throw in the 10 mana effect and it's really over the top. The card is overkilling Giants and that should tell you enough. Boom is fine. Most people would agree OD is the problematic card at the moment.
---
Activision is milking Hearthstone for every penny they can get. They have halted all development on features the community have been begging for a long time. They are only focused on getting an expansion out every 4 months and popping back on Reddit once an expansion drops to interact with the community and promote the expansion in order to sell more packs.
---
The second one is totally unrelated, the best players can afford to make good decks and experiment, meanwhile f2p players lack the resources but can still improve their previous decks. 
---
Also is not like a nobody has ever introduced a meta breaker, stats tend to help people know what’s the meta.

The Jade Golem Lengendary whose name I forgot
---
look at a mirror and speak that to yourself instead of guessing/judging others. it's chicken soup for your brain of the day.
---
That would probably make him stronger as he would be easier for you to play around with. As he is now, you don’t know what power you are going to get, so you can’t really play out your turn planning to get the 3 damage hero power next turn for instance. Your opponent on the other hand gets to know what your power will be and can plan accordingly on their turn. Your proposal wouldn’t be a nerf, it’d be a buff.
---
Precisely. It was incidental. OG Quest Rogue is so non-existent in Wild that I highly doubt they deliberately did it so that it wouldn't be played in that format.
---
I hope this isn’t serious.
---
r/Unnecessaryapostrophe
---
Even the increased power level of cards from this expansion plays into that idea. There are a ton of new decks created from this expansion, but they all require at least 3 new legendaries and 6 new epics in order to build. The dust cost of Hearthstone cards is becoming unsustainable for anyone except the people who pay money, and that is by design.
---
Just do what I do: disenchant every card from the classes you hate. That way you lose the chance to play Druid, Rogue, and Mage like me so I have just enough dust to craft one card for the one deck I currently have.
---
Then open up a random rogue legendary despite the fact you still have fucking rogue at level 15.
---
You sound like you are on the cusp of breaking out of it. This is the second expansion now that I skipped out of and it feels great now. I spent quite a bit on this game and had the exact same reservations you currently do, but sometime something new will come along and you'll say "huh, i dont NEED to spend for this expansion - I'll just use the dust and gold I have." Next thing you know, it just doesn't interest you as much anymore and you move on. I treat hearthstone as a spectator now rather than a player and it feels great.
---
Don't get discouraged, if you are falling away from it, you'll find something new!
---
Hall of Fame him and mountain giants.
---
Ok thanks for the advice! Ill try this while waiting for a response to my support ticket
---
I hope you're right and we'll see some action from devs. But I really doubt it. It's a lot easier for them to just keep milking the cow until it dies and then just say "oh well, people just got tired of the game, it's not our fault, the game was perfect but even perfection gets stale".

How is that a bad thing? Getting bad cards can decimate a new player, specially since there is always a meta, not being able to play a decent deck and be forced to do something with what you have can be very frustrating.
---
I just reached the halfway mark to Golden hero with my Pally I'm so excited. And yes my shaman is so fun, especially since they added all the murlocs!! 💖💖 Mrrrgggll
---
:(
---
People who play wild don’t want to buy packs, the point the other guy was making is that it’s much more efficient to craft neutral commons and rares that are strong in a variety of wild decks to get a better experience. You still need some legendaries in wild sure but there are many cheaper options, and Once you have them you always do. 
---
Wild is cheaper by a huge margin, anyone could make a good zoo or aggro deck for a few thousand dust that will never rotate.
---
9-3 ON BRAWLISEUM AGAINST, GUESS WHAT, 3 BOOMS ON 7. AT THIS POINT, WHEN THIS POS CARD WILL GET NERFED IT WILL BE ONE OF MY HAPPIEST GAMING MOMENTS.

Yes, and no. I made it out of sheer boredom, but just added extra cards to screw over big priest.
---
I've been playing since beta, very close FTP the whole time. I save my gold and buy about 50 packs with it each expansion.
---
I don't do terribly well in competitive, usually getting to around rand 10. I have a great time playing though. I use wizzbang almost exclusively now day. 
---
Anyway. Different strokes for different blokes. I have fun
---
Malygos is great too!!! And thank you!!!

Orange juice drinking, ripped shirt Kripp was the best.

Gods was he strong then.
---
They're talking about the Ungoro quest, \[\[The Caverns Below\]\] which if countered basically made your deck useless.
---
I just had to dust every single card I have gathered over 2+ years of ftp to make a single meta deck

chanoodles#1563 trading 80g quest. Ill show you go first.
---
The PS4 is a bad analogy, each card is not a standalone game in a library.  And when you spend $60 you get the entire game and if it is an older game you get massive discounts as time goes on.   The issue is the price of the game going forward as you need to keep spending money incrementally 3x a year for the same game and you don't get the full game (or even most of it).  To get close to the full content, you probably need to be spending $150 a set, or $450/year and playing quite often to finish dailies.
---
* Fun is subjective and some people like "bad" cards and decks. (Even Blizzard Devs say so in justifying printing bad cards)  You can't control which cards you get and the disenchant values are very bad for converting duplicates into cards you want.
---
* The best way to learn to counter specific decks, or realize it's weaknesses, is to play said deck.  That doesn't make you a worse player and again, some people want to play different decks at the cost of winning.  Your definition of fun isn't necessarily theirs.
---
* Sometimes cards are very weak competitively when released (DK Rexxar and DK Gul'dan) and become OP later.  You can't determine which are "sleeper" cards or which will get synergistic buffs later on.  The inverse is also true. Some cards are very strong for a few sets and then not competitively viable after a key card is nerfed, meta shifts, or new card released.  A wider collection means you are more resilient to these changes.
---
* At least with Legendary cards, when you dust them, you have a chance to re-open them again.  You are actively discouraged to do so or risk losing 1,200 dust in value.   
---
----
---
So no, maybe you don't need a full collection but you do need good value for your money spent.  (and we're  not getting it)  And if you don't have a good collection, or cannibalize your current one at a massive loss to stay relevant in Standard, you aren't going to get into Wild which is supposed to retain older players who leave for a while or just want the nostalgic feel fo the game.
---
Full value, but you get to keep the card and you can in turn disenchant that. So really, full dust value plus disenchanting value, or 2000 dust in this case.
---
I don't think that the expansion itself is necessarily bad, but I just don't think it's what the game needed.
---
Yes it is worth it but buy 1 pack at a time.  It is *up to 10 packs* not 10 packs.
---
So it nerfs a few mechs you might randomly discover and snip snap. You still get rush on the front half which is the problem.
---
Huh? Whizbang is only standard cards so you would be making it harder on yourself playing wild. Only time I've queued wild with whizbang was by accident.
---

They could make it purely just for testing decks meaning that quests wouldn’t be able to be completed or you couldn’t earn gold for every three wins. Maybe they’d lose income but they would probably gain a fair amount of popularity again as new players could enjoy the game and not worry about owning every card.

You intentionally rope every turn, yet someone playing a game how they want to play it is being a dick?
---
I'm not saying your a dick but some might look at purposely roping a dick move.  At the end of the day how you decide to play, be it your deck or using your full turn timer every turn then so be it.
---
You need to learn order of operations man. You need parentheses around that 4*2 or else it's a completely different problem resulting in 26.

No, you would always do the multiply first unless parenthesis were around the additions. You know, PEMDAS?

They even fucked up the "meta is fresh people are having fun" part by releasing the expansion to the streamers early.
---
Yeah, I would like a "Choose a Deck From Your Collection" option next time.  I just copied the code from HDT each new run.

Maybe, how often do you get to burn through your deck though?
---
Ok but malygoose

Roping another player is being a dick, and you are insignificant in this player base and will never change anything loser.
---
If you ladder you're a literal retard. It's fucking pointless.
---
Just remembered Tomb Warden and Harvest golem gets nerfed  , the point is to weaken some of the bigger play makers and not completely kill the card. Nerfs are a very finnicky thing and is more complicated than just "Nerf this, nerf that" like you want a card to perform worse but not become unplayable like what happened with Force of Nature and Cenarius
---
I did just that, he ragequit.
---
You need to learn order of operations. PEMDAS: Parenthesis, exponents, MULTIPLICATON, division, ADDITION, subtraction. Multiplication happens first.
---
Keep it!

Boom shouldn't be nerfed. Cards which counter it should be printed.
---
A rogue card that benefits from the opponent having armour would be fair.
---
If boom ever got too oppressive people would tech in cards that disable hero powers.

There are some anti-roping mechanics for first two turns.  Some peoples step away from the game between turns or playing casually.  Also, I will occassionally rope as I look up opponents deck on HSReplay if I see an unusual card or don't know your deck.
---
Which is why kabal lackey has always been a terribly designed cards. This happened when the first quests were introduced too. Casual turn 1 mana cheat

Yes.  It is probably a Tier 1 deck right now.

I'm defiantly not against that but the problem is that he is only going to be in standard for this expansion and the next. I really don't think blizz is going to HoF him this close to being rotated out naturally. But I do think that is what should actually happen and not just with Boom either. I think they should just Hog all 3 of the hero cards and just get them out all at once.

---
It isn't my intention to defend the gold cap or to suggest that it is reasonable or healthy. I'm simply acknowledging how it works from Blizzard's perspective.
---
Of course it hinders casual players. That's the whole point of the free-to-play monetization scheme. Casuals aren't meant to be making enough gold per day during their lunch break to earn all the content. They are supposed to be frustrated into buying a "great deal" at only $5 and spend more once their credit card is on file and Blizzard's foot is in the door.
---
I agree. I'm still pretty new to Arena, and I still find it fun, but the lands are pretty annoying. I do appreciate the flexibility in multicolored play they add though.
---
 No need to play, just login daily like 30 days login to get 1 epic/legendary ticket or dust amount
---
I think this a sign that you should stop opening packs.
---
Are you really complaining about a card that is totally RNG giving you a bad roll in a situation that you were really behind???
---
Boom is the reason control warrior is so powerful, and, what with it being a big reason behind frustration of playing against control warrior, it's the problematic card that requires a nerf or some kind of change.  Or there will be nerfs due to it (ie something losing mech tag).  
---
Basically, just because control warrior loses sometimes doesn't mean Boom isn't an issue, it's pretty clearly VERY powerful.
---
I'm sorry I'm new ;-;
---
It's just that since playing (I started mid-RoS) I haven't seen any decks that include Ysera. But considering the comments here, it seems like I'll be keeping her hehe
---
I agree. But the mode should be free to enter. Making it cost gold is horrible.
---
We like Hearthstone here, we just want to make it better.

His fault for running frogs in his big priests deck
---
Meta isn't stale, you still meet a lot of decks but the problem is exactly what we feared before the expansion : Mage is still OP because Galaxy and CC are dumb strong, Warrior is still OP because they got strong cards to reinforce the control warrior. At least I meet less bomb warrior...
---
I feel like all this complaining about doctor boom is kinda lame. He is a card that is now 3 expansions old and has only "just" become a massive problem?warrior just got some crazy cards this set that are problematic in themselves. That and for once the meta is very value driven. 
---
There were defiantly some decks that smashed control warrior in Rastakan, and doctor boom was being played then.
---
Problem is warrior just got some super synergistic card this expansion
---
I Upvoted for constructive comment. Fuck this sub these days.
---
It's alright, I know we are a dying breed
---
Help the game. The barrier for fun is too high.
---
Ye
---
One of the problems here is this you need to be super lucky to have every phase card in the same time, otherwise you are screwed.
---
I'm tired of the people that defend control warrior
---
There are still people defending blizzard for this comparing the cost to entertainment and claiming if you can’t afford it you shouldn’t be playing it, truly boggled my mind.
---
I mean im not planning on buying any cards anyway. I play Tft and Underlords now and i gladly spend my money there. These games introduced more features than you guys in 5 years.
---
Make it 400
---
I guess you weren't around when apm priest was in standard.
---
It's a bit crazy that he has lots and lots of different suggestions for Boom, but when it comes to PG, he's just like "well, increase the cost".
---
We already know that PG is practically unplayable at 7 mana and that it's oppressive (albeit very high-roll-ish) at 5. I'm going to go out on a limb here and claim that it's not magically become a balanced card if you go for the only mana value that remains in between. If it works neither at 7 nor at 5, then there's something wrong with the card other than its cost. So why not tinker with its effect instead? For example, it could be that it halves the mana cost of cards instead of resetting them to plain one. Won't change its viability as a combo enabler (though it has never been used as such, I'm going to agree that his idea about what it's supposed to be sounds cool in principle), but at least we won't see 10-mana minions getting played practically for free. Or make it an ongoing effect that reduces card cost every round you keep them in your hand; something like a permanent Thaurissian. That way you can't topdeck into multiple 10-mana minions in a row either. Or make it a quest reward; druid already had a "all minons are free now" quest, and it was neither oppressive nor unplayable.
---
I guess you are playing with friends back then hence “don’t care much who win or loses, at least we had a fun time pulling off whacky combos or come back”. HS you either play arena or climb the ladder, in which “efficiency” is the word if you are even mild interest in the game and netdeck the highest win rate deck is the logic choice with limited dust.
---
I would maintain the rush mechanic but give it only to the first played/summoned mech during your turn
---
Thank you drawing attention to the lack of features. Adventure 4 times in a row with no real innovation and now it costs money.
---
I thought the new bar mechanic would give you like...a case of spare cards you can swap between matches.
---
And since there are more warriors then aggro decks, it's a win-win condition.
---
Im playing Mision Maly Druid. Oh god, its super satisfaying to fuck their HP from 50 to -10.
---
*sad warleader noises*
---
done
---
Ain't that a bit too broken?
---
well its a new game and a new genre,so constant balance change is needed because even the dev doesnt know how to make the game totally balanced
---
Someone did this to me and I didn't see it coming at all. I dunno why.
---
&gt;A minor change in functionality, not even a nerf
---
This is actually so wrong though. The interaction with Sonya was the best thing left in the deck, without it the deck is entirely unplayable, not even meme tier.
---
I got one in a game the other day using the 1 cost add a random mage spell to your hand spell that I can't remember the name of, but I already had the quest so after I finished the quest I just played it again lmao
---
&gt; All it requires is that you look through the patch notes from the past year, especially ones from 2019 to see all of the extra updates they've made to this game,
---
ahahahahahhahahah
---
you just need a small break to erase that sunk-cost fallacy out of your brain
---
- turn one op conced
---
- you can muligan the quest in matchups you know that it is irelevant (against aggro when you know the match will be decided before the reward comes out)
---
Didn't know about Morrigan, that's nice to hear. Gloop Sprayer and Glowstone are definitely sitting on the at the higher ends of theirs' respectful tiers, but still aren't quite good enough, imo (I understand tho, that stronger buffs could be bad, but Sprayer could've easily been 4-5. Glowstone is already good, I just didn:t feel the impact that much on the overall metagame. All in all, this tiers are still subjective and aren't fixed by any means. It still shows that 17 out of 18 buffs turned out to be good.
---
Assuming you’re talking about the Dr Boom hero card, it is unlikely he will be hall of famed. Also you can still play hall of famed cards in wild
---
I'm still not a big fan of your analogy, although I know what you mean. Hearthstone itself didn't change it's "formula", it's still the same card game. The problem is that as adventures were removed and more expansions introduced, that requires use to spend more time and money to gain enough cards to build the decks we want to play. Players are forced to grind all the time just to spend all of the gold on the first day of the new expansion, which usually turns out to not even cover half of the decks.
---
Looking at the results you are not the only one. 
---
If Brawlosseum I prefer wild. Or later after release. Or any other crazy rules like limited sets.
---
There was a (1/31)^2 = 0.104058272% chance of that happening. Congrats!
---
&gt; then why should it be?
---
1) Less players, less revenue
---
2) If the game lose players, it became less popular and so attract less whales
---
3) Harder matchmaking
---
4) Lower pool of spenging player have to mantain the entire game, so it will raise the cost 
---
Fortnite, LoL and tons of other games can earn way way more throght skins. Why can't HS do more with skins and lower the price of packs and have a better dust system?
---
its basically lvl 1 warlock spellstone with a minion/mech synergy and leave a body afterwards
---
Haha I do this. It's a roll of the dice because I'm too impatient to wait until the meta settles, so there's a chance I could be left playing a redundant class, like Priest. I can't believe I tried to make Priest work for the last few years - when little did I know they're Blizzards least favourite class.
---
I'm slowly moving to Wild so I'll add my 2 cents.
---
Baku and Genn are the best legendaries you can craft. You craft one and it opens a plenty of different archetypes. For example Odd Rogue and Odd Paladin - both super strong decks, are using Baku and Patches, Leeroy (classic) and optionally Loatheb that is used, well... in every deck where you want to lock your opponent. Those cards are and will be good.
---
Rest of the deck: Odd rogue is using only two Wild epics. Some greedy versions are running one copy of Shadowcaster. Rest of Wild cards: 3 rares, a lot of good commons and that's all. From standard you have cards like EVIL Miscreant, SI:7, Sn1p-Sn4p and so on.
---
Odd paladin: here you are using 4 epics - 2x Corridor Creeper, 2x Quartermaster. Also, you use 7 rares. Rest of the deck are commons from both Wild and standard (Never Surrender, Owl etc.).
---
You don't want odd decks? Sure, I have secret aggro Mage for you! 1 legendary (Aluneth), 1 epic and a bunch of commons and rares. Go forth and burn your opponents!
---
Don't like aggro? Go combo! For only 3.3k dust you can have co-co-co-combo priest! They will never know what hit them! You can also go for dragon version too!
---
You are a cool, even person? Even shaman! I run a version without Aya and the only epics you need (2x Sea Giant, 2x Thunderhead) are playable in standard. Rest is just a bunch of rares and commons. You probably need ~3k dust for that deck.
---
You want to see some crazy shit like lethal from priest on turn 5 without Divine+Inner Fire combo? Here we go, aggro shadow priest is for you! The light will burn them! (Not legend viable but crazy fun)
---
You want memes? Oh boy, do we have memes! Bombing hunter! "Taunts that go face + Sulfuras" warrior! Treachery, mill your opponent twice and discard their heart warlock, 850 armor per turn shaman, summon 7 RA rogue, shadowcasters infinite combos! Deathrattle combo-wombo-you-dead! Summoner stone shenanigans and so much more.
---
Ok and now about cards to craft: you have safer crafts than in standard. For example Mad scientist will always be good in Mage and Hunter. Genn and Baku are safer to craft than Siamat, Reno-like cards have more support in Wild, Belcher is go-to taunt, Loatheb is go-to lock enemy for turn play and Sneed is love, Sneed is life (but don't craft him if you are not into memes). All of those are usable in many archetypes and will be usable during next expansions and after standard rotation.
---
And you know what is even more fun? Reno decks can be cheaper in Wild than in Standard...
---
All the deck tracker should be signed correctly with an appropriate certificate. Are you Windows and having issues with HDT, or is that a Mac?
---
I disagree. I think that it needs a bit of refinement and to wait for the meta to settle because it can rise as a counter to quest pally and aggro decks.
---
just nerf the 7 armor hero power to something like 4 and on play it only gives 5 armor like other hero cards. seems minor but could go a long way
---
Quest Paladin can pop off real hard with a double crystology opening against King Krush combo Hunter. Glad to know somebody can farm them.
---
how is thunderhead not broken ? because the decks it's in are not t1?
---
They fucking massacred my boy
---
Just because you put an overpowered card (e.g. DKs) in every class does not make the game balanced. The other remaining Hero cards ‎Zul'jin and Hagatha do not even come close to Dr. Boom as it is. When every class had a DK card it was even worse because more games were decided on whether you draw a specific card just because they were so strong. No single cards should decide game the way DK's and Dr. Boom do.
---
i wouldnt mind trading any basic hero power for "gain 7 Armor each turn", "Discover a mech each turn", "Heal for 3 and give +3+3" or "your battlecries trigger twice".
---
):
---
It's pay to variety. If you need more variety for fun then it could count as a pay to fun for you, but I don't think that's universal enough.
---
How is getting 7 armor for 2 mana or discovering a meca bad in any archetype (expect aggro hunt) ?
---
You can always play Quest unless you're greedy with the coin. I don't see a problem here?
---
There are many quest druid decks: tokns, Malygos, apm...
---
but when you can safely say that 90% of your matchups are against Dr.Boom warrior or Quest Shaman/Priest It would be worth, as these quests are universally better than any basic hero power
---
The belt buckles are switched. 4 fingers. No abs. Monocle on wrong eye. No pockets in the pants anymore. Nose gone.
---
sigh. You had one job, graphic designer. One fucking jop.
---
I agree with Kibler's suggestions, but I do think he forgot one thing; the current meta. When you nerf both mage and warrior, another class might reign supreme even more. They have to theorize this first.
---
From the top of my head, Highlander hunter might become tier N. It's already good versus mage (has a very decent winrate because of the SMORC you can do) and holds its own against warrior. Also has tools versus aggro (although limited). And with the boom nerfs, bomb warrior might not be a good enough counter.
---
But I still think something has to be done. Right now, no single control deck is played because warrior does it better. Nerfing warrior would improve decks like control shaman and could really freshen up the meta. As it stands now, cards like Lord Jarraxus are just useless and outvalued by doctor boom.
---
Can you tell me about one budgetish i got lots of druid cards , i got all of the classics and the ones from uldun
---
Warrior strength is complex problem and Boom is number one reason why it is so strong (wouldnt be surprised if other warrior cards most likely classic set will be nerfed\HoF with Dr.Boom soon) and how you tech at the same time against  mechs,armour,rush,magnetic,heropower,weapons,aoe etc. Teching will be always bad idea unless it is any kind of tournaments or singleton decks, in ranked you should just switch deck if winning is your goal and  tech cards against murlocs/pirates/secrets is totally different story. Also MechaCthun is already there despite decks that already super favorable against control warrior but that is not the case.
---
Will you ask everyone about what rank they are?
---
If I pre-order for 50 bucks and am able to play a single deck then it's even pay 2 variety. We're playing word games here.
---
I’d probably play this in my singleton mage. 
---
In the worst case it’s a 6/5, in the best case I get boom or quest HP
---
I think they just need to remove the discover, that way you can just out value him in the long run. Maybe make sure no hero power can hit face that way you don't need healing.
---
my change for conjurers calling and pocket galaxy is pretty simple just use the played mana on cards like these. so a mountain giant played at 4 mana will give two 4 mana minions. same would be true for devolve and evolve cards aswell.
---
this would make conjurers calling and pocket galaxy bad together, it would remove the mana cheating mountain giant and get architypes were blizzard expected them to be.
---
while for DR.boom i think kibler is right on the money. i belive i said when the card was revealed that 7 armour was insane since you aren't really losing your hero when you play him. DR.boom needs to cost more than just his mana cost since his effect is just that good. also just remove the mech tag on the tomb warden taunt warrior and mech warrior is too mixed together right now.
---
overall both issue cards right now have one thing in common to much support.
---
How is giving them all rush different from giving them all +1/+1 or casting inner fire on everything in your deck? I don't see why you assume adding a keyword to cards in your hand and deck is challenging.
---
You 👏 don't (clap) nerf (imagine in doing the clap meme) cards one week after release.
---
The swap every turn is linked to the hero power, not the hero. If you got boom and somehow changed the HP, it stops swapping.
---

---
🤯😵
---
Not true. He's good, yeah. Main problem in standard is that most other classes don't have an equivalent hero card. The power level is unbalanced. He only became prominent during RoS, after the other Death Knights rotated out.

If by first time you mean the last four months non-stop then yes, it is the first time.
---
What do you mean by the first sentence?  
---
I'm not playing wording. Variety is what you're directly getting, fun is a possible (and common) indirect consequence.  
---
Saying you're paying for fun is like saying you're paying for sex when you get a hotel room. Sure, you may intend to use the room for sex but what you're actually getting for your money isn't sex it's a hotel room for a night.
---
Maybe he should set your armor to 7 regardless of what it is currently. That's often a nerf against control while still being mostly the same against aggro and makes more sense, since the armor you have gained is irrelevant once Dr. Boom jumps into his mech.
---
Yes extremely hard, it also costs loads
---
You called it indeed.
---
Cenarius was once nerfed?
---
I've heard of teching a card against one matchup, but teching an entire deck? Geez. Not to mention the WR against anything else (especially mage) is abyssmal.
---
The problem is this game is impossible to start playing now. You need 5 XP's of card and the class set to have decks. So you are slowly bleeding off old players and you create an environment impossible for new players.
---
Unless I'm missing something this is an external companion application and not developed by blizzard.

I mean still is cool and all but just shows how much even the China community is starving for features.

This tournament mode(and this app) was developed by NetEase,NOT blizzard.

But it only avaliable for China server now.

Minimum 5 turns to complete. Yes its easy, but its slow. Druid quest is both easy and fast, you can literally afk the whole way through.

I just hit rank 5 every month to get free 400 dust + doing quests. That's it. I barely play HS. Why? I can't afford all the meta decks. I would play brawlesium instead of arena if it was a permanent mode.
---
I really doubt Twitch numbers even matter as much as people make it out to seem. The number of people watching people play the game is nothing to the number who actually are playing the game.
---
Twitch numbers are not directly tied to the health of Hearthstone.
---
I hate standard, and have played zero standard games for more than two years. I have not a single standard deck. I only play Arena, sometimes a brawl if its fun, and sometimes wild meme decks to get my gold for arena runs.
---
Brawliseum is the worst. I dont have a standard deck besides whizbang.
---
I love that the best use case for this card was to get double Justicar priest hp in the tavern brawl Nefarian raid.
---
Thanks!  Will try this out
---
And attack sound
---
Ngl it might be a huge pain in the ass and potentially overwhelm you with Taunts, but c’mon it’s still a cute little guy
---
With Rexxar it was clear that it was a pain for them to arrange card text properly and dynamically. I'm not saying it's impossible but certainly not the same thing as Keleseth and Mistcaller.
---
Not even vaguely close? Rly? Jaina and novice engineer might not be vaguely close, but Boom does very similar things as Jaina and has the major advantage of being an incredibly fast card due to the rush part.
---
I am pretty sure replacing the rush card with some weaker buff of mechs (like +1/+1) would not completely kill the card but make it a good choice for mid-rangey mech decks and harder to justify for other decks (and that's okay).
---
I won't call zephrys 'win more', much like kazakus was never a 'win more' card. I think Blizzard cannot make any excuse to nerf it without refunding 1600 dust, so zephrys is a really safe craft.
---
&gt; To put it into context you need most cards or a full collection to truly get a full sense of experimentation and be able to field all sorts of differing decks.
---
This is not true at all. Most competitively viable decks share a bunch of cards. If you wanted to experiment building mage decks and came up with 5 different decks, you'd need to craft around 15 cards that would be the same across all decks. This is true for every class, the basic skeleton from which you add and remove specific packages stays the same not only throughout expansions but years of standard. 
---
In the same way, packages are usually very similar from class to class.
---
You can craft every single deck in the latest Vicious Syndicate report and you'd be extremely far from having all or most cards in an expansion. Most cards in the game don't see play.
---
Make changes wherever you feel necessary it is still very unrefined
---
I 100% agree with you. Your criticisms along with the explosion of the Autochess genre where you can play with all the units for $0 has resulted in fewer new users joining the game as compare to the number of players leaving the game.
---
My hunch though is some time in the future, Blizzard will be forced to address this by adjusting the economy. I'm not really 100% confident on that prediction, but it's higher than a few years ago when they were breaking records of revenue and player activity.
---
yes yes u can play n game they have official tournaments u have to just download the plugin that's it
---
insert \*you have no power here\* meme
---
It's a thing in pretty much any physical card game.
---
Dr. Boom, easily.
---
I mean, by literally 1 stat
---
Shaman quest decks are pretty cheap, it might be a good option as you already have the quest
---
This is almost as fun as 7 Omega Devastators.
---
Try otk priest
---
Yeah! He's still uploading every day.
---
But did Blizzard make the plugin themselves, that's my point
---
Genn was a big problem for sure, but Evenlock specifically ran it because 1 mana tap meant you could get to turn three and jam mountain giant. Take away the giant and that deck would see significantly less play.
---
It’s like you’re willfully having the worst take on this. It doesn’t take months of saving for anyone to play a wild deck. Not to mention that same problem exists even worse in standard when you consider how hard it would be for a new player to have a standard meta deck with cards from the last up to 6 expansions. The comment above yours is right genn and Baku go a long way in wild just with your basic and classic set alone, and from there it’s easy to dust some gold cards to fill in the final few commons and rares. Seriously read the comment above yours and try listening to the people that actually play wild, there’s a lot of lies about the format and one of the major ones is that it’s dust prohibitive. Wild will always be much cheaper than standard.
---
All of the friends I've gotten into Hearthstone still play after years, and we're all F2P.
---
It doesn't require any cash to participate. If you enjoy the game but don't want to spend money you can do so with cheap decks and arena. If you got tired of the game or could not participate in the very specific way you wanted to do so, that's a different story.
---
Bro this was his turn 3 play after I played one egg xD
---
Awesome. I guess I’ve just got YouTube algorithms to blame
---
That would be too minor of a nerf seeing as the problem is cards like dyn-o-matic and omega devastator are more of a problem, almost always 2-for-1ing with their battlecry + rush, plus the fact that they're class mechs making it hard not to discover them off of delivery drone.
---
I get that it's subjective but getting lethal'd by "created by"'s feels really terrible. I think it's somewhat fair when players have to sink mana into it, the most noticeably "fair" card here being Espionage but when they don't and Shimmerfly gets yet another big removal spell or the "randomly generated" Lackey was Kobold Lackey, it's kinda awful.
---
Huh?
---
Dr. Boom was already huge in Rise of Shadows and with credit to the set rotation removing nearly every other Hero Card, as well as Journey to Un'Goro Quests. His boost in SoU is really not that substantial.
---
Kalecgos
---
I’d say hunter is the most f2p friendly class. Most hunter decks are cheap. You can go with something like bomb/mech hunter. There are good budget versions of this deck.
---
Who would have thought it would be better to have them turned into murlocs instead of legendaries
---
Agreed. People make the false assumption that just because a game is old, it'll decline. At some point that becomes true it's just the when the "old" ness starts to kick in. A lot of the reason why the game feels old right now is because of the product decisions they've made.
---
shiv#21445, EU
---
I'll show, you go first
---
People crying about warrior when paladin gunna be the sleeper cancer
---
I sincerely quit the game for a year after the nerf. I put Grim Patron as my flair at that time in memoriam.
---
&gt;No new game modes are expected this year. The focus is on improving existing systems and doing unique events to shake up the meta.
---
lol, i bet it's just a 500 gold quest.
---
It says “swaps each turn on it”, right?
---
I addressed the armor.
---
Fair enough about the resource generation.
---
Maybe the discover a mech could be nerfed as well. Perhaps "Discover a Mech that died this game" or "Discover a mech that costs 3 or less".
---
I realize that all of his powers are OP, and could snowball. But if you take away rushing mechs, or only have rushing mechs, I think it's more balanced.
---
What if you could choose between the rushing mechs and the randomized powers? Maybe that would work better, what do you think?
---
Honestly these cards, sure they are meta warping, but fundamentally right now I am more concerned by Priest in Wild and it's res mechanics, as a player of both modes.
---
“Hmm, what should I play in a game mode where the main idea is to have fun? I know! I’ll play the most boring, autopilot, and least innovative deck ever made!”-That Fucking Big Priest.
---
It's shown in the collection?
---
No, people have said that sideshow spelleater copies it.
---
+1 for zephrys, +420 for meme golden colossus/octosari
---
used to be my goto tech against warlock as priest in LoE.
---
Druid quest is also insane, I made a homebrew druid with almost purely Choose one cards, and it's sitting on ~75% winrate at ranks 15-10
---
Why is the keyword necessary though unless there are cards that specifically interact with the keyword?  No cards care about "Recruit" so why is it important that Hooktusk has it?
---
No, they haven't, and if they have they are wrong.
---
He asked for how he “played” 4 tho not how he got 4
---
Pretty sure he is just stupid
---
Tess also didn't get anything really new, she's as playable as before.
---
Oasis Surger and Floop are a great combo once the quest is complete of course.
---
I like control warrior, just not in the current iteration because i hate the flavor of mech warrior. I currently play a dragon control warrior (its not good) and its pretty fun. I like the play style of controlling the board early game and then just dropping huge minions (dragons in my decks case). I miss the old flavor of warrior where you would use weapons to control the board early (RIP FWA) and armor to stay alive while doing it, just to get to late game and start dropping bombs (not literal bombs, unlike current warrior). Alex into Grom is one of my all time favorite finishers.
---
Would you have had lethal if your Zilliax had had charge?
---
No.
---
No. Resurrect cards rez a new copy of a minion. Completely different from cards that change stats of existing minions.
---
Resurrected cards are still 4/4 under Crystal Core.
---
Doctor Who?
---
We already have orange glow for combo.
---
A lot of people, apparently. In fact, there are more tier 1 decks in casual than there are in ranked in Wild from my experience.
---
I’m out of the loop. What’s the nerf on caverns?
---
Why would Twinspell, a mechanic that does not need an outside incentive to play like Secrets, not constantly see play in Standard if it is printed on new cards?
---
Of the eight Twinspell cards, six of them have been seeing some level of play since Rise of Shadows released. It is an extremely powerful mechanic, especially at low costs like Ray of Frost.
---
The only reason the other two aren't really seeing play right now is because the decks that would want to use them aren't really good enough right now.
---
It is not a mechanic that should be constantly revisited, much like most of the other expansion mechanics.
---
They didn't scam anyone because this is a game mechanic change and a card nerf, and the streamers are smart enough to realize that, unlike posters on the forums.
---
It's not like you can only run mechs in a mech deck. The game would be really boring if all you had to do were jam in cards that had the same keyword or worked directly with that keyword. The way Magnetic works makes new mechs really interesting moving forward.
---
I used to run this card back in the league of explorers /the grand tournament meta, as with Reno Priest I could get outlasted by Justicar Control Warrior, so I would steal their hero power game to win in fatigue. Good times.
---
You have no arguments lol. You've managed to add nothing in all of your posts.
---
1. No Duplicate Epics till you own 2 of all Epics of that card set. No one likes having 3 Mortuary Machines in their collection but not a single Micro Mummy, or Psychopomp, or Mogu Cultist.
---
2. 5g/win instead of 10g/3 wins. Increases consistency, gives you that FeelsGood feeling every win, and increases gold income from winning games by 50%.
---
3. Pauper Format. Much easier to play high quality decks when there is a game mode that only allows Commons and Rares. Mostly an Aggro/Midrange fest most likely, but that's quite alright. It doesn't have to be as exciting as Standard; it's still fresh gameplay for old players, and accessible gameplay for new players.
---
Those are my "top 3," I think.
---
Some of the Quest hero powers aren't even good enough to either copy or bother putting a tech card just for purpose of sometimes copying it. And while you spend six mana copying it, you give your opponent tempo to deal with the minion and continue building their board up. Your deck is unlikely to have the same caliber of synergy to make the different hero power as strong as your opponent.
---
And while Dr. Boom is strong, you're probably going to lack the Rush passive as well as the other mechs in your deck. Right now, you can copy Jaina's DK power, but Jaina will have the lifesteal passive from elementals, cards that likely diminish the health of minions so that she can generate more elementals (e.g. Polymorph), and other elementals that she can heal with. 
---
All too often I think people fall in love with the idea that a tech card will salvage a matchup when in reality, the stats show that nerfs or switching your deck is far more effective. Blood Knight wasn't enough to prevent Giggling Inventor from being nerfed, nor was Golakka Crawler able to do the same with Patches.
---
well right now it is not, but someone said that sometimes keywords come back
---
so what if we have a quest in a future expansion working with "recruit", that card won't be playable with it, just because they decided to do the power with a big text instead of keyword
---
also from a programming point, a keyword is handled by the same piece of code for every card while a special text is usually handled on a per-card basis, a developer should always prefer reuse an existing working function instead, so use the keyword
---
What I really like is when the meta finds a place where rock paper scissors happens with aggro, midrange and control.
---
He definitely doesn't. 1 to all, summon microbots, discover, armor, zap.
---
I have 45%  of legends golen including wild. Zepyrsis the best Legend this expansion. I am a Hunter main so brann 2 is good if you run highlandder decks. Otherwise the biget zuljin and rexxar for hunter. The Dks like rex guldan jaina and malf are great
---
It would kill the deck. That removes tap-tap-giant, it would set back taunting up with sunfury protector/defender of argus by a turn, etc.
---
I will have you know that my dog is a top Legend player
---
Yea no, the Quest actually just isn't good. Drawing 20 cards is an awful condition. So on top of the Quest being a dead card, you need to run Plot Twists which are 2 more dead cards. And for that to work you need to keep a large hand(besides starting with a dead card you have to play turn 1) which means you're not doing anything. 
---
If you manage to find a Plot Twist you still only complete the Quest on like turn 7 or 8. What are you doing in the meantime? Probably dying.
---
And even if you complete it it's not that good in the lategame.
---
But now since he plays more games than just hearthstone so many people give him shit anytime he tries to get back into it. It’s no surprise to me he hasn’t streamed since the new expansion especially after that card reveal debacle
---
I have octa golden collosus i dusted zeph i have crafted
---
And there is no way that they could make this global?  Isn't Netease the ones who are developing Diablo Immortal for all platforms? I am sure they can translate the text pretty easily.
---
What about “your mechs with rush and charge have -1 attack”
---
I would argue that aggro and control (more like attrition / grindy midrange decks, theres no true control in hearthstone) decks are both equally skill testing. The issue that most people tend to get caught up in that for most of Hearthstone's life, aggro decks have been very strong so they tend to have a low floor. But people seem to forget that aggro decks also have a high ceiling. Exactly because your plays only involve the first few turns, the margin for error while piloting an aggro deck is razor thin. Every minion you play early on matters especially because if your opponent has a sweeper, its gg if you overcommitt. Taking a mulligan is also a much more important skill to master when playing an aggro deck. Lastly, closing out a game, knowing when to trade vs go face is extremely crucial when piloting an aggro deck.
---
For control decks, the early turns don't matter as much since you dont really have plays early on. There are certainly decisions to be made but the key difference is that a control deck has comeback mechanics via sweepers. So I'd say control decks have a higher skill floor but a lower skill ceiling.
---
Putting something remotely playable from classic set into hall of fame 👌
---
Hello. My name is Dave. I have never spent a dime on this game. It was hard at first. I got better at Hearthstone and it got a lot easier. Then, my collection even grew. It kept doing so until I got to the point where I could make whatever deck I felt like. 
---
Explain what about that makes the developer seem greedy? You're saying it's because there is some paid content? That same content can be gotten entirely through in game currency that is obtained, once more, for free. 
---
It sounds like you're more describing lazy players than greedy developers.
---
I opened like 9 copies of call to adventure last expansion and I didn't even pre-order. That came out of something like 50 packs.
---
In "Trump reviews Trump reviews: Boomsday" Trump states that Dr. Boom helped carry control warrior from Tier 4-5 to Tier 1-2. Sure, you could argue that that is *only* because of the supporting tools. But then again, every card has to be seen in the context of the meta and the supporting deck. There was never a great control hunter with Deathstalker Rexxar, even though that card was undoubtedly powerful.
---
When did I rage about anything? You're calling other people illiterate. Maybe take a walk or something if Reddit makes you angry.
---
Mass RNG card generation more like. FN itself is fine, same as Omega Deva. Its just not fine when they generate multiple copies of it out of thin air.
---
Making tomb warden a mech may have been one of the most braindead things about this xpac.
---
Just got out of a game where the warrior played Armegadillo on 6, boom on 7, double 5/8s with rush on 8.  Absolutely stupid.
---
Putting rush in a button seems like a good idea
---
Playing this card in druid atm would be incredibly good, and consistent too. Texh cards don't salvage matchups, they provide weighted swings, which this card would absolutely do. Would it be a staple? No. But it would be a reasonable choice.
---
Not having rush is pretty sucky, but the hero power itself is a huge upgrade from most others, and thats really good in itself.
---
We have a semi midranged meta AND warrior is the only control deck, because it's just miles ahead of other control decks.
---
Let's agree to disagree, I've stopped discussing online years ago ;-). It never benefits anyone really.
---
I use this card in my steal priest, a deck thats usually not that good so whatever ^^
---
But I‘m not sure if it works against passive hero powers, at least in solo content i don‘t think it does
---
Reno was a huge problem. Kazakus only wasn't one because it was overshadowed by either Reno, or Raza.
---
Hi, thanks for the summary. 
---
Does it support open decklists?
---
Login rewards aka 15 days get a legendary card, increase dusting value for wild cards, or set dusting value of wild cards same as its crafting value, more hidden quest, make a trading economy, opening 10 to 15 packs guaranteed a legendary, more daily quest. Just my opinion, but my opinion will definitely break game marketing policy.
---
Yeah. At this point Wizards might as well make Landfall evergreen between Tireless Tracker, Evolution Sage, and the new Omnath, it's popping up enough outside of Zendikar.
---
 don't think the warlock quest is very good - because it's not easy to complete and the reward isn't that good.
---
The quest is a dead card. Plot Twist is a dead card. 20 cards is a lot to draw. You need a huge hand for Plot Twist to be good which means you're really not doing anything.
---
If you manage to find a Plot Twist you still only complete the Quest on like turn 7 or 8. What are you doing in the meantime? Probably dying and definitely asking yourself why you're running dead cards.
---
And even if you complete it it's not that good and doesn't really cover your lategame.
---
Nah I wish. No mana cheating for warrior.
---
we are hitting the krip salt levels wow
---
I had a complete top tier deck on a new account the day I made it. Fuck off with your p2p nonsense.
---
Hoenstly.... Zoo warlock is a problem for damn near anyone lol I hate seeing that deck
---
It's funny, I'm looking forward to any type of mage with Highlander Hunter. Either that or any quest deck
---
Yeah but a 7 Mana do nothing was just so hard to pull of that you sometimes died the turn you played it, I feel like there has to be some middleground
---
Cards that benefit from the upgraded hero power. The amount of reborn cards needed to complete the quest will never change, but what you use the hero power for will.
---
Lmao. Don't emote me bro. XD
---
... check the names of the opponents. That was last game that he conceded and got mad. I played quest turn 1, he conceded and flipped out. How would I be messaging him while playing him?
---
Read my above comment
---
The problem with quest priest is your opponent can play around it by not damaging you, and killing off your units so you cant heal them.  No other quest allows the opponent to influence its completion.
---
I agree that some reborn creatures are balanced and interesting. But reborn is already a strong mechanic in a place like Arena, so why put a good deathrattle IN TOP of a minion that already has reborn. I've seen a ton of Karthut Defender and Grandmummy. And Priests sure love to. Combo them with Wretched Reclaimer... 
---
Maybe you're right, maybe I'm against changes but I think I'm against changed for the worse.
---
Secret mage wrecks shaman, quest or no quest.
---
Sometimes mechanics can just be unworkable.
---
I'm a Johnny, but I like Control Warrior. The problem is Spikes forgetting a new expansion is out.
---
We can keep it in one thread, topdeck's source was my post.
---
(plus you didn't even link them as your source!)
---
Above that. He then proceeded to call me a cum guzzler and to kill myself.
---
Its a mistake you make ONCE in your career haha.
---
New quests are more consistent versions of hero cards. You might not draw Boom, Hagatha pr Zuljin in time, but the new hero powers are easily activated so more consistent.
---
If thats the case, then thats a risk you take by coining out totem.
---
Spike just play the best stuff they can. Plus, they have added Saviors of Uldum cards into their Control Warrior lists.
---
It's not always black and white like that. A lot of times it's not easy to tell that a card is going to be OP until it's out in the open and hundreds of thousands of people are using it. Not just the few hundred that are internally testing the game.
---
Honestly, replace “players” with “decks” and that’s how I feel about most broken cards.
---
Most cards in that set were born in the wrong game.
---
I think hunter is great, just takes too many turns to finish.
---
I think if your curve ends at 5 mana it should be considered greedy as well. It is funny that the term is only used for heavy Control decks, but trying to win by turn 4 because your oppponent didn't draw an answer it is not considered greedy for some reason.
---
I only play the solo adventures which I really enjoyed last expansion. It's disappointing it doesn't come out with launch.
---
I think you needed both to do that
---
That would be the best thing
---
I mean, Highlander mage has a good winrate in standard, but I can see if you don't want to have a non-flexible deckbuilding legendary
---
Nothing is safe yet cause I don't think people have fully experimented with all cards yet.
---
&gt; I’m saying the quest will die, wild or standard because there’s only a certain amount of reborns
---
Look dipshit.
---
* The quest isn't even alive in Wild it cannot fucking die.
---
* The quest will die in standard when the card rotates, because that's also when reborn minions rotate.
---
In loe it worked properly
---
As a kid growing up i put a couple of bucks on average in an arcade machine just about everyday at 7 11 or wherever. Hearthstone at $150 per expansion is about $1.25 a day. I will say my friends and i joked and wondered as well at all the money we had put into video games if we had it all back what we could buy with it. We were 18 then.
---
The deck runs x2 Eggs, x2 Whelps, Kangors, and Undatakah, the Warrior simply does not have enough removal to deal with all of the Paladin's threats.
---
I’ve beat one by counterspelling the first bees and having enough elemental control to block his slow rate of jade propagation, meaning his armor was much lower.
---
Hero Cards should've had special Hero powers that had a finite number of uses (then they revert back to the base hero power). You could put a visible timer at the bottom of the overlay to let the players know how many "charges" are left.
---
* Forces the player to be more mindful of resource management, which should be a skill that is rewarded in HS
---
* Allows for more interplay for the opponent as they can feasibly "outlast" the effect or try to force the opponent into using it inefficiently
---
* Opens up design space for devs to nerf or buff hero powers that are too strong/too weak by giving them more/less charges. You still get to keep the 'soul of the card' but can still effect it's impact on a typical game
---
* Allows devs to create even more powerful hero powers without the worry of the "inevitability problem" that cards like Boom, DK Guldan, Jaina and Rexxar presented.
---
So, when this trio cycles out, I hope they consider this idea as a way to re-introduce Hero Cards in a healthier way in the future.
---
*
---
I don't mind the warrior matchup either. I do cringe when I see play though. Like tip the scales just always beats me I have yet to win a game against that paly deck. Maybe only like 5 or 6 games but they were QUICK. Like zephrys can bale you out with shadowflame or hellfire but I found i could never deal with the second tip the scales, or you know I'd just die to murlocks on turn 4. I feel you on mage though I have a great winrate against mage even when they drop lunas on 5
---
I was joking? Isn't it obvious?
---
He just spent 3 dollars for this.. who really got trolled here?
---
It should, but it may be bugged
---
Hes talking about undertaker Hunter, whole different power level. Then again, this control Warrior is also broken imo because it can go toe to toe with almost any value deck. It polarizes the meta because to beat it you need to be insanely greedy and auto lose to aggro (battlecry shaman and Quest pally). Meanwhile warrior gets tons of value and the best early game removals and board clears
---
Yeah, but you don't have to go Spike all the way.
---
Team 5 is not going to induct Classic cards into the Hall of Fame outside of the first set of the year.
---
NO SHIT THE QUEST WILL DIE IN STANDARD WHEN IT ROTATES. I’m saying it’ll die in a sense of no one will want to play it because the way to complete the quest is extremely limited compared to other quests.
---
Can someone explain this to me. Is it open to everyone or do you need to be playing in asia?
---
Boom HoF or rush removed  
---
Brawl to 6  
---
Crier to 2  
---
  
---
Luna's to 6  
---
Zephyrs to 3
---
Druid already beat control warrior..? Not much would change. It would go from a favorable to a very favorable.
---
I mean, despite the fact that they are keeping an on going story for this years xpacs, it seems like they want to keep coherent themes.
---
Plus, even though it's a DIGITAL game they dont want to have to go back and change a buncha keywords if it would fit a new ability better
---
Tempostorm being a meme again lol
---
It works fine. Just not working in a single player mode (most of the time???).
---
No, Big Red Button is a hero power that transforms into five different utilities at random each turn.
---
You *are* able to just copy Big Red Button. That is what your photo shows.
---
Why would brawl get hofed? Warriors only classic aoe.
---
If the game wasn't so expensive people would maybe experiment more
---
If we were talking about something like Azure Drake that is a very solid standard card still, absolutely, but when it’s a tech card, that argument doesn’t hold weight. If it had any relevancy at all it’d see fringe wild play. According to HS replay it’s in .7% of wild decks and has been played just 170 times. That’s nothing.
---
Dr Boom is really really strong right now. People are complaining and some are making jokes like this.
---
Pure Spikes are the sort who will constantly go all the way because they can.
---
\[\[Blessed Champion\]\], not Blessing of Kings.
---
I don't even think it should he nerfed at all.

Let's be real. Dr. BOOM never was a problem until   Omega Devastator came out.

I started playing this game in closed beta, so yeah, basically everyone like me has been scared away. Enjoy playing your stale dead corpse of a game.
---
I dust pretty much all mage cards. I've been growing my collection recently because I wanna get all classes golden (4/9) so I need to grind mage eventually
---
I don't do well with predictions like these, but here goes anyway:
---
* Conjurer's Calling - increase cost to 4 mana
---
* Dr. Boom, Mad Genius - all hero powers with this hero now cost (3)
---
* Luna's Pocket Galaxy - increase cost to 6 mana
---
* There should probably be something done with Hunter, but my crystal ball is fuzzy on what should be touched.  Probably several things.
---
* If the new Priest deck is for real, then something is likely to be done to it, but I'm not sure what
---
* I think it's slightly more likely than not that some Rastakhan's Rumble cards will be buffed, similar to what they did with the Boomsday cards a few months ago.  This could affect which cards get nerfed and how.

* I'm expecting nerfs in the next 3 to 6 weeks

Conceptually, I don't like Priest. Their two most common strategies are Control or Combo/OTK. The only Priest I've ever really been a fan of was Dragon Priest / Spiteful Priest. They're otherwise the "anti-fun" class. Control Warrior is beating them right now in "anti-fun" but Priest has it more as an identity whereas Warrior's "control" plan usually leads to them actually trying to win the game - old-school wallet Warrior for instance was fine in terms of being a deck that tried to play-to-win rather than simply negating your win-cons.
---
I'm not going to explain the logistics of why casual players are wildly important to a f2p game but that's fine bud. Enjoy playing hearthstone it is truly a quality game.
---
An ice to meet you
---
Every single card works like that though. True mana cast will always be shown when the minion is on the board. This applies to every minion. Corridor Creeper as an example.
---
Yasu#1509 NA, I show, you go first.
---
It will be swept under the rug. You won't get anything for it sadly.
---
Yep, sorry. Forgot about that card lol
---
I'm on the completely other end there. Mage is my favorite class and was my very first golden hero. Also the first and currently only class I crafted whole golden decks for.
---
Oh sweet congrats to you as well. Hunter was my first to hit 500 so it’s definitely my top class.
---
can we trade?
---
Is it really that good? I need a dozen wins to get me a golden portrait and I unpacked Amet already.
---
Depends what context you're talking. From a "you can bring any deck, anywhere" concept, none. From a social, being a decent community member concept, you can make the case that bringing one of the top decks from standard into the lowest rank of wild is really bad form - they're going to grossly outpower the average rank 20 player, and even if not, if those people wanted to play against standard decks, they'd play standard.
---
Ultimately the guy did nothing wrong from a technical point of view; and from my point of view, the vent alleviated the annoyance of not having any place to play truly casual Hearthstone and occasionally running into people with less than casual decks (ironically, in the actual queue this was legitimately about half the time). Basically, they got their win; I got my stress release from this post. :-)
---
My opinion is keeping the rush as is and changing the hero powers to make them random effects and also slightly nerfing them , so delivery drone adds a random mech , blast sheild gives 1-7 armour , etc.
---
He just saved himself 30+ mins of misery, smart play.
---
Welp, guess this wasn't as special as I thought
---
For real though, Hunter having access to Twisting Nether and Pyroblast, is some damn bullshit
---
i would even accept google translate standard...
---
What a great thing that literally not a single soul is supposed to play something that caters to YOUR liking. Those damn people playing the way they have fun. MADMEN!
---
Every suggestion on this just changes the numbers on daily wins. No. Having to win can be really punishing for the newer or weaker players. Make it number of games. Or cards played.
---
Its the best thing about MTG arena - "play 30 green cards" is an awesome quest. Having to win can seriously suck. You can put a minimum on rounds or time played or cards/mana spent. But having one hour to play each day and losing five games because of reasons and bad rng and the opponent having 7 legendaries vs your one.. It's the most demoralizing thing.
---
Wait are we talking food or women? Love both btw
---
If I could pick 1 card to revert the nerf in Wild it would be Yogg. You've got puzzle box these days which allows for wild unpredictable swings that won't stop part way. No reason to not revert Yogg at this point.
---
False. It is dormant
---
It's called "grandma gets confused by options so we'll just lock everything down".
---
Quest Paladin is honestly the most fun and balanced deck so far. Not super high roll, and requires smart play against everyone besides warrior who I just demolish.
---
Yes. It's number one as of now in the meta. Way stronger than it should be
---
This is so far from being the worst brawl. I think it's a pretty decent middle of the road one.
---
Exactly
---
I always hated Control warrior because the strength of their removal.
---
I recognize too well the impact that Warpath has on any given meta. How Brawl acts as a fail safe against big board.
---
RUST RAGER
---
3-MANA 5/1

Done
---
OH YEAH. SHE'S PRETTY GOOD. PRETTY GOOD AT GETTING PEOPLE TO QUIT WILD AMIRITE?!
---
Probably because it's either that or be homeless for him at this point.
---
For getting started if dont have them id defnitly get baku and genn, they got some of best decks ingame(odd pally,odd rogue,even shaman) that are pretty cheap. Get the old adventures like naxx,league etc, they got some of best cards(id go got league and naxx first escpially league due reno and brann) but all are worth getting.
---
Many cards of there are staples  or really good to use(creeper,reno,brann,loatheb) and even something like Kelthuzad while isnt optimal is alright if you dont got some of other big drops for something like big rogue/priest/shaman.
---
Id aslo get patches since its realy a aggro staple,(aggro druid,odd pally and odd rogue all use ) and its one of best cards ingame in general and defnitly something youl need if you wanna play aggro.
---
And for starting out id certainly recomend a cheap aggro deck(easy via baku and genn) or like mech hunter which can win really fast and costs less then a legendary to craft from nothing.
---
Id look at r/wildhearthstone (just dont pay to much attention to big priest complaint threats and look for guides and ask for advice if need it. and Viscous Syndacite wild reports(once a month or so average)
---
that allows you to get cards you want and then id get the staples from each class. (looking as wild reports and Wild heatrhstone reddit can give you good idea and  on wild subreddit can ask for what should craft first (outside baku and genn)
---
Oh one of these posts again
---
[Here we go again](https://i.imgur.com/BHzRF0U.gifv)
---
It's at a loss every single time, though.  The only way to generate any value on MTGO is to 3-0 drafts or events, which statistically only 1 in 8 people are going to do no matter which way you slice it.
---
I seriously prefer hearthstone's thing where I can disenchant cards for other cards rather than trading with bots at a similar exchange rate (generally 25-50% of a cards value).  Needing tickets for both cards AND events felt like I was constantly shoveling money into a fire to play.
---
I would rather a collection stay "valueless" for selling and be much, much cheaper to obtain.  I think the popularity of HS and MTGA probably backs up that preference as not just me being crazy
---
you have 0 clue about security.  Stop humiliating yourself being ignorant.

---
Yes. Many people don't get that ability words are near-meaningless pieces of text that only exist to connect similar, but not identical, mechanics within a set or block, so they think that random individual cards from other sets should have them.
---
MtG is a established IP of course it's doing fine, already has a fan base... No Dota players aren't a fan base for Artifact and that miscalculation killed Artifact.
---
On a side note, is anyone still experiencing the quest bug where you cant hold more than 2 quests?
---
I apologize if the post is redundant.  I just wanted to spread the word to people who enjoy CCG/TCG and this seemed like a logical subreddit to post it.  I won't be posting it again.
---
Are you dusting during rotations? I spent $20 on Dalaran and another $20 on that sale and that's about it. I still have 10,000 dust left from the rotation and quite a few tier 1 / tier 2 decks.
---
I may be wrong here but I think there is a minor difference for "repeatable this turn"  Each time it's cast it counts as an individual spell.  So if you were to play the shaman legendary that returns all spells cast to your hand you would receive duplicates of the "repeatable this turn" spell.  Where as with echo, it would only return one copy.
---
Not sure how it interacts with counterspell though?  If Witch's Brew is hit with a counterspell, can it still be repeated after?
---
Dr. Boom is hot trash in Wild compared to other Death Knights
---
i wouldn’t be surprised if it was HOFed. it’s very similar in function to ice block
---
Priest is the most boring to me. It always relied on DS + IF combo. (except dragon priest and spiteful). It is soooo boring for me. Also I don't like anduin.
---
Let's give them a hero power option too just so we cover all the bases.
---
I'm not sure if I'm understanding your question correctly, but the technology that Ethereum uses creates a "digital ledger" thru a blockchain that allows ownership to be verifiable and immutable.  So the buying and selling of cards between users, without a middle man, is much safer and smoother.
---
Whenever i see him i just go „oooh fuck no“ and as you said not because i am losing too much to it, it just takes so long most if the time
---
The game is in a different place. 
---
They (seem to) have a design philosophy that more choice is better. So they want to give players the ability to generate more cards as they play the game (psuedo card draw). They balance this out by making most of these cards RNG-based. 
---
So, it's a trade-off. We get more choices during the course of a game (which IS good). We get games that can be wildly different from each other (even though we play the same deck). And we get less polarized match-ups because of the wild swings these RNG effects can induce.
---
But, there is also the downside that you touch on. You can't really "play around" anything as the opponent to these RNG cards and you don't feel as satisfied with a win when you got lucky and high-rolled into generating 3 AOE's against an aggro/token deck.
---
When it's a random deck brawl like is, and specified as wild, does that mean every collectible card is potentially in your deck? (Subject to classes of course)
---
Are the decks subject to limit of 2 per card / 1 per legendary, or could potentially have more (albeit highly unlikely of course)?
---
Seconded.
---
I appreciate the amount of thought that goes into choosing the weekly brawl.
---
Man people act like rotations are literally just throwing your cards away lol
---
No. statistical evidence only shows to what people are playing. It doesn't account for every undiscovered list.
---
Statistically Control Shaman was bad. Yet last expansion I stomped both Warrior and Mages with it
---
This tavern brawl would be great with the burndown effect!
---
Whenever you lose to your opponents rng bull, you get the deck and over time a meta developed. Just need a way to generate new decks outside of the first time you play
---
That's the same thing I'm referring to, just probably worded better lol.
---
I think you don't understand.
---
Repeatable this turn was printed in Rise of Shadows. That's another Standard year. It will NOT rotate out at the same time as Echo cards.
---
SN1P-SN4P was printed as a part of Boomsday Project expansion. It's the same Standard year as Witchwood every Echo card will rotate out at the same time.
---
The idea was that Witch's Brew would be only Echo card left in Standard after rotation and new players would need to learn a new keyword just for a single card. Instead of making things easier, it would make things harder.
---
If they decided to make Echo an evergreen keyword that would come up pretty much every set (like they did with Rush or Lifesteal for example), then it would make sense to keep the keyword around. But if they will print maybe 1 or 2 Echo cards per year, then there's no reason to keep them keyworded. That's a good and clean design decision IMO. 
---
And ultimately, does it really matter that much? Why do people have to get angry about anything? The outrage around dropping Echo was incredibly disproportional to the importance of that decision.
---
I had a lot of fun with the brawliseum! I mean I have only 1 competitive deck but I won 150+ gold every run; it's nice if you want to have a sneak peak on the meta without going in ranked :D
---
I think there is a balance between pure random and allowing for player-choice to control that. I feel like Raven Idol hits that balance pretty well, but I do get that in a basic queue it can make the matches feel pretty long. Something I'll consider in the future, I still wouldn't say that one is soft-retired.
---
Highlander hunter is a blast
---
So..... what would you do about it then!?!?
---
I was at 22 hp, remembered I wanted to moonfire my face for BM(Warriors deserve it) but realised I'd die lmao close call
---
Thirded
---
Emotes aren't even necessary in the game, they're mostly just used by the immature/trolling players who want to BM their opponents. They serve little other purposes.
---
You're right. A deck that plays on curve and smashes face every turn unless there's an obvious value trade that you'll get punished for not taking is very simple. Which also happens to describe 99% of arena decks.
---
And you’d get to keep the card while getting 1600 dust. Seems much better to me
---
Cenarius is easily the worst card in that deck.
---
It depends man.
---
If youre competitive, a decent deck takes long.
---
If you just want to play the game because you think it's fun then a decent deck comes alot quicker since a lot of cards have craze random effect that *could* produce fun effects.
---
But yea, I would say the best way to get packs is to buy them but if you're f2p like me just survive on the daily quests. I've been playing for a couple of years and your collection does grow quite quickly.
---
As soon as you got 1 random Ice block as quest mage your chances of winning must of gone up by like 25%.
---
It is a keyword.
---
I don’t think there’s a card you could remove from a class that would have a bigger impact than divine spirit. Priest is literally the divine spirit class - that’s their only strategy and every deck revolves around cheesing out a giant minion to smorc you with. Glad it’s in the classic set so we have to deal with it in every meta until the end of time.
---
I don’t know why but this feels written in the style of fanfiction
---
This and the Elise/Hunting Party copying inconsistency are the worst parts of the deck. Fixing these issues would make the deck so much smoother to play.
---
Thank god
---
Risking dying the turn you play it is fair for the insane plays you can pull off after it. A higher cost also means it's far more likely for it to be drawn by the time you have enough mana to actually play it, it feels a lot less high rolly for someone to play it on curve on turn 6/7 than to play it 5 or coin it out 4, where slower decks or opponents with bad draw might not even have the board to punish the 'wasted' turn. Not arguing it should go back to 7 cost, but 5 is too low.
---
This.
---
In fact there is a whole scale on how likely a keyword is to come back (with "storm" being impossible).
---
https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Storm_Scale
---
&gt; I doubt they'd ever consider making a second client. 
---
Why do you doubt this? 
---
Much more expensive games than HS have been overhauled. Ever heard of Final Fantasy XIV? Rebuilt from the ground up because players decided that it sucked and the devs decided they had no choice but to agree with the players. 
---
The "only" thing that currently stops Blizzard from shelling out on a brand new client for HS is insufficient demand from the playerbase. If the demand was more widespread and higher pitch (and it's getting there, on both counts) and risked tanking both HS and Blizzard's PR cross-franchise, then they would make it happen on a fucking dime. 
---
Hearthstone is one of the most profitable video games of all time. There's no end to the number of features they could add and still be turning a profit. But they (meaning corporate) think the short term gains outweigh the PR shitstorm. They think this every time. It's in the consumers' best interest - and totally within their power - to prove Activision corporate wrong. But you don't do that by saying "the devs can't do any better, we have to put up with the game exactly as it is."
---
can you share your list? I love quest dudu too!
---
Not sure why he wouldn’t just run a Mechathun package for exactly that reason
---
Can we semi-retire this one?
---
lol
---
Warlock for me. I never enjoyed Zoo and I never enjoyed super late game control or combo, and Warlock decks felt like they tended to fall into one of those categories. Every other class has had decks at some point since I've been playing a few years ago that are more my speed.
---
&gt; This will cost a lot of time/money which Blizzard, apparently, doesn't think is worth the investment.
---
You understand, of course, that what Blizzard thinks is worth the investment changes directly based on any PR shitstorms that may or may not be brewing, yes?
---
Basically control warrior can only clear your board so many times. After that, they’re at you’re mercy. Most decks they can handle easily, but mages and quest Paladin are different. Quest Paladin basically floods the board with minions that you have to clear twice. And they can do it over and over and over and over and over etc. it’s just infinite value.
---
Thanks! I'm actually having a hard time with deck building on HP because it seems like anything that anything older than Witchwood is in Wild, which can't be used in solo deck building? Maybe I'm missing something? I have plenty of cards I can't select from the deck building window.
---
I wonder what the fuck was on their minds when they decided to print Yogg Box, honestly. 
---
A way more consistent Yogg-Saron that can be easily cast four times in a single game for at least half of its mana cost for the class that already has a board full of giants and all of their other minions costing 1 by the end of turn 5. Yep, seems like a good idea.
---
Tons of Quest Druid lists don’t run him. Not necessary for the deck at all so don’t feel too bad
---
But never disenchant your classic class legendaries! They’ve all seen play at one point or another
---
sounds like a fun deck lol. But doesn't control warrior have like 20 removal cards? Sounds wild that all that isn't enough for quest paladin.
---
It does if you wanna outvalue Warriors.
---
he got "Disneyficated"
---
Lol secret mage isnt even a great deck in wild, but whatever you need to tell yourself to get by buddy
---
Secret mage is like...tier 2? Maybe even tier 3 last I checked?
---
Wut.  I thought they stopped giving the legendary after a certain date.  They stopped giving out Vargoth in July didnt they?
---
He should’ve played around it
---
Alternately, the devs' communication is based on the philosophy of whoever is in charge of each team. Jeff has a widespread reputation for having principles and the balls to fight for them. Not every dev is like that. Not every dev would inspire their team to have the same attitude.
---
Warrior has 2x brawl, 2x warpath, and someone’s 1x supercollider and 1x plague cars that destroys damaged minions. The thing is they usually have to use most of these on your board flooded with smaller minions or they die. So if they use 1 brawl, you’re good to go because they usually don’t have second brawl. Warpath can’t kill what eggs spawn, and after they run out of those 4 main board clears, they’re down to single target removal which doesn’t next to nothing against a bunch of eggs that spawn 8/8s over and over
---
OH MY GOD CONTROL WARRIOR IS NOT THR BEST DECK?! Reddit was wrong all the way. Pog
---
Have you seen what cards it got in Saviors of Uldum? https://hsreplay.net/decks/#gameType=RANKED_WILD&amp;sortBy=winrate
---
Currently the highest winrate wild deck according to hsreplay.
---
It'd be better if it was a keyword since there is possesed lackey which does not benefit from Lackey effects.
---
How do I chat with people?
---
They have to add you or you add them
---
This. Lackeys are built for tempo. I usually hoard the kobolds in hand, like you said, but I save them for trades and tempo, not face.
---
It doesn't work if it's not the first week of the expansion. Even if you are the best player in the world you will not have a winrate above like 60 or 65% with a standart deck. It's nearly impossible to earn gold from this mode if everyone is playing decent decks and everyone would if this was a permanent mode.
---
No.  
---
Boom is the problem, Devastator is a symptom.  
---
If you played Devastator at 10 and didn't also have rush and the ability to discover more I wouldn't have as much of a problem with it.  
---
If there was another card in the deck more of a problem than devastator then it's omega assembly as that completely fixes one of the supposed downfalls of a control warrior which should be card generation.  
---
Still even that card isn't as bad if Boom isn't giving rush and they just generated 3 minion clears without having to dip into their actual deck resources.
---
Why would you add someone who you're salty at I wonder?
---
Hi, I think I have your order over here.
---
I’ve done this too. After he coined boom on 6 I just roped every turn before sending 7 8/8s his way
---
You're welcome and good luck!  I generally don't value scavenging hyena too much.  I almost always tempo him out instead of holding him for the perfect opportunity to make it huge. 90% of the time he is there to absorb some premium removal.
---
Overpriced, should give **Charge** at least...
---
U killed 7
---
Pussy
---
The games are a bit more random with all of the card generation options currently seeing play. But I am having a blast playing Highlander decks in the new meta.
---
I strongly suspect it’s less than 100% random. Without millions of data points, it’s extremely hard to say, and while a 5-10% adjustment is hard to prove statistically, Blizzard stands to gain a lot from that.
---
What. No, you literally mulliganed for that card in every single Hunter deck except Deathrattle. Then played it on 6 or 5 with the coin, and would beat Odd Warrior 100% of the time. You were pumping out something like \~8 mana threats every single turn for the rest of the game; except they would cost you like 7 mana with the hero power because the Zombeasts were better than a collectible card.  
---
Excluding even the high-rolls like Scalehide, Rhino, Cave Hydra, Stranglethorn Tiger... you were still getting ridiculous amounts of value even on average zombeasts. Hell, you could fatigue the Odd Warrior with Raptor Hatchlings.  
---
Deathstalker is the single best hero card in the game, and it's not particularly close. Dr.Boom is probably the third worst after Thrall and Garrosh. He has no place in Wild really, he doesn't help Odd Warrior with any of it's problems.
---
I’ve still never pulled a Murloc Warleader. 😞
---
Cards don't rotate to wild, standard rotates through expansions. Wild is the default state.
---
Dr. Boom clearly is an issue. His battlecry provides an infinite source of removal for the class that already has the most premium removal in the standard format, which makes them not have to sacrifice being ridiculously powerful anti aggro to have an unbeatable late game.
---
Devastator shouldn't be a mech too, but Omega Assembly would barely be a problem if  generated mechs didn't have rush.
---
Dear Blizzard: Please stop giving us Classic packs
---
I know. I’m just a shithead
---
this is a shit rng cardgame, nobody wants to hear your "well played" after losing, this isnt real life.

Actually not even once. I played Quest Shaman almost a dozen times. Aggro Warrior twice. Phaoris Mage once.
---
The real question is, how long can this go on?
---
The weapon says after you summon a minion, so the battlecry resolves, then the weapon triggers.
---
Can i get the difference explained
---
I dont think so because usually battlcry effects trigger before the minion is "technically " summoned ,like how minions that damage the entire board dont hurt themselves,wnd because the weapon says "after you PLAY a minion it should only effect the first one because the copy is summoned not played
---
Thanks, Blizzard.
---
Oh well. Good luck with the quest :)
---
I don’t respect anyone who plays control warrior, unless MAYBE they’ve been facing aggro all day. But some people just play control warrior all day for a month. Couldn’t be me.
---
Calm down lol
---
That minion was summoned not played.
---
A big problem with this card is giving all mechs rush. Change his battlecry.
---
Kripp doesn't even use Kripp as his name
---
7 or more wins is guaranteed to reward at least 150 gold. Because of how rewards are distributed (more extra gold from a 9-win run than the penalty for a 5-win run), you need to average a bit less than that (~6-6.5) to stay gold neutral with arena indefinitely without quest rewards.
---
Do you have a decklist? That sounds cool. I've been playing some games on rank 4 with it, but I'e only managed to obtain a 48-50% winrate with it due to losing to the mages and some aggro.
---
Though I've only got a small sample size of 12 games I'm feeling the lack of anti-aggro tech.
---
Priest and Warrior. I liked Patron warrior and haven’t played the class since. Priest I have always hated and probably will always DE their cards as soon as I get any. Just never been a fan.
---
Randomly priest is the only class I never got to max level in WoW
---
Yeah that’s what I was thinking. Must be a clone
---
I win pretty regularly against Control Warrior...

Be honest, it takes luck, skill and grinding to make legend. You know it and I know it
---
I am throughly convinced
---
What is it?
---
Thanks for the advice and the link, this helps a lot. I think I was pretty lucky with the first 2 drafts because I'm pretty bad with playing slower heroes, haha. RIP Rogue.
---
wild population is creeps only, beware
---
and how i get 1 gig with my slow very fucking slow cnx i mean 512 Kbs in 30 seconds???
---
It's not on the card as a keyword on the actual lackies
---
What would be the highest on a Hearthstone Storm Scale? Recruit, maybe?
---
Remember when hearthstone was good
---
Least fave to play is probably Shaman, and least fave to play against is 100% mage. Between secret mage where I can’t play my cards because Explosive Runes and Counterspell are a thing, and Qiest Mage where I have lost games to Time Warp + Arcane Giants on goddamn turn 5, as well as getting multiple ice blocks from random generation effects just makes me think the entire class is bullshit
---
Thanks so much for recommending the videos! The videos are pretty helpful because I was definitely playing Mages and slower decks wrong. Also, the links from the "Hearthstone Beginners Guide: Year of the Dragon" were much appreciated: I have a lot more content to read over.
---
It will be enough for about 70-80 packs if you are not going to buy adventure in the meantime. What you will be able to build from that depends mostly on pack rng. In the long run it works for me and I always have meta deck - but I keep all cards, look for cheapest option for non golden class that I can build from what I already have. For example for current meta I could build control warrior for about 4k dust (crafting dr boom, Elysiana, 2 epics) i got the rest from the packs. I have it already golden, so I'm not going to build it, instead it will be combo priest for 1.6 dust or I will rebuild my cyclone mage from previous meta into new meta mage for x dust.
---
Because I've tried it multiple times and still sometimes play it because Reno decks are my favorite and the current standard ones aren't that interesting?
---
Wrote that before reading your last paragraph. Holy shit, you're dumb as rocks.
---
Let me disenchant cthun blizzard, i don’t play wild and i want the 400 dust!!
---
I was with you until the Dr. Boom nerfs. Warrior doesn't have a good hero card in wild. Nerfing Dr. Boom removes its already slim viability in wild
---
Autochess is great
---
I’ve universally hated playing against Rouge. And recently, control warrior, it’s no battle back and forth, it’s just removal every damn turn and bombs
---
Starting to save now is the best way indeed. I am at 1300 gold already, because of some generous friends (80g quest) and good outcomes of the brawl. 
---
I usually save ~10k each 4 months.
---
Can’t make this shit up, I honestly thought it said copy your opponent’s homework.. god dammit copy homework memes are taking over me
---
to make it zAnY and wAcKy
---
Oh shit, Mr. Badass Toughguy here.  I don't give a rat's ass what happens in other games.  I just want to be able to pre-block dickwads like you.

Kind of interesting they put Combo Priest as low Tier 2 when HSReplay stats have it as closer to a top Tier 2 deck. And some players on competitivehs are predicting it is indeed either a Tier 1 or high Tier 2 deck, sporting very high winrates.
---
Blizzard deserve that spit to their face.
---
Likewise, not everyone gets C'Thun.
---
No other card works that way. Keywords are not tribes.
---
If c Thun wasn't free then you would literally be pulling bloodfen raptors and crocolists from packs and that feels bad
---
Yeah. C'Thun was viable enough to drown out the main archetype for normal builds too at the time. The current quests kind of require you to build the whole thing with it in mind. 7 cards for Cthun wasnt too much....hell in Priest you could not run the Heal 10 Hp to hero one. Warlock didn't need their specific one either.
---
&gt;Grind is subjective your right about that.
---
What? No. That's not what I'm saying.
---
Do you consider 50 games a month a grind? What about 100?
---
&gt;But luck and skill is something I think everyone needs to get there.
---
Do you really think people who get there with a 70% winrate needed luck? What about 60%?
---
There are absolutely garbage cards that are fine to disenchant if I  got cenarius even before this quest came along I wouldn’t disenchant it
---
Ask your ISK or some shit I don’t know, I watched the launcher say “1.something gigs remaining”.
---
no, i still win, every quest paladin plays Truesilver and i don’t care about concentration
---
im playing the list from zetalot with Butterhead, wich is pretty nuts in that matchup

I didn’t see a single spellbreaker yet
