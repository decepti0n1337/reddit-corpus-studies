Considering kft was 5 expansions ago and rush was added 3 expansions ago I’m impressed it made the 4 most recent

---
Also -- there's no reason you can't use Old Murk-Eye + Windfury + Sapphire Spellstone in wild. Don't make things any harder on yourself than they need to be.

I had to craft both, but I SO DID.

On the topic of Leeroy being nerfed, may I remond everyone of the reason for the nerf?
---
“Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. We like having a variety of deck types but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not very fun or interactive."
---
Considering how many OTK decks we have now, this seems like pretty obsolete reasoning. I mean, this is 20+ damage, compared to 50 with Shirvallah, instant win with Mecha’thun, RIP in peace Shudderwock with however many damage it had, etc.
---
Consistently inconsistent
---
I think it's also a matter of *design space* ^^^TM  since charge always has been a combo enabler. Let alone designing the current priest cards has borderline backfired because Stonetusk boar has enabled infinite damage APM priest.
---
What surprised me a whole lot as well was the introduction of Mecha C'thun. If anything, that is the least interactive win condition we have seen yet. And I should add, it's not exactly meme tier, as dog has reached rank 1 with it literally 10 minutes ago.
---
Slamming Barnes on 4 feels way less interactive and way more frustrating than leeroy. 
---
But individual packs of the other sets one at a time until you get the guaranteed legendaries from each one one. After that, I'd recommend saving up for the next expansion and buying as many packs as you can afford day one.
---
Leroy is so boaring...
---
Are we talking about standard or wild here?
---
Rush is just a worse Charge.
---
It's what the developers wanted Charge to be by realized it was too late in the games lifespan to make it so. So they made Rush.
---
sure high rolls can suck but i am ok with it. i just feel like this secret is is balanced and i am ok with most results. yes i know what ER gonna do but it is pretty op and there is nothing you can do. play small minion, you die. play big minion you just spend your turn doing nothing. that's just how i feel.
---
&gt;non-Zoo Warlocks
---
You haven't demonstrated that the polarity problem is unique to Aggro Mage.  Decks have good matchups, and this is not inherently a problem.
---
&gt; top half of the most polarizing decks
---
Above it were Odd Warrior, Quest Rogue, Tog Druid, and Control Lock.  Only one of these other decks was directly nerfed, making your point seem weak.
---
&gt;Druid fell out of the top tier after that round of nerfs.
---
Druid wasn't T1 when it was nerfed in RKR.  It needed a nerf regardless, and did during Boomsday.  Boomsday was one of the most miserable metas thanks in part to the presence of Druid.
---
&gt;And both the nerfs to Mana Wyrm you suggested would not have been enough.
---
This is conjecture on your part; I think they would have been enough.  I think the nerf they chose was overkill on an epic scale.
---
&gt; The design process is clear
---
As I see it, there were strictly better alternatives to the path they chose.  The Mana Wyrm nerf was random and badly done, and obviously so.  Thus, I cannot understand why they thought it was a *good idea* to nerf Mana Wyrm in the way that they did, at the time they did.  That part is opaque to me.
---
I always wondered how charge in magic (haste) was balanced and in HS horribly op. After getting into it again recently it's obvious because of interactability on opponents turns.
---
Guess Team5 accepted the fact that charge can't be balanced in a way that it won't cockblock future card designes.
---

I FUCKING LOVE HEARTHSTONE. Now there's nothing wrong with complaining about things that you can see need to be improved but I'd hate to see all this negativity affect the game. This may seem extreme but negativity among a player base really can lead to the downfall of a game. 
---
I have never understood how people claim there is no skill. How do you explain the same top players doing well all the time and YOU can't even get to legend?  
---
It's been at least since the rumble patch maybe even hallowween.

Pretty clear Blizzard doesn't care about minor bugs.

Everyone hates Barnes but he is in wild and there is equal bullshit level cards there as well

divine00#1671 NA 80g trade
---
you go 1st
---
that's one way to completely dismiss reality.
---
Power Overwhelming was HoF'd because of its interaction with Leeroy so clearly the devs are balancing the game with him in mind.  
---
Aggro Shaman didn't even use Leeroy. Their class cards were so busted they didn't need him. Sure Odd Rogue and Odd Paladin are strong decks atm but they're not broken. It's fine for aggro to have a neutral finisher IMO. 
---
Silence #22350 EU 80G you go first :)
---
Don’t forget to do the (i think just first?) set of the Frozen Throne single player so you get your free deathknight.

Good God I thought you were kidding. Half the people on there are complaining about the game dying the other half are calling people "fucking morons".
---
That subreddit was possibly the most reddit-y thing I think I've seen.
---
what? forsenE
---
This guy is a complete moron.
---
He’s not wrong
---
Yeah that's good. 
---
I feel like rush is a much more fun mechanic than charge.
---
The average suggest a trend. A trend is ongoing so when this supposed tier 1 paladin deck is no longer in favor, then all of a sudden, what are these new players going to play? A trend gives you foresight into future troubles. It may be okay for now bc odd pally exist, but there can very well not be a cheap option next rotation.
---
And FYI, I don't really care about other players plight for meta decks... I've already commented that I spend money so... telling me that all these cheap options for odd pally and resource collection as f2p doesn't really affect me... the power creep still exist... and what it does is limit the variety people can enjoy... and that's an issue that affects both and me and you. 
---
Keep in mind you’re guaranteed a legendary in your first 10 packs of any set.
---
You ok?
---
Fuck Priest. 
---
Cool thank you!
---
Card game.
---
Well, funded by myself for a couple of more months, but the scope is not impossible, so I'm hoping to finish by the time I need to worry about money, and go back to normal software developement :). So a hug is enough for now, as a kickstarter :D.
---
The last 2 expansions have produced very few fun new decks, and the only new interesting deck I liked (Undatakah Druid) is unplayable because of the nerfs. Hunter is also the least fun class to play against and it makes up 30% of the ladder.

Rush didn't kill charge... the cube did.
---
Should have played around it
---
\*shrug\* This is why I play a deck that goes off turn 4. :P
---
&gt;I have read some places that every so many months cards become unusable
---
There's a 2-year rotation. On the first expansion each year (around April), the three oldest expansions leave standard and their packs are no longer available from the shop or from arena rewards. So an expansion can stay in standard from 16 to 24 months and there are 4 to 6 expansions in standard at any given time. The next expansions to leave are Un'goro, Frozen Throne, and Kobolds. Cards from expansions that have rotated out (including adventures that never came with card packs) can still be crafted for the usual dust price.
---
&gt;so I was wondering if I should start pulling Kobolds and Catacombs for that legendary or save the gold I get for the following time.
---
It depends mostly on whether you plan to play wild. (Note that some tavern brawls are wild.) In my experience, casual play can net you between 5000 and 10000 gold between expansions (that is, every 4 months), so if you don't play arena, you have the option to buy between 50 and 100 packs per expansion cycle. Moreover, the three older expansions currently in standard are generally agreed to have a higher overall power level than the three newer expansions, so if you plan to play wild at all, it'd be a good idea to get some of those packs while you can- at least enough to get that first legendary. But with that being said, if you run short on gold, consider stopping if you get a legendary or an epic, in order not to waste your pity timers.
---
I C Bajs
---
Also works with zilliax, dont have to run the skaterbot. And can be used as a sort of reno in a pinch with just glinda, mechwarper, and zilliax taking up only 9 mana, no emperor required. Looks fun.
---
Lucky you, I only had the dust for one, so I crafted Rag. Still don't have Sylvanas, but I do have a golden Leeroy so if they dust that it's a great day for me.
---
I was going to comment exactly this. The fact that it's the most upvoted comment shows one thing... Reddit will be Reddit
---
Bruh, even BM'd. But this is kinda the reason I would never play HS on a touch device, too risky to make mistakes.
---
Lucky? I had to rip away at my collection of bad golden epics to do it, my man.
---
Cold light shouldn't have been rotated rip. 
---
My favorite reviews (in general) are the "Never played it, looks dumb. 1 Star"
---
You haven't hit on the point that bums me out the most and that's that the game is essentially the same as it was 4 years ago.  I realized about a month ago that I liked Hearthstone because of it's potential, because of all the game modes that could be added and the ways in which design space could be expanded.  Then I realized that I've thought that way for years and that Hearthstone will never realize that potential.  I'm over it.  It'll always be the same game and the lack of true counter play means it will also always be a game of high/low rolls.  I say this as someone who has been playing since beta and is finally putting the game down for good.  I have a buyer for my account and I couldn't be happier.
---
The game's expensive enough. I would not mind a "neutral class" with a hero card that changes your power at start and again when played, possibly with some synergistic cards that add spells and possibly weapons to your hand
---
Hey, I guess I'm not being clear...Baku or Gen cost 1600 dust to craft...seems expensive.
---
The problem with Kobolds is that it's rotating in April, so all of the packs of that set that you'll buy will be useless by then (in Standard at least). Rastakhan will stay around until 2020 so it's a lot safer to buy packs from that set instead.
---
There's already enough balance challenges with just nine classes. Even Magic: The Gathering often has trouble with just five colors, the closest analogue to classes in that game.
---
Of course, I would probably play them assuming they're interesting enough, but with the Death Knight cycle of Hero cards, it's probably better for the other classes be added to Hearthstone in that way instead of full on creating a new class.
---
Ohh yeah I don't think I dusted anything to craft Rag. Even with the dust refund from Rag it still wasn't worth it overall to me. Still, Sylv is on my shortlist of legendaries to craft...
---
Nine classes already stretches them thin, and there's a lot of problems with adding enough support for a completely new class. But I'm sure we'll get a Monk-themed expansion similar to Knights of the Frozen Throne.
---
YoU kNoW tHe MaP NaMeS wtf neeeerd
---
&gt;(3) The legend meta is far more diverse than the "all levels" or "rank 4 to 1" meta, meaning - the best players play more decks, better, than all of us. So what are we complaining about? You complain because YOU can't beat druid, not because druid can't be beat. You complain because YOU can't beat hunter, not because hunter can't be beat.
---
I mean, you'd have to not make legend often to actually think this.
---
I'd say that about 80% of my friends and myself just fuck around once we hit legend.
---
But..but..you don't have Anduin or Shadowform to activate Janalai. Guess it never went as planned eh?
---
“Battlecry: Can’t attack heroes this turn” is essentially rush unless you put it on the battlefield without triggering battlecry. 
---
Funny that Wrathguy is best when you can gift it away.
---
Yeah, "empty your deck, play this card and kill it". Bam, all done. 
---
Yes, there are counters such as Weasel Priest, but THAT is a meme deck.

Personally I really dislike Uther too. Sure, there's a lot more going on there, but it's still almost a literal Exodia.

---
Why does purify bother people? If you think it's a bad card, then don't use.
---
&gt;On top of all of this, you are paying 300+ dollars per expansion or you are grinding mundane quests every day like it's a choir.
---
$300 per expansion? Why on earth would you need to spend that much? I'm F2P and I end up on rank 5 or lower every season.
---
Ive got the 3 hour hakkar deck so ill show you in a couple days of trying
---
People say this like it's free dust with no downside. Yeah you can craft a new legendary, but you also just had a legendary that has been in multiple top decks every single meta removed from your Standard collection. Not many legendaries are as ubiquitous as Leeroy, Rag, Sylvanas, the legendary you craft with that dust likely won't leave you with as many top decks/cut your hypothetical future spending down. Now you need to craft the rest of whatever new decks you'll be playing instead, whatever the new finisher is for Miracle/Odd Pally/etc...
---
/remindme 1 week
---
If you want to play odd warrior but are worried about the rotation, non-quest odd warrior (with Dr. Boom and dragons) has virtually no Mammoth cards, except for Reckless Flurry.
---
I have to say I disagree. The ceiling can be quite high, if you watch how differently you might see a pro play a deck than even like rank 5 players. Stuff like APM and Clone Priest are quite tough to play yet really good players can get quite a high win rate from them.
---
[[Shadow Word: Death]] is still a Basic, so you still need to watch out for it.
---
How does armorsteal sound at all like it's piercing? OP pretty clearly meant stuff like Alley Armorsmith.

And as of now it's a card that has little to jo downside. I mean yea, pierce would absolutely destroy that card, but no counter at all sucks too. 
---
I wasn't talking about anti-armor cards.
---
I was jokingly extrapolating armersteal from lifesteal like with Alley Armorsmith. There is no need to create armersteal as it would be broken in any class but warrior or maybe hunter and serve no purpose other than to kill neutral lifesteal.
---
You know, if you're not going to read my posts ("I only read your TLDR") and then give only vague, contradictory responses ("Mage's polarity was a problem, but Warrior's was not"), I don't think you're in a position to say who is and is not willing to work with facts, and who is believing only what they want to believe.

---
I'm somewhat new, played for 2 or 3 seasons now and ended up at rank 2 the last two seasons with a simple F2P secret hunter deck. This month it feels so much harder to climb past rank 5 at all, I guess it's because the meta has adjusted to hunters? Anyone else have that problem? I'm thinking whether I should try to upgrade this deck or get a different one, but I want to stay F2P.
---
I didn't really hit any legendaries that would allow me to easily build a T1/T2 deck outside of hunter, also don't have Zuljin or Subject9. I have about 2200 dust. Could craft a second masters call + scavenging hyenas and run a beast hunter too, does anyone have experience with that deck at rank 5-legend? The other idea would be to basically just run with the deck as is and save all the dust for rotation.

I find wargear better because I can get more damage faster, and since I have 2 wargears, I can play them outside of the combo piece, and they’re stronger than a replicating menace, and I don’t think I have replicating menace
---
Seriously? Leeroy is not in EVERY “aggro” deck. IMHO, leeroy is extremely balanced. There are a handful of other cards that deal 4-6 damage for 5 OR LESS. You wanna call out leeroy, you better call out every single other card thats as efficient per mana cost. I’ll wait. 
---
Then tell me, whats defined as aggro if not by the fast wins? Big board? Spellstone hunter would be considered aggro then. Low cost minions? Guess mechathun lock and otk priests are aggro. 
---
Diamond spellstone specifies "different" friendly minions that died this game. It will never summon duplicates. As a counter example see twilight's call that just specifies 2 minions that died this game and can summon duplicates. 
---
What's the point of a classic set if they just keep HoF'ing all the cards?
---
It doesn't really need a downside though. It's upside is good but marginal. 
---
I was talking about having to dust other cards to craft them. Using golden epics as an example (since that's what the guy above me said he dusted), you'd have to dust 4 golden epics for 400 apiece, craft Sylvanas, then wait for your 1600 dust refund. However, golden epics are 1600 apiece to craft. I mean yeah you could in that specific case craft the same epics in non golden but it's still a downgrade to someone like me who really enjoys the aspect of collecting and watching my collection grow.

You must be new. Renolock used to use Leeroy PO and faceless with a thaurissan proc as a finisher. If renolock is an aggro deck idk what to say
---
Sounds balanced to me.
---
That is...a major change .\_."
---
Kingsbane Rogue sure looking weird these days.
---
To be fair, it was one of the better Inspire cards. 
---
My issues with Hearthstone have nothing to do with anything you have mentioned.
---
I am irritated with Hearthstone because the devs have shown that they are completely unwilling to innovate or change the game in any meaningful way (expansions with new cards do not count, they are the bare minimum required to keep a CCG alive).  Activision is not interested in trying anything new or adding new features or modes, all they want to do is crap out another expansion to sell once every 4 months.
---
Where are the new game modes?  New features?  QoL improvements?  Is there a random cardback feature?  Can I play my Arena decks against my friend's just for fun?  No plans for any tournament mode?  Any achievement system?  Cardback for making the Arena leader boards?  Multiplayer (more than 2) formats?  Can they fix the new card bug that has existed for now 5 years?  Can they make the game run smoothly and not stutter (doesn't matter if it is my top end gaming PC or a high end smartphone it runs equally crappy on all of them)?  Is there a new way to play limited?  An alternate Constructed format I could try during a Tavern Brawl, like Pauper, Peasant, or Singleton?  Speaking of Tavern Brawl can I play it more than 5 days a week?
---
The answer to all of these questions at this point is obviously a big "no and there are no plans to make that or anything like it".  They won't add new features or modes that don't make them money, and they won't fix bugs or performance issues unless they are absolutely game breaking.  And to be frank, I can hardly blame them.  They are just resting on their laurels, clearly the unchallenged king of digital CCGs and have no reason to change anything.   
---
But this lazy approach to the development of the game has led to me playing other games.  I've actually enjoyed Artifact despite its problems, and I've been playing a LOT of MTGA lately.  These games are still new, still struggling to carve out their market share, and still willing to implement and add new features and game modes.  I really enjoy Hearthstone, but I'm bored of it just being the same game for the last 5 years and this has lead me to play it less and less.         
---
Not really.
---
Hex proof is a straight up upgrade on shroud, rush is a straight up downgrade 
---
They stopped printing each keyword for different reasons.
---
There was no need for shroud cuz hex proof is what they would have wanted in the first place 
---
Whereas there's no more printing of charge effects cuz it was difficult to balance in a turn based in game like hs
---
Improvise.Adapt.Overcome
---
I mean Wild Even Shaman is a top deck currently, and I'd say that is midrange.
---
Since its battlecry didnt activate, its just stats. So like best 3 drop or what?
---
And on turn 2
---
F for your opponent.
---
Every other charge minion was nerfed or was SUPER bad because blizzard quickly realized charge SUCKS as a mechanic and its unfair to play against
---
How’s odd warrior treating you? 
---
There shouldn't be a classic set, it keeps the meta stale.
---
I agree wholeheartedly, the thing is the current meta has a lot of decks running 1 or 2 oozes. The swing is so substantial when your weapon is removed  that I find myself wondering what to do in certain situations. 
---
[[King Mukla]] [[Tar Creeper]] and [[Injured Blademaster]]

Midranger hunter exists because Rexxar lets it win (almost) every control matchup, which kind of makes it something else entirely.

There's also stone skin basilisk which is a 1/1 with both divine shield and poisonous, so he could very well kill two deathwings.

...you're pretty odd.
---
Just did it, thank you!
---
That's incredible!
---
Fungalmancer at least requires you to have a minion on board for a turn. And as of right now almost all weapons can't be multiplied (windfury, faceless, cube, blessed champion etc) to create an otk
---
Currently it's a 51.2/49.8 going first vs second, and it seems impractical and impossible to close such a small gap. 
---
yeah dude if youre gullible enough to crave wendys for a tweet i would hate that too.. focus your hate on more productive things dude
---
Infinite resources in a CCG is ALWAYS a bad idea.
---
Look up Recurring Nightmare + Palinchron (MTG). People laughed at me for doing it, but it turns out, I wasn't the only one who knew early that infinite mana and infinite creature recursion  every turn was broken as hell.
---
HS didnt need to relearn this the hard way. The lessons already existed. They just didn't bother studying CCG game design at all.
---
Yeah but why would you Southsea Deckhand + Cold Blood + Cold Blood on 3 versus a hunter, a class with both flanking strike and candleshot?

---
Common joke on the interwebs that has become so ubiquitous that it is probably seen more than just RIP.
---
Quest Baku warrior was amazing to me at the end of the boomsday meta.  Blackwald Pixie is a great addition.  If you finish the quest and your opponent has no minions up, you can hit their face with 20 damage in one go (3 for sulfuras, 2 for hero power, 3 for pixie, 2 more for hero power and hit face with your sword for 20).  
---
I’ve caught some opponents by surprise.  
---
It heavily limits design space.
---
Especially in the case of unit duplication and attack buffs, which can't be too strong or too cheap or else Leeroy just breaks the game with combos.
---
That's why Azure left; it forced every 5-cost card to be "Is this card better than card draw + a decently sized body?" and the answer to most of those ended up either being "no" or "yes, but it's oppressive/unfun."
---
I'd even say some version of this is likely. A few more sets as weak as Rumble, with"pros" screaming "dont pre order, weak set" and they will continue forcing new cards by making old ones worthless.
---
Azure Drake was the tip of the Slippery Slope. Rumble was, ironically, the beginning of the avalanche.
---
That would explain only big or powerful charge minions not being printed though. You don't use cube to duplicate low attack chargers like Stonetusk Boars or Stormwind Knights. Hell, no one used cube to duplicate chargers with less than 5 attack. I don't see how would cube prevent 1/2 charge from being printed.
---
And from ALL expansions before cube, there were 12 charge minions printed. 5 of them had it gated behind battlecry and some condition, not being usable for cube shenanigans. Another was Icehowl, which technically has charge in text, but practically it's a worse rush. That leaves 6 actual charge minions released over 14 expansions (3 of them in TGT, so only 4 out of 14 expansions released minions with unconditional charge). Out of those, only one of them has more than 4 attack and has been used with cube, Charged Devilsaur.
---
Explain me one thing.
---
How is the most likely 18-22 years old kid behind Wendy's social media account upsetting you so much?
---
What if its just the kids honest opinion that he likes Hearthstone and he wants to do a cool little crossover for those who both enjoy HS and Wendys? Do you think the guy got a few hundred bucks for that tag? I don't think so personally, but if you do tell me.
---
Then I'll step in as a 3rd party to say:
---
Fuck off.
---
Well you certainly didnt have many upvotes to spare on your other posts, thats unfortunate 
---
.80%
---
Hey that looks like a Pokémon I’m too lazy to look up
---
I just disagree with point (5) completely. First of all, just because i knew hunterstone was coming doesn't meant i wanted it. IIRC a lot of people wanted hunter to take a hit too (either to rexxar dk, spellstone or just cube in general).
---
secondly, if the definition of a healthy meta means every class is played equally (11-12% each), then 30% of the meta being hunter is huge! Obviously a completely equal class distribution would be near impossible to obtain but right now, Spell hunter ALONE makes up 12% of the game (according to vicious syndicate). I think that's a valid reason to be concerned/frustrated.
---
And lastly, the price of a deck shouldn't make it invulnerable to criticism and i don't think just because hunter decks being cheap makes it the most popular class. Control warlock, taunt druid, kazakus priest, cubelock and many more expensive decks were once the most played decks in a season. I think hunter's dominance play's a much more significant role than you think.
---
You say it like it's a bad thing.
---
I enjoy control and I enjoy combo just because these archetypes are struggling doesnt mean I shouldn’t be playing them, I was at rank 20 two months ago and I just hit Rank 9. The deck I played was Odd Dragon Warrior the whole way down. It wasn’t as good as other decks but it was fun, and that’s the point of that game. If your not playing it for fun, you should probably find something else to play. I have annoying moments and times when I just won’t play, but I always come back

That's a pretty poor argument. That's like saying if monarchies are so bad, why are most of the successful nations throughout history monarchic?
---
Not hating on the tweet in this thread because it's hilarious, but your argument just doesn't make sense.
---
I tried explaining the same thing to him. Don't bother with him, dudes up on his high horse 24/7 judging by his other threads.
---
"Criticism" - fancy word for complainers,
---
"Debatable"- admitting someone is right but allowing an ol'switcheroo "criticism" to be said right after
---
"Very debatable" - what you said is so true that ill add an adjective to give more more meaning to me reading someones intentions which are irrelevant to the debate
---
Your last paragraph mentions giving devs the benefit of the doubt cause evil corporation you're right.
---
This is fun!
---
It's 2019, and you're still unironically using NPC as an insult? C'mon man.
---
There's definitely humans in Wild but I gotta say, I've been matched up with the same group of people a LOT. Like as soon as I see the name, I practically know which decks they are running, and I'm not some high Legend who is seeing only the same guys at top 100.
---
preach, brother. Im so fed up with streamers doing so and act like its the end of the world.
---
Warhammer Champions is another game by the same company with a very similar playstyle (but more mature theme) that came out last year, would definitely recommend it and it was quite well regarded overall. I'm not into the warhammer universe at all but I had a lot of fun with the game.
---
Has an app and physical game, and lets you scan your physical cards to unlock the same cards in app, pretty neat concept which I look forward to more games incorporating. 
---
Played WoW before?
---
Yeah, but that's limited. That's one format with very different considerations than constructed. Haste is still fantastic when you want to push a lot of damage.
---
Is that card-for-card? Pokémon TCG has a QR code in each physical booster that redeems in the digital version for a booster from the same set.
---
1 mana deal 11 to all enemies seems almost as unbalanced as hunter almost
---
&gt; i wish i could go to every guy who cried when K&amp;C came out that they wanted the beast pool for DK rexar to be updated and just punch them in the nuts
---
chill. they wanted what was correct and made sense. it was such a stupid idea to limit the pool of a card. there is no other example of "discover x, but only from w y z expansions" kind of card. it simply doesn't make any sense other than being lazy about updating pool every time.
---
That's like half the ranks! Gosh golly 
---
I think it should be "(2) or less".  The problem with (3) is that it's still a relatively high mana cost for a spell.  Prep + Evis is a classic and it feels fair.  There are hardly any good 3 mana Rogue spells though, due to Prep.  The only recent (3) mana spell for Rogue that was any good was Raiding Party, and that got Kingsbane nerfed out of existence.
---
I wouldn't say that haste is weaker than charge. Charge can combo harder and stone tusk boar should have never been printed, but in general if you're playing aggro in magic, you're probably playing haste. If you're playing aggro in hearthstone, there's a good chance the only charge card in your deck is leeroy jenkins.
---
Yea but it doesn’t have much traction against secret

---
Yes, I know, which is why I said this exact thing in my post. What I was curious about is whether or not duplicate minions dying increases the chance of one of them being resurrected over other minions where only a single one died.
---
Jaraxxus actually is op! Sadly the game has so much power creep now he just didn’t keep up
---
Stormwind Knight created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. We like having a variety of deck types but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not very fun or interactive.
---
Just about everything is getting hit very hard by rotation. KFT and KnC are two of the strongest sets ever printed, meanhile WW, TBP, and RR are some of the weaker expansions. 
---
The decks that have the highest chance of survival are likely Baku and Genn decks. Specifically Odd Warrior, Odd Rogue, Odd Paladin, Even Shaman, and Even Paladin. Even Warlock is less likely to survive. 
---
Of those mentioned above, Odd Warrior is the least affected. 
---
Well it is op... If you play rogue/miracle...
---
Deathwing! It was my first legendary, I jammed it into every single deck and played it when I my terrible decks were about to lose

Many of crucial Odd paly cards such as [[Level-up]], [[Lost in the Jungle]] and [[Vinecleaver]] are from the expansions you mentioned above so Odd paly is gonna take a hit

Yeah, I’m expecting them to cut off support for Hearthstone’s professional play. They never really committed to it very much in the first place, with no tournament client, no local play, dropping nerfs or interaction changes in the middle of tournaments, and so on. 
---
Hearthstone gets a lot of free promotion from streamers that don’t play in professional tournaments, so I wouldn’t be surprised if they wanted to “trim the fat” and remove that division altogether like how they killed HGC.

2/2/2 | Whenever this minion attacks a hero, add the Coin to your hand.  
---
Focus on a single deck, I got to legend with spiteful priest about a year ago and the key is to know how to deal with different matchups 
---
Going for spell hunter then as it is my most optimized deck. 
---
I am playing with TTK Shirvallah deck with this combo, and after 30 games I had like 75% WR, but then I got a losestreak to around 56%. I have only Undatakah, Shirvallah and Thekal as legendaries, so they somehowvcompensate loss of DK and Kangor.
---
I have 2 win conditions- Holy Wrath combo and Infinite taunt. But my main target is to stay alive. Sometimes during the game I have to play my Shirvallah+Banker to get fast heal or play Holy Wrath to deal damage to a minion to stay alive. Sometimes I even have to lose all parts of my TTK combo and try to win with with Undatakah.
---
So, I would add Shirvallah with so you can clear board and heal in a dangerous situation. No need to include whole TTK combo, Shirvallah is just a pretty good card.
---
Maybe add Zola / Baleful Banker because of the synergy with Shirvallah.
---
Also 2 Time Outs would be good, they can save your life and a Time Out is good to play on 10 mana with Silver Vanguard.
---
Thekal? I wouldn't say he is a good option, because he is good only on turn 3 or before the DK. 
---
Yeah it's very different with the rotating buffs and lack of minions, definitely worth a try for a few hours. If you like it the cool thing is you can buy the cards and decks IRL and use them in the digital version, while still earning in game currency for digital only cards, pretty cool. 
---
Like like a great way to increase stabbings.
---
Alternatively, just give everyone the core set on rotation. Provided they're all fairly basic interactions, you'd still end up buying roughly the same number of packs, and it would be a huge help to new players having their core set always filled out.
---
Think of it more like a larger basic set that rotates every year.

Hey Endru11, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters.

Maybe nerf the pool to only include single keywords, and remove the beasts that gain keywords from card text. Seems balanced. That would of course also remove everything related to adapt. 
---
Charged Devilsaur is 5 expansions ago  And I totally agree, that blizzard don't have to print lots of cards with the same mechanic, but they always seem to leave them hanging one expansion later. Just look at how many mechs we got one exp right after Boomsday - 0.

Clearly you need to share your karma with the poor and needy

[[Gelbin Mekkatorque]]. ...I mean, not *op*, but certainly better than [[Boulderfist Ogre]]. For one less point of health, you get a 0/3 with an effect that's always more likely to benefit you than your opponent. But I was basically the only one to feel that way.
---
...Actually, I still insist that it's a better Boulderfist Ogre. Pretty much all the criticism of Mekkatorque was "I don't like that it can sometimes backfire", which is just... not legitimate criticism.

I got a little bit of video of the deck in action. Didn’t manage to get loads of bombers but other minions are just as good:
---
https://youtu.be/-xxMmrzV-vk
---
I had about 5 Amaras in my deck
---
If that was me i would have been offered a bucket of three 2 mana cards. 
---
Yup. If Hozen were beasts, Jinyu, (fish people), Saurok (lizard people) and pandaren should be too! And that ain't right.
---
I wouldn't exactly call Cthun a "1-turn combo" if you spent the previous 19 turns buffing him...  
---
Oh lord, that attitude won’t fly on this sub mate... Unless you want to get downvoted to oblivion, change that perky realistic attitude to one where you regurgitate salty negativity in new, edgy ways while assuming that the worldwide community is accurately reflected in this sub. 
---
Now does this mean crazed alchemist on the 8/8 give a 10/6 instead of a 10/8? Since game think it really had 6attack when doubling. My bet it's a 10/8 because blizzard logic.
---
Why are there 3 duplicate cards in a staring hand? How is that possible?
---
Are there any saurok in Hearthstone?
---
If only there was a dope weapon that healed your face that rewarded you for playing AE
---
Mecha'thun warrior. The only 2017 card in the deck is Blood Razor.
---
The mage legendary that gives you cards “from the past”, too. 
---
Yup.
---
Yeah thats what he said, viable, not top tier
---
I dont get why you have more botes than him and especially dont understand why he is downvoted
---
He literally didnt even imply it was top tier
---
large if factual
---
Basically in Magic, first strike means the creature does damage to before taking damage from a creature without it. So a 3/2 kills and survives against a 4/3.
---
Double strike is like a forced wind fury. You attack the same target twice, first during the first strike phase then again during the normal damage phase, which means a 3/2 with double strike would kill a x/6 creature. Very powerful keyword. 
---
I always greet prior to squelching, it’s like a routine I have now whenever a match starts.
---
1 damage off lethal aswell. F
---
but if you blessed champion on  a 1/1 with stormwind, do you  get 3 or 4 or 5 attack?  
---
also your math doesn't add up with the 2/4.  2x+y in your case equals 3, not 4.
---
What is the lethal here i dont get it
---
I really like this deck but I also already have Stormbringer, which I feel would have good synergy with this deck. Which card should I swap it out for?
---
But it can be buffed, unlike feral spirits. That’s one of the only, minor, differences between the two cards
---
As if freeze mage and miracle rogue were NOT both meta decks for years 🤔
---
&gt; Why make hardcore stuff if it's the casual stuff that sells?
---
It is actually possible to make games (and in turn money) for putting something out there that people will love.  Not everything in this world needs to constantly make more and more money.  There was a time when Blizzard did just that, and it's what got them so well respected.
---
I'm sick of seeing the argument that X makes more money therefore it HAS to happen.   Behind every desk is a person who wants to make money, but also something meaningful. Unfortunately behind any reasonable sized company are investors who want profits to always be more. 
---
*their social media pages are ran by the same company. 
---
you don’t add by email, you add by battletag
---
I hope when they (definitely won’t because they don’t like us eternal format players) make a new modern format, they just make it modern. I understand it’s probably a lot of effort to have to code that many cards for the game but they’ve already done it before... and they have plenty of time and money, why not?
---
lolz the turn tables
---
My experience is opposite. 
---
for you it is all about playing your deck and getting your win condition as quickly as you can
---
I made a new friend too in arena yesterday.  He told me I was a fucking moron and should quit playing Hearthstone because I beat him despite making a couple misplays.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/9uwlss/battletag_findafriend_zandalar_edition/?sort=new
---
Well if you needed background knowledge you could just google it... the game is based off WoW, it is going to have similarities 
---
well shit I would hope you did lol
---
... you notice that *now?*
---
This explains it all. Having a few control decks while still being an F2P players (or maybe just spending a few dimes instead of a fortune). This is what sold me on Eternal. 
---
I do agree the recent new mechanics kinda get things go crazy sometimes but well, they can’t satisfy everyone, no one can. 
---
So go face hard and fast and compare hands?
---
At that point you just go for boar control
---
thats not kingsbane
---
True, but now the phone market is booming more than ever before, and Blizz is sorta putting all the focus on that market and sorta ditching all the other platforms. Plus you can game anywhere when on the phone, and for a much cheaper cost than other platforms, thus a bigger audience reach.
---
I have yet to see a gonk druid that just runs gonk beast and double witching hour to get two out for the stacking attacks.
---
&gt; Of all Blizzard franchises it fell like Hearthstone is the last one, where they will cut costs.
---
It's hard to cut costs when you're barely putting any money into it anyway.
---
if that happens the game is dead within a year
---
All budget  Shaman decks will focus on Bloodlust because it's a free wincon.
---
Starcraft II is an almost 9 year old single player game, it should be in maintenance mode. Heroes of the Storm was a copycat game of 2 wildly popular games that didn't need copies, and WoW is also ancient in a time when MMORPGs are fading. I don't think Blizzard's problem is maintenance of their current games, I think it's a lack of creativity. Trying to milk old games or copy popular games instead of innovating.  
---
  
---
Although I don't think Hearthstone has any decent competitors. Gwent and Artifact flopped and I can't even remember the name of the game that game out with Gwent it's such a non-factor. I hear the new Magic game is pretty good though, so that might be a real competitor.
---
I have zero problem with this. Charge is the least interactive mechanic in the game. It’s just straight damage you can prevent unless you play a deck with all taunt minions like quest warrior. The reason charge (haste) works in other games like Mtg is because of the ability to block. 
---
one time i had a guy get 3 murk eyes in a row and i'm glad that card is not played much lol
---
I don’t think your deck is bad, but you might want to speed up your “DIE INSECT!” ability.  😈
---
Try swapping out the rabble rousers and a bear with Zola and a pair of Blackwald Pixies.  
---
Zola has been super helpful in either completing my quest before T10 (best scenario is using her on a Stonehill defender for an extra pair of taunts).  Blackwald Pixies help me catch an opponent by surprise when I can blast their face for 16 out of nowhere.

I hear you. There's nothing more annoying than the new atheist who keeps showing up to Sunday night youth-group bowling night just so he can tell his old friends that religion is BS. On the other hand, I've invested a lot in the Hearthstone religion, been a member from the beginning, and there's this feeling of obligation to speak the truth. This church isn't healthy, financially or spiritually, and I'm not sure it's ethical to stay silent. 
---
I don’t rope people at all. I mean I play dumb when they add me and spew angry crap at me. I act delighted to see a new friend and whatnot. 
---
Are you trying to say that Hearthstone is popular because of its wonderfully large budget?
---
thats the thing about aggro though. any decent aggro deck can close out a game by turn seven if the opponent doesn't draw their answers. often times playing vs aggro with a slower deck is just a question of "what are my first seven cards?"
---
one of the reasons odd pally was and is so good is they can just keep refilling the board, every, single, turn and continue to threaten lethal time after time.

Next turn a 2/3 is a 5/6. The following turn a 3/3 is a 6/6.
---
So yeah, unless he draws shitty spells or all 8 mana minions for the next 5 turns, you should lose that almost every time. 
---
It's working as intended if you know how buff order works, and bless champion unlike inner fire, actually doubles the currently calculated attack value instead of setting the attack value to a specific number determined on cast. So the attack is ((2+4)*2)+2 instead of 2 +4 -&gt; set to 16 then add 2.
---
For wild you can play an aggro token druid w/o any legendaries. I’ll post my list here in a few min for you. (On my phone atm)
---
literally 100x more unlikely to happen than anything to happen to kripp
---
there are several possibilites which it could be and none of them is certain
---
a)some kind of joke as u say
---
b)he doesnt know the card
---
c) he kinda misread it and confused it with kingsbane-having short glimpse of image on mobile etc.
---
d) just wants to troll with misinformation??
---
so is my comment really that bad? I give you some hints:
---
1) all choices are possible and my comment adressed most possibilites
---
2) someone of viewers who doesnt know these cards could be confused- I help to clear the misunderstanding
---
3) considering the joke side-like what its point?
---
-its not really played significantly more after  leeching poison nerf, it raised slightly but its not even at november levels, also if we compare overall occurence, its about 2% of rogue decks but kingsabne was about 25% before nerf, dont u see a difference? is something similar to kingsbane its odd rogue
---
- considering weapon size, you could always buff it same as kingsbane and it was present at same so thats also doesnt make much sense
---
sometimes must man just wonder how ppl quickly want to push that downvote button without second thought, especially on this reddit, props to you and downvote me some more
---
I don’t think there has ever been a game where I felt like stonehill defender was unfair. It kind of falls in that sludge belcher category where it is just good without being oppressive or triggering a broken combo.
---
OP is not good at the game
---
To be faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
---
It's very balanced
---
My apologies my fellow tea and crumpets connoisseur. If you'll excuse me I'll grab my top hat and throw on my cape and be on my way.
---
\*crack*
---
*wosoosh *
---
It has an average winrate per deck of 54% and some with even 60%+  so I think it's more than just it's playrate playing into the success of this card.
---
Interestingly enough you won't have to look far if you want a Marvel card game(in physical form anyways).
---
Honestly a little bit coincidence.. they are 7 health rush minions is perhaps the most important thing.. rush being important so u can kill them with cloning gallery to generate 1/1 tokens...
---
Devilasurs are uniquely valuable for the resurect ability to go face
---
The oondasta synergy and star aligner synergy is like an added bonus.. not essential but useful
---
I took it 5-2 last season but had an accident which has led to mr barely playing over the past couple of weeks
---
At least Spider-Man was able to get out of their stranglehold and into Insomniac’s loving loving arms.
---
So? What you say still doesn't change anything about what I just said lmao. Do you want every single good card go get nerfed? Bevause if Actizzard would actually listen to this sub after the last nerfes we would all play with 1 mana 1/1s, 2 mana 2/2s, 3 mana 3/3s... You get the idea. And then people would start cry how *Op AnD bRoKeN* the coin is. 
---
Where do you play that you are running into them?
---
Same kind of names?
---
Not even when playing against Odd Paladin with 2 Tarims?
---
What about cubes? It has great synergy with most of the cards 
---
Just because its played in decks that are strong, doesn't mean it itself is Strong? 
---
It was a joke. That's why you got downvoted. Try not to over think things. 
---
F
---
Why would it be broken? You're the third person to comment that it would be broken with absolutely no justification about why it would be broken. 
---
And if your comment is to be followed to its conclusion, if there's a way for it to be too good and a way for it to be too weak then obviously it's possible to find a way to make it work in the middle... like every other mechanic. 
---
How u going to trigger it? Do u want to ressurect one? Do u want one in a cloning gallery?
---
I think the deck is pretty refined tbh.. cubes would be good against odd quest warrior which is a tough game (winnable with enough ressurect).. but against anything else it is unnecesarily greedy
---
Oh lul. 
---
ah thats interesting  
---
thanks for the info
---
I just think it was very unhealthy for the game to keep this card in the game for 2 years (or even print it with such OP taunts in rotation but that's just me) and it would just be consistent reasoning from blizzard to nerf this card.
---
I’m an old player, since vanilla. My favorite thing to do was to bust out Timmy decks with Druid using a bunch of legendaries I bought to randomly upset people trying to ladder. 
---
Recently I tried this and went something like 0-29. That’s not fun! I think there’s space for a bling Timmy deck in this game, but 0-29 seems like it should never happen with honest attempts at deck building. It never happened before this recent wild growth nerf. 
---
But it makes it manageable. So it's not a game breaking issue.
---
The comment before just talked for 2 paragraphs on why it should be fixed and not just "worked around". This bug just happened once to me, but lost me a game that I should've won. I didn't knew about the bug. Some people don't know what triggers the bug (most of the Hearthstone community). You can just fix the bug. It's that easy.
---
It's not so much broken as one of the most infuriating possible mechanics to play against. in most cases.
---
In particular, classes like Paladin have almost zero access to efficient removal other than minion combat and weapons, and if the Paladin is already losing, removing the card preventing you from playing something like Tirion and stabilizing would be far from the easiest thing to do.
---
munchroot literally just Aviana 2
---
"they don't fire people because of bad profit, on the contrary, they do so because of profit."
---
or future potential profit. Guess I did the wording wrong. Basically they want to earn money, but with less risk, investment and innovation, which is the opposite of what the old Blizzard has done.
---
Wendys sucks too. So they go together. Birds of a feather flock together.
---
Use a fast deck and pray to RNGesus. Not much else you can do, as they are fewer combo disruptions in the game right now, and most OTK decks are not interactive at all.
---
Making a card that you can only have 1 copy of, that makes bad standalone cards OP, is poor design. You can't get a single legendary out every game, and making a deck that loses its synergy when 3 damage is deal to a minion is insanely stupid.
---
&gt;rushian
---
Do you mean Russian?
---
Im sorry.. my little brother just passed away. Can't even spell right
---
You might mean that as Withering Witch and Black-Sky Harbinger. Yes, that was a good combo, too mana-expensive, but I’ve turned around games using that combo. Lol 
---
I really hope MTGA would be on mobile, here’s to it happening in the future (come on, even an iPad only release should be do-able *crossing fingers*). 
---
It's pretty often lol
---
Ya can’t argue with that either
---
I wouldn’t say Rush killed Charge... Charge killed Charge by making aggro too viable. Rush can be used well in a variety of deck types and doesn’t make aggro oppressive.
---
Your alt key might be stuck then.
---
That's exactly right. Think of a time in your life when you felt really, genuinely happy. Did it occur to you to ruin someone's day and spread misery then? Of course it didn't. Now think of a time when everything just sucked. Were you maybe a little pissed and emotionally volatile, and much more likely to jump down someone's throat?
---
Yeah. Trolls like that are not in a good place. They're miserable, pathetic, pitiful creatures, and all they know to do is spread hate and try to make others feel as bad as they do themselves. 
---
Maybe it's not so much annoying people as much as the gaming landscape changing significantly rather quickly, and SC2 was released at the end of that kind of game's popularity.  MOBAs took over for a while as THE big thing, now we're in the battle royale phase of things.
---
I actually was under the impression that you'd always get a gold legendary with 12 wins. Since I've gotten one with just 11 wins which till date is the highest I've gotten. Don't recall if it was gold or normal tho.

I got it after 25 attempts with the frostfire freeze shrine. Got close multiple times. I had an insane triple deathrattle priest. Got against the card steal rogue shrine, stole 2 seance and my shadow caster. He got 4 shrines and I was out of cards turn 6 or so. I was so close to punching my monitor.
---
Land destruction in Magic: The Gathering is something almost universally hated by the playerbase, and the only people who like it are those that take joy in others suffering. Stealing lands is even worse and almost unheard of as far as I am aware because it is just too strong. Artifact theft is fine because not all artifacts produce mana.
---
In Hearthstone, it would be just as infuriating as it is in Magic, and should never even be considered whether or not the stolen crystals are full. It sets your opponent too far back while also accelerating you too fast for them to reasonably recover. Plus, sometimes the cards do not line up right to use all of them on any given turn.
---
You haven't been to a walmart near me apparently.
---
Just because a card is polarizing does not mean it is a poorly designed card. A polarizing card (not always, but mostly) becomes poorly designed when it jeopardizes the enjoyment of the game. I'd argue that defile is actually a much worse design than overwhelming force for this exact reason. If you're playing a control deck and your 12/12 got taken out for 3 mana, yea it stings but what did you expect? They put that card in their deck for that exact reason. If you're playing an aggro deck, get cleared by the first defile and then get cleared two turns later by the other defile, what can you do? They drew both defiles by turn 5, you never had a chance no matter how good things looked.
---
Peak nitpicking, good job
---
No problem!  Hakkar has surprisingly won me a fair amount of games. Typically I win either by hakkar or opponent conceded to inevitability. It can be weak to some other weird decks though. Got smashed the other day by pogo rogue. It can be real good against hunter. Usually hakkar wins against hunter. Don’t be afraid to take your time against control. Fish for mass hysteria, etc... vs aggro. Games can get reeeeal long. 
---
I wouldn’t advocate crafting hakkar for this unless you really want to. I had silence for the Undatakah druids from a few weeks ago. Just haven’t taken it out yet. Glimmerroots could probably be replaced too but I find them very useful. Every so often though the draws are just awful and you feel like all the deathrattles are at the bottom. 
---
And I understand this, but there's a huge difference between not knowing that this bug exists and this post. OP knew about this bug and it costed him FOUR games. If theres a workaround it is OP's fault. Not for the bug, but for allowing this to happen over and over.
---
Now that you know about this, what will you do until they fix it? Post a stupid rant everytime this happens to you or try to take a second or two to click your rush minion. 
---
&gt;You can just fix the bug.
---
No, we can't fix it, devs can. What we can do is not repeat it. No one is saying this shouldn't be fixed, we are saying there's a really easy way to avoid this. 
---
Very sorry to hear that. That's horrible.
---
history bar
---
Right now? Midrange hunter, the budget version, it’s surprisingly good by how cheap the whole thing is.
---
If you have some dust, Odd Paladin is T1 and not that expensive either.
---
Those are your best bets right now.
---
So it's Hearthstone related news and as such gets posted here..?
---
It's a multi million dollar company. It is as easy as pressing a button.
---
Regardless of how "good" a player I am, I don't have any good legendaries, so I can't make any good decks. No grumble, no lich King, no good death knights, no floop, no odd, no even, no unstable evolution, not enough food epics to run a meta deck, so I want to play casual, but I can't because it's either top tier or starter deck.
---
But pirate mechathun works with raiding party being a three Mana draw three, captain hooktusk summoning three pirates from deck, and taunt and rush pirates being good at stalling the game to win with mechathun, coin (from wanted), prep, into walk the plank if I don't win early by playing pirates.
---
And I can't play wild. No thaurasan. Like I say I have no good legendaries, but I literally have no wild legendaries.
---
And the Liam combo is turn six Liam with only other minions in deck being witchwood Piper, and the rest of the deck being one drop spells and weapons (in case you were wondering, since those other Liam decks are running Baku, I'll gaurentee it).
---
[removed]
---
Good talk then. You're much more detailed and responsive then other people which I really appreciate. I also appreciate that you can understand that there's a lot more to custom cards than hypothetical balance based on personal opinions. For the record, I have been playing this game for years and am [legend ranked.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/195968578023849984/449219245457276931/image.png?width=901&amp;height=676)
---
Discussion like this is good I think. It opens people's eyes up to new perspectives and has them consider new ideas and possibilities; even if some people are less open to doing so. I just like to get the most out of it. To understand how one came to that point of view, to fully identify the potential issues, and to figure out ways to fix them. Only through discussion can that happen and not through shallow comments.
---
Make sure you play the 4 Mana 3/3 that draws the lowest cost minion. It draws the cards from academic
---
My bad. I bounced off of World of Warcraft after Wrath of the lich king and have never heard of the “hozen” race. 
---
To me it just looked like a beast similar to Muklas champion. A beast doing something a beast normally wouldn’t do. 
---
It is, every fourth Game in ranks 4-2 is versus OTK DK paladin
---
&gt; There was a overpowered giants deck that used naga before it got buffed? That’s what you seem to imply to me when I mentioned that naga was fine before it got buffed.
---
Never said that, i said that when it got "corrected" (and not buffed) so that it would apply its effect correctly and consistently taking into account the interactions of other discount cards, it actually was discovered to be busted with the giants. That discount rule is still applied, and therefore the 6/7/7 would be busted because it will behave like naga sea witch.
---
Yeah, if it worked like old discount naga (bugged naga) then yeah, it would be fine, but thats not how the card would work **based on his current wording**. So either the creator would have to change the wording to make it not discount the giants first, or just increase its mana cost considerably/change the effect. It is an interesting card, but its way beyond broken if implemented in the game.
---
Zentimo casts no matter what, so even if it was a Darkness it would kill it.
---
That’s what I’m saying. Even a bad player with a decent deck should be able to hit the rank 5 floor. 
---
Cards will randomly show as new, even if nothing happened to that card in a while. This has happened since closed beta...
---
I stand corrected then. It's not an obvious flavor though.
---
You do get how ridiculous that sounds, right?
---
Took me a bit to figure it out because I forgot about Dr. Boom's rush effect. Nice pic lol.
---
It's insane to me that this bug hasn't been fixed yet. I found youtube videos from like 2015 pointing this bug out. I know the bug is manageable and it probably only happens in 0.01% of my games but those games feel so bad to lose and make me want to uninstall. 
---
Basically at this point I'm rooting for this bug to ruin a big HCT tournament. A player gets to the end of the rope, has to move quickly, but then the glitch pops up and screws them over. It's probably the only way Blizzard will ever fix it at this point. 
---
This is the [Reaver Mill (Howlfiend Lock)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fbmRZpv_3s&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;a=), it was piloted to #1 legend in China a few months ago. I have also piloted a similar list to legend.
---
The Crow/Warper combo is a similar shell but uses these two combos instead. Hitting 3-4x pieces with Emperor is needed.
---
OTK
---
* Sum Portal
---
* Crowskin
---
* Mechwarper
---
* Zilliax
---
* Treachery
---
* Wrathguard
---
Mill
---
* Missile Launcher
---
* Acolyte of Pain
---
Chilwind yeti played by a druid
---
Can't wait for DK's especially Rexxar to rotate
---
&gt; How exactly do you counter the OTK decks plaguing  the current meta? 
---
Playing proactively. That is, putting your yeties on the board and directing them into opponent's face. When you do this enough times, they cannot play their combo because they are dead. Winrates of OTK decks "plaguing" current meta say that this strategy is quite effective. 
---
Even if you know how it happens you can still have games where it pops up. The glitch happens so rarely that it's never the first thing on your mind. Sometimes you're more preoccupied with what your play is going to be, sometimes you're multitasking while playing HS, etc. So then you accidentally click too quickly and go "ah fuck, right, I forgot about this bullshit." 
---
It shouldn't be in the game at all. 
---
It's not ridiculous at all, it's just the truth. No one would play anything made by Blizzard if it didn't have Blizzard's name on it. Blizzard literally has a monopoly over every genre they touch that isn't ARPGs because Diablo is actually so bad that not even their name could drown out PoE. Despite there being objectively better MMOs, card games, ARPGs, RTSes, and FPSes, Blizzard games win because of the borderline cult that is their fanbase.
---
Cool, thanks!
