---
---
umbra is more of a combo card, anubis is a value card
---
Patches.
---
Patchwork
---
what do you mean?
---
The Grand Tournament 
---

---
The neutral legendaries were niche , and the class legendaries were never seen outside of Paletress. 
---
Joust was an rng mechanic that relied on high rolls and inspire was a mechanic that relied on you using your hero power, 
---
It introduced the monsters known as Mysterious Challenger and Totem Golem /Tuskarr Totemic . This would mark the rise of Shaman Stone. 
---
It did introduce some cool cards which would shape future mechanics , such as Lock and Load ( which would lead to Yogg )and Burgle.
---
That would be way better than having the two split up, since ordinarily you'd need to first find Rafaam's Scheme, charge it up, then find Plague of Flames before the combo is useful. It would also free up a card slot, which is huge.
---
On the other hand, having them split up does make PoF more flexible with other cards like Fiendish Circle, SN1P-SN4P, Scarab Egg, etc... So I'm a little torn on which would be better in practice.
---
Awesome art, either way!
---
What the fuck went wrong with artifact?
---
I like licking toes. 
---
Did I do it right?
---
It hasn’t been good because there is nothing except that card that upgrades your imps +1 and deal 1 to enemy minions and darkest hour. The problem with the first one is it is a terrible board clear and the +1 didn’t matter cause the imps would all die or it is isn’t enough to beat other aggro decks. Darkest hour had a similar problem. They would all die before you get the combo off or it is just too slow to use on turn 9. This however is what it has been missing. The scheme had little to no support. Now you have a reason to play the card. Either darkest hour combo OR clear their board with this new card. It is a very effective board clear against big boards like giants or flooded boards like murlocs. Every new warlock card this expansion is making rise of shadow cards more effective.
---
This would not see any play at all. It was an optional card in a tier 2 deck for 1 expansion.
---
I don't know what I mean sry :P
---
Zola gives two, and if there's another that says "copy of" it will too
---
"Your deathrattles can trigger once per turn whenever a minion dies." Perhaps? Given the nerf, I think it would be fair to no longer have it limited to minion's deathrattles or on the deaths of friendly minions
---
I'm about fifty fifty at this point. If I don't care for the current standard meta I like wild because I feel like I can build whatever and it some what works. But if the standard meta is healthy I love grinding a metadeck and tryharding by researching matchups, mulligans, winrates and all that. Also I've been spending probably a majority of my time playing recently on heist, I seriously think it's one of the best things they've introduced to hearthstone. No turn timers make it perfect to play at work during downtime, plus all the different builds keep it fresh. (Also how difficult heroic chapter 5 is lol)
---
I think Nozari's a perfectly okay card to print - but it would imply that any deck that uses it need to look towards the late game, since you don't care about healing your opponent. When you look at the cards Paladin received for Dragon support though, the support is based around tempo and handbuffs (Dragon Speaker, the neutral Dragon cards like Crowd Roaster etc). Leaving aside the question of whether the dragon support is good enough to make a viable deck (spoiler: it isn't) Nozari doesn't gel with the existing Dragon support at all for that reason. In fact Nozari doesn't really fit with any existing Paladin archetype except maybe combo (although could be argued healing your opponent could potentially be bad here as well, especially if your opponent has armour) since Paladin has never received value and card generation to a level where you could compete with other Control decks in the late game.
---
I almost did that twice, though the second time I got 6 before the win
---
Yes, Zavas retains those buffs as well. But this is fine and according to rules.
---
When discards happen, a card is being moved from the hand zone to a graveyard zone/discard pool. But this does not happen to Clutchmother Zavas, because a triggered discard will be negated by her ability.
---
Read her card text this way: "Whenever you discard this, don't discard this and give it +2/+2." So basically the discard trigger resolves itself and all what's left is a handbuff effect. Zavas is not moved away from the hand zone and thus keeps applied buffs.
---
[Official blog post for further reading ("Copy A Card Rule Change") ...](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/21965466/)
---
Nozari would be playable if it only healed you, and not your enemy, at 10 mana.
---
Your getting downvoted but I laughed.
---
Finally. Rise of shadow cards really didn’t do anything to help warlock. This expansion is definitely helping the class and boosting the power of previously released expansion cards.
---
i started playing on the day when K&amp;C camo out but back then i didnt know that and was so confused with all the quest from mean streets
---
Have we graduated to being salty about tavern brawl meta?
---
Nope, standard.
---
Not all versions run Luna, but yeah. Although zilli is just an amazing craft, independent of the deck.
---
and what do you mean by that? how do you not know what you said? just tell what you meant by ''  Some guys made dad legend today and someone made a joke about the new lackey. ''
---
Agree but deck thinning is a huge benifit to aggro. Warlocks fav
---
This is the dumbest sentence in the history of this sub.
---
Big mood card art
---
Damn I'm not seeing enough rastakhans rumble in here.
---
I dunno, I’d consider preserving the timeline a pretty Good sort of service. Considering we’re all using it.
---
Priest is uh...... oh
---
Nice combo! Ignore the haters. They are too dumb to have fun.
---
Yep! They show up like once or twice a week
---
Too expensive
---
it kinda doesn't tho,i think only one other pally card cares about the cost of the card draw unless you consider joust a thing (which it really isn't). I kinda wish they just went all out on this class identity stuff, trade cards between classes to where they make sense, HoF everything that isn't in line with the identity and nerf all cards that limit design space.
---
Paladin identity crisis huh? Maybe the new card should be "Mysterious Class";
---
Who am I? NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS! :D
---
So have I. You do realize that every month the ranks reset and not everyone has the time to climb again? You are definitely not a high thinker.
---
It’s the phantom taunt. The taunt that lingers through your foes heads.
---
Typical newb. You definitely don't main play paladin, we are higher thinkers.
---
**I like your deck. I think I will TAKE IT!**
---
As Hitler would have said: purity, elimination, perfection
---
Those are actually, 2 very nice ways of looking at them.
---
&gt;**Choose one:**
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Tempo deck. 
---
&gt;Quest.
---
This is so wrong. The best deck in wild, Quest Mage, does both.
---
This was a really good comment
---
No one, ever. It's a value card. And it clearly backfired here lol.
---
I’d probably play it in some class’s decks.
---
And it looks like you got there with decent winrate, congrats!
---
Ah, right, EE would do it.  Coin's too much of a... well, coin flip to get it.
---
Who?
---
actually not the coin, just ee yeah
---
That deck was fun, but give me NG spies any day of the week, in any of its incarnations
---
Friends introduced me to the game during GvG. I wasn’t too impressed at the time so I don’t remember much about it except running into Mech Mages, Oil Rogues and Aggro Hunters. I lost interest after about a week of play. (I’m not faulting those decks, I just wasn’t into the game in general.)
---
Friends were hooked on the game though, so I got to watch them play during TGT. Now _that_ expansion caught my eye. Watching decks like Patron Warrior, Zoolock and Handlock in action was exhilarating! I remember being amazed with how skill-intensive these decks were to pilot and how intricate their turns could be. Decks like Secret Paladin and Force-of-Nature Combo Druid, on the other hand, were hilarious to me because of their ridiculous blowout turns. (I know now they were hated at the time but I’ve never been the sort to hate on decks. I’ve always appreciated both the skill-intensive and crazy in the game. I was just immensely entertained and have always taken the game for what it was.)
---
So I got into the game then. A friend helped me build my first complete deck to learn with - Zoolock. Stuck mostly to Casual. I had my first taste of Ranked Ladder with Xixo’s Spell Druid in Karazhan.
---
Does not look like the technology is quite there yet.
---
So they coexisted for one expansion, is what you're saying
---
There wasn't, originally. They added a leveling system that gave you packs/card earning game mode runs though. A bit too late.
---
Though, it did have an arena gamemode for free - which was honestly nice.
---
Ah sorry to hear that :(
---
I'll probably look into it eventually, give it a shot
---
What is there to see?
---
I only really like control mage tbh. Tempo or cyclone feel really draw depending and I hate losing right away bc I didn’t draw giant or cyclone or cc. Or my cyclone gave me crap spells lol. 
---
And token Druid is great at lower ranks (below 15) because a lot of people don’t kill my board. Of course the higher I climb the harder it is to get a set up lol. I played it a bunch last month and had a 69% win rate according to blizzard lmao.
---
That card is too good. Would fit better in Druid.
---
If we're going to dream of improvements, how about a third button: draft a new deck Arena style.
---
It is almost worse than Fireblast. Almost.
---
I mean, that probably winds up being a cosmically Good thing too at the end of the day. Lord knows there are enough plots in fiction that revolve around attempting to change the past for the better only to create a worse future.
---
That is actually the case
---
To be fair, with the Innkeeper's accent drifting from Glasgow to Dublin for no adequately explained reason it's not always easy to decipher him.
---
Actual question. What is a skill-based aggressive deck? Could you give me an example?
---
of course I've looked the decks up - and I still get screwed. BADLY. How I lucked out the last time I beat chapter 3, I'll never know. I just end up conceding if I get Ichoron ... it feels like there are certain bosses I'm just not meant to beat - not SKILLED enough, anyways.
---
Big brain time
---
&gt; They make perfect mechanical and symbolic sense with the class' philosophy.
---
I just explained to you why this is not the case.  Murlocs make more sense in Druid or Hunter than Paladin.
---
&gt;you can make pretty much anything sound out of place.
---
No, you can't.  It is next to impossible to argue that Warrior shouldn't have weapons, for example, or that Hunter shouldn't work with beasts.
---
If you, personally, do not care about class flavor, that is fine (I infer this from the fact that you refuse to engage with the argument that Murlocs are bad flavor for Paladin).  But in that case, it doesn't make sense for you to tell other people not to care about it.  Personally, I think that class flavor is about half of what makes Hearthstone a successful game, and that maintaining its integrity is vital to the long-term health of the game.
---
"Hearthstone Deck Tracker" should be the first one on google, -HSReplay.net or something along those lines, free

It gives you both and also the anomaly mode

Even the arena gamemode had no free option at first. It got added very shortly after the outcry at launch though.

Look at the date.
---
How come it has taunt each time?
---
How comes the undatakah's battlecry works when recruited?
---
It would still be really good on Hearthstone. Think AI but 1 less Mana and 2 more damage.
---
another nerf to the classic set :(
---
I feel you! Really like the theme of the class: righteousness, justice etc. Played a Paladin in early WoW and loads of Paladin/Crusader in Diablo. Have been playing Control Paladin for most of the time, because it builds on the defender/survival part of the class. I loved old 2 mana [[equality]]. I love Pyro shenanigans. I love Peacekeeper + Kodo. I love to outlast the enemy.

It doesn't, but the immortal prelate buff keeps all of the other buffs
---
It's the immortal prelate's deathrattle, not the battlecry

Oh, sorry, lol.

How much have you spent in total on the game? Just wondering
---
well actually, that's a quote by Albert Einstein, not Caeser

Vanish got Hall of Fame'd for whatever reason, the only form of boardclear rogue had...

So if you don't play wild, only silence or sap are dangerous.

Perfection.

Yeeuuuuup I've been there. I feel you're pain ;-;7
---
This is wild. His opponent has a DK in play.
---
The rouge has Deathknight out....
---
It's a rather complicated spell and quite breakable
---
Yep. The only problem is that if the Silver Vanguard deathrattle gets copied first, then the order of the deathrattles will make it so he doesnt recruit himself (since the game will first try to Recruit and 8-drop, THEN shuffle him into the deck). He’ll be guaranteed to go infinite the next time you play him, but by then it could be too late and you’ll be dead. I like to get 2 Prelate Deathrattles into the mix so that the chances of it failing are 33% instead of a 50% coinflip. Thats why in the clip I killed off that Prelate before going in, because i’d be dead if Undatakah missed
---
Well it kept coming in the full version it will be "the only way you won't craft me is if you find me in your packs, I am the very model of the neutral fav'rite Zilliax"
---
I want to see this brawl except everyone is given a random 12-0 Arena deck from the past month.
---
Your paint skills are impressive, you must be very proud
---
And a shitload of downvotes
---
The comment you are replying to explicitly talks about it being a Keleseth deck, of course this is wild.
---
Also the combo itself just doesnt work in Standard. Silver Vanguard is a Wild card
---
I hit Legend for the first time two months ago with Mecha'thun Warlock in Wild. I have been playing almost as long as you have (I think I started sometime before BRM). I'll just leave some thoughts about my climb and maybe it will be of use to you.
---
I really wanted to get the Legend cardback out of the way because I knew I was going to have less and less time with my baby child growing up and me starting a new job soon. 
---
The first thing I did was commit to playing more. Until then, I never was really motivated to play a lot, I mostly played two or three mateches a day and usually finished around rank 4 to 3. I still couldn't do a heavy grind for time restrictions and lack of motivation, but I definitely started to use almost all the spare time I had to play when I normally would have done something else. I guess I was at about 5-7 games a day.
---
After hitting rank 1 two months in a row playing various decks I tried to find a deck I really enjoyed playing and thought I could play for the larger part of a month without getting bored. The reasons I settled on M'thunlock were mostly the following:
---
1. I like a deck with a clear direction and purpose.
---
2. I can't play a lot of aggro, I get tilted fast. Decks with very short match durations at the cost of a lower overall winrate don't do it for me.
---
3. With M'thunlock I felt I could accurately analyse after each match what I did right or wrong. Doing that helped me prevent tilt after a loss since I was either able to point to mistakes I made that I could improve upon or chalk the loss up to bad RNG if I couldn't find any mistakes.
---
You will have noticed that I didn't pick a top meta deck for my climb, which would usually have been my first instinct. I tried not to obsess too much about tier lists and instead to find the deck I was personally most comfortable with.
---
I also made an effort to think more about my plays before I did them. I will never be the guy that ropes on the first turn to figure out whether I should play the one drop I have in hand or not, but I admit that many of the mistakes I do make are due to overly rushing my play.
---
On my legend climb I really felt I got in the zone at times when I was able to accurately predict my opponent's play lines and make the correct counter play. It made me feel like I deserved legend and that I would be able to get there if I just played enough.
---
I got to rank 1-1*, then made the mistake of switching to Odd Paladin and fell back to rank 3-0*. In the end I went to legend from there with about a 75% winrate playing M'thunlock again. Surely I got a bit lucky then, but by then I also really felt I knew everything I had to do against the most popular decks at the time like Odd Pally, Big Priest or Jade Druid, and I performed very well against them. I was just in tune with my deck.
---
If you got to rank 1 on multiple occasions, you know you can get to Legend. Good luck!
---
Mmmh, depends on the deck. OTKs? for sure! Control? Not so much.
---
Yeah otherwise it's way op
---
&gt; It's the immortal prelate's deathrattle, not the battlecry
---
Three quest slots really isn't a lot. I understand that having fewer slots rewards retention, which is good for Blizzards numbers, but it'd be nice if we could at least unlock more slots with progression.
---
It would also be nice if we had Weekly or even Monthly Quests that were a bit more involved. The closest things we have is Weekly Brawls which is always cleared in a single win, and Ranked play reward chest. I personally don't feel like these count because while Brawl does offer varied game play, the reward is minimal, and offers no real incentive to play after a single win. Doing well in Ranked on the other hand should be rewarded regardless, and climbing ladder can get rather boring very late into an expansion.
---
There are 3 factors to why pros are as successful as they are:
---
* Luck: You can't hit #1 Legend on merit alone, you have to play until you get that good streak that gets you there. No two ways about it. 
---
* Conscious effort: Crunching the numbers, researching everything, really putting in the time to know the ins-and-outs of the game. Will get you 2-3% advantage in wr. Just not worth it unless there's money in it, or you just really enjoy analyzing a children's card game as a second unpaid job. 
---
* Intuitive feel: This is the most important and hardest thing to learn. Your brain simply can't consciously process every single thing that's going on, no one's can. You HAVE to listen to your gut and your gut feeling has to be good. Alas, there's no direct, proactive way to train your gut. All you can do is play the game, keep in mind what's working and what isn't. Learn from your mistakes, learn from streamers and learn when you lost despite not making a mistake. Don't get tilted, being angry seriously impairs your logical reasoning abilities. Keep absorbing information, it's slow but it's the only way. Your conscious mind is really flexible but also crazy slow compared to your subconscious, which learns new things slowly but is incredibly fast at applying its knowledge.

Rastakhan was the worst for me. The solo part was very bad and new mechanics not really interesting. It makes me play less and less. The game going to all cartoon child style don't please me too. I don't understand what they want to do at the end for the game.

Yea exactly! Still takes me a couple games to get the feel of the deck haha. Seems like most arena decks have the tempo-ish vibe, idk if that’s just me.
---
Can anyone explain how the deck wins works? I hoped it was total server wins with that deck, but after playing against multiple merc 14 decks with only about 100 wins each (and a different amount of wins each), I would guess not.
---
Dude I love this deck. Had like 3 games where I drew Leviathan after their Patches turn.

That sine wave is making me curious. Where does this shape come from? Why is there always a drop follow by a spike?

How do you plan on playing Zul'jin in Arena? Or were you just talking about Constructed in a thread about Arena?

Something about you cant do that
---
I tried this earlier today, I played both Prelate and the 7 drop first before playing Undatakah, but after he died he didn't come back. Is it because Undatakah triggered the 7 mana "Recruit an 8 cost minion" deathrattle before triggering Immortal Prelate's deathrattle that it didn't work?
---
Expansion releases
---
I see your point. Could be he wanted to get the 10k once for bragging. 
---
Btw, play wild. Yes big priest is there. But you really face way more decks, that it is genuinely fun.
---

---
Cyclone isn't really combo, Mech Pally is midrange for sure. Luna's Mage can be considered combo but plays a bit more midrangey than control-combo decks usually do, still a control-combo I guess.
---
And that's because Blizzard hates combo decks and is working to remove them from the game. If you want I can give you examples....
---
Well combo decks play a control style and generally win the game vs. control, midrange loses to aggro generally since they can't grab the board as well and can't clear it as well as control can, however they usually beat control because they have more mana efficient and card efficient threats than aggro, not to mention they're bigger, and the decks generally have huge tempo turns, currently the best examples of those are Zul'jin and Kangor's Endless Army..
---
Midrange has a fair share of the decks right now IMO. Mage, Hunter, Mech Paladin and I guess Nomi Priest kinda? And like 1-2 Shaman decks. Aggro has Zoolock, Token Druid, Tempo Rogue, Murloc Shaman, Burn Shaman, Silence Priest and Mech Hunter. Control/combo has OTK Pally, Control Warrior, Control Shaman(kinda a deck idk), Luna's and that's basically it I think. To be fair, there's usually at most like only 3-4 commonly seen aggro decks(e.g., In Boomsday, Heal Zoolock, Odd Rogue, Odd Pally), now all of the ones I mentioned except maybe 1-2 I really commonly see... I'd say it's more or less aggro than midrange but there are still an abundance of Midrange decks, although overall Mage and Hunter are the two most common and the others not nearly as much so(for me).
---
Wild meta is fun if we ignore big priest but standard meta in the last month before the new expansion is the most boring thing in history of gaming. In that period I play only brawls and some adventures. Even the arena gets boring
---
As of right now, cyclone mage and luna mage is almost the same. They're combo decks that are able to outright win the game on turn 5.
---
It's not another chance, it's a sure thing right? The 3 new ones are added on after the 3 he kept from dying, so he has to do the second round's recruit after the first round's shuffle
---
I’ll have what he’s having.
---
[Usually when people talk about meta diversity they are talking about the length of time they can go before the game seems solved and becomes less interesting. The two things that impact this the most are the amount of cards we release, and the cadence in which we release them. In the past, some of our content releases only came with 30-45 cards, which we don't think ended up being enough card content to fill a 4-month window with enough interesting decks to explore. We landed on releasing 135 cards per expansion because it felt like enough content to last the full 4 months. Nowadays, as players are consuming the content faster we're trying a bunch of different ways to freshen things up around the 2-month mark. One of our first swings at that was the Rise of the Mech event, I would be curious if players think that releasing a small subset of cards during the 2-month timeline would be a good idea or not. We have a bunch of ideas that we're going to try over the new few expansions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/cb4fpp/hearthstone_saviors_of_uldum_ama_tuesday_july_9/etdp08a/?context=10)

Cyclone's more midrange than Combo, Luna is arguable for either.

---
Quite apart from the issue of making it necessary to buy the Adventure to get the cards, which Blizzard themselves acknowledged was unpopular, there's also the issue of the quality of the Adventure itself.
---
When the KotFT Adventure came out, Blizzard said that it was harder to complete than the previous Adventures, which had to be simple because players needed to finish them fairly quickly to get the cards. I wouldn't like to go back to the simpler format.
---
Hello silence my old friend...
---
I remember an arena run where I drafted 3 Tarim’s. I was playing against a warlock and he had managed to stay in the game (barely) past the first two. First Tarim was on curve, second was on 9 with like 4 minions on my board and 2 large minions on his. I still remember how long he sat there trying to process what just happened when I dropped the third Tarim on a board of tokens.
---
it's not about meta and warrior it's hearthstone developers that are refusing to improve the game and add many new features since 5 years (beta) they even promised it by themselves. 
---
Currently they use minimal effort and just release 100-200 new cards per 3 months and call it "development" that's disgusting. Meanwhile other games are addding new features and improving.
---
and Auto Battlers are the trend right now, most of HS streamers moved to them. You dont' pay 50$ for putting each chess piece on board there.
---
Wisp clearly op there
---
It wouldn't matter.  The game doesn't need more cards, it needs more ways to play with the ones we already have (new game modes).  I don't care if that's Tournament Mode, Co-Op Dungeon Run, 2v2, Pauper, Peasant, rotating Wild blocks of select expansions, Sealed Leagues, or whatever.  If there aren't new ways to play added the game will just slowly die, regardless of how often they release new content.
---
Also, I personally did not like the solo adventure this time and did not buy it (unpopular opinion I know).  Being forced to buy something I don't want in order to get cards for the metagame would suck.
---
For starters, you could tell them.
---
Secondly, they would see discrepancies in where the account logins from. So for example. If you are in Germany, and all of a sudden the account is popping up in Europe, they might get a bit suspect. What's more, anytime the person will have to do technical stuff, it could get really tricky. It just isn't worth the risk. You have nothing to lose, but the buyer absolutely does.
---
Those who have tech 1025, please play more to spread the glory to those of us trapped in the Merc 280 loop
---
I agree that Rogue, Mage, and Warrior are the big three that won't stop and Mage is the strongest (though I think the deck has a high skill cap and the circle jerk of "hur-dur it's all random card generation" is overblown).  Nevertheless Mage is probably too powerful right now, we'll see where it lands post expansion.  
---
The reason everyone whines about Warrior though is the games take forever so they get the most screen time.  If there is a Warrior mirror it's going to take 4 times as long as any other game, so when people casually flip through twitch and stop in on PlayHearthstone it looks like non-stop Warrior mirrors, even though it really isn't.  It just feels like it because they take so long.
---
I would shittalk you for making this post but thankfully the other redditors are doing that for me FeelsOkayMan
---
And specifically Warrior mirrors in specialist format, so up to 3 games per match, and some regions there were days where 90% of the matches were Warrior.
---
I’m usually someone who watches the full tournament VOD over the next week after its conclusion. But with GM, there was like 36 hours of content some weekends. 
---
I rather enjoyed the Masters tournament. Wish they just kept up with the HCT, maybe we’d still have Dog around.
---
Precisely! My first RoS legendary was khadgar. I despise mage so I disenchanted him too.

Lynchen 100%  makes me sad she isn't meta, but she is a really good card as an al around deck filled for decks with more battecries.

Thanks!

it was indeed Eye for an Eye, had to play around it for 5 turns because I only had big minions
---
havent finished yet, that was just the pic from my second game
---
Nah, I'm not a fan of it. It wasnt the most exciting set to me and the main mechanic was faily parasitic and repetitive.
---
Now, do the same without Hearth Arena...
---
Dude it’s a 0 mana 1/1 think of the value.
---
Like Mass Dispel. That's a cheap card... (/s)
---
Ignore the whiners, this drawing is sick!
---
I'm sorry if I upset you dude, it honestly wasn't my intention, I just wanted to state my opinion on the matter.  
---
I don't question that this opinion has been stated by other people, more famous than me. So if your definition of copying is saying anything that has been spoken or written before then I guess everyone using Reddit are copying, including me.
---
Hope I didn't ruin your day.
---
I want patches unnerved in wild. Or raza un nerfed
---
Yeah I think people who say it's just because of the current meta should look at the overall numbers going all the way back to 2016. 
---
Year over year, Twitch viewership has dropped. 2018 saw some incredibly low points like the Boomsday meta where the months of Sept/Oct/Nov were lowest viewership the game has had in years. The difference between those months in 2018 and 2017 is pretty staggering.
---
And then when rotation hit in April 2019 (when KFT/K&amp;C/Ungoro left the game), it was still significantly lower than April 2018, which was lower than April 2017. 
---
I put a lot of the blame of the current state of Hearthstone to the boring cards released in 2018.
---
It doesn't matter because secrets don't trigger on your turn. You're thinking you have the secret up and play Saboteur, your opponent casts a spell from Saboteur and your secret goes off right? Doesn't work.
---
It's like attacking a minion with a weapon with [[Eye for an Eye]] up. You take damage but the secret doesn't trigger because it's your turn. Or when you take fatigue damage on your own turn with [[Ice Block]] up and you die.

Was the point to take a popular priest card that ended up getting summoned by mages alot and then to circlejerk yourself and try to farm some karma while saying, "tHiS wOuLd bE a GoOd pRieSt caRd"?
---
Too long didn’t read

And I top decked mass dispell. This man was not lucky

I agree with everything except Edwin, he was a staple in tempo rogue which was the number 1 deck before the nerfs

So druids and warriors just win then?

All 3 see play in wild, where there is the most power creep. Using the argument that they didnt fit specific standard metas doesnt mean they were power crept at all.

Did you have a stroke writing this

That's only true for the first few rounds.  Higher wins have more variance so that you aren't waiting 20+ mins for a game

If they want to run majordomo I suppose so, you can always silence him

---
Why do I see enemy merc14 decks with roughly 54~ wins tho always?
---
When it has an upside it doesn't cost 0
---
I’m not saying it would be mechanically better for the class, but at least it would fit the class fantasy better and allow there to be a more appropriate class that regularly gets armor. And as a bonus, we never would have had to deal with an untouchable-Druid meta.
---
haven't seen them for a while… 15 rank is only Barnes and Vargoth…
---
They all probably inherited it from the same person that had just a bit fewer than 54 wins. Once the deck spreads around it stops getting more wins since it's all mirrors.
---
Still waiting for midrange paladin to come back
---
Generic advice to anyone entering the meta for the first time, you don't have to drop real money to run real decks.
---
There are incredible tools for finding what decks you can make for cheap. Go to hsreplay.net, link your Blizzard account to them and download hearthstone deck tracker. Yes, its a legit site. Hundreds of thousands of HS players use it daily. Once deck tracker is up and running, open my collection in game and HDT will upload your collection to HSR.
---
Then go back to HSR. Go to 'decks' and sort by name. It will list every deck it tracks and how much dust you'd need to spend to complete it, as well as the win rate of the deck and the number of matches recorded. Look for at least 1k matches, preferably 5k.
---
From there, dust bad cards and make good decks! If you have a question on a particular card, look it up on HSR as well. Anything used in less that .1% of decks is a pretty safe dust and you'd be amazed on how much dust you're sitting on.
---
As to what changed?  A lot of new cards and a few new keywords.  Rush, Lifesteal as SoB outlined, as well as twinspell.  A twinspell creates a copy of the spell when cast, but the copy won't have twinspell.
---
&gt;they just do the least amount needed to keep the gullible playerbase buying packs every new expansion
---
Come off of it, people on this subreddit get upvoted for saying they're buying packs and the mods, you, and any other person who wants to complain are just as guilty.
---
Where's your post calling out those who tolerate a shitty game? A game with a "shitty economy" or with "shitty balancing"? As I said, you and every other person bitching in this thread or other threads sure has a lot of shit to talk about Blizz but you just kindly dismiss the players on here who have done quite a bit to condone and even ENCOURAGE Team 5's behavior!
---
After all, think about it. If you see an indie developer and you buy their game, won't they be happy someone decided to give their hard-earned money to check it out? The same applies all the way up the ladder, to some extent. The people still investing money are, one way or another, having some modicum of fun/entertainment.
---
Even casuals are. And I'm not DEFENDING them. But my point is, if Team 5 sees these people investing and spending money, then of course they're going to listen to them. These players are the ones happily voting with their wallets for more of what they're already getting because the game makes them happy.
---
And you might say "Well why would I go after them"/"Well it's pointless to try" but I've seen mindsets like yours all across gaming. No-one wants to try and take on casuals or people who don't seem to give a fuck. Even though these individuals are on places like Reddit too and again, they get upvoted! This will be the future of MORE games if you just let this shit slide and go with this nonsense defeatist "the glory days are over" attitude.
---
Edwin never really left. Like ever. Maybe some weird big rogue in wild or something doesn’t run him.
---
Rule 34?
---
No, Krush would not see any play in warrior because if it's a. Aggro warrio, it's too slow b. Control warrior, why would you run a charge card? Especially since Omega Devastator and most of the rush package is better for trading c. Combo/Otk warrior...just run Grom. Krush's biggest problem is that's an Aggro card way too expensive for aggro to play and requires a lot of ticks from Thaurissan or at least a single Scarlet webweaver to enable some sort of combo cause since a (9) 8/8 wasn't fast enough almost 5 years ago, it won't be today either

&gt; Jade druid was at a 40-50% playrate during KFT at one point. Not because it was such a fun and beloved deck people loved to play, but because it was insanely OP. Then after the nerfs it still remained a highly played deck because a large portion of people hadnt adapted yet.
---
umm no? [at its peak](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-62/), the druid class was at about 30-40% but that was equally split between jade and aggro. Jade druid topped out at 20% or so. still oppressive but not to the rate you are describing. After its nerf, it also pretty quickly settled out to about 8% of the meta. 
---
&gt;And they even nerfed Rogue several times over, and the main anti res priest deck kingsbane rogue because it was "unfun to play against" whilst never being as dominant as res priest was.
---
&gt;Theyre obviously two faced when it comes to this
---
These decks were also in standard at time of nerf. I think its more a case of they are less okay with these strategies being in standard (especially since they had a higher win rate there) then they are in wild.
---
Search "extra" in your collection to filter it by cards you have too many copies of. If you have enough regular playable copies of a card (1 for legendaries, 2 for other rarities) and 1 or 2 golden copies, you should disenchant the golden copies for the most dust. For the same reason, you should disenchant 1 golden copy of a non legendary card if you have 2 golden and 1 regular copy of it. Any golden cards you don't have enough regular copies of should only be disenchanted for the same reasons you would disenchant regular cards (not duplicates) for:
---
a) you desperately need the dust and the card is not that good
---
b) you know for a fact that you won't play the card enough for it to be worth the dust (more dust from golden cards is relevant here): 
---
* it only sees play in decks you don't like and probably won't ever craft
---
* it only sees play in extremely expensive decks you probably won't craft any soon
---
* it's not a staple in any deck, you can play decks that use it without the card (risky, it could become a staple some day) 
---
* the card is just useless and doesn't have any potential to be good in the future even with new cards (very hard to judge)
---
Do **not** disenchant cards if:
---
a) it's a legendary which you could open again:
---
* do not disenchant classic legendaries unless you really have to
---
* do not disenchant legendaries from packs you will still be buying
---
b) you aren't using the dust immediately, it's better to know how much dust the cards you wanna disenchant are worth, keep them and only disenchant them right before crafting something
---
Then "Silence" the card will be powercreeped. Maybe make it 2 mana(if at most 2 minions) and it costs more with every minion added after 2.
---
\\\ Kappa /
---
I'd legit put him in decks if i had him. Insane value
---
It has an upside in that it’s a 0 mana card that draws a card and can do anything else. If even if it’s not free either, 1 mana silence a minion draw a card is still quiet good.
---
send to me the exact same thread
---
Crafting commons and uncommons if you have the dust isn't a bad idea, as you'll be using those a lot in decks (of course skipping the obviously bad ones)
---
0 mana draw a card is an upside

Few people offered here that they will spectate you, I saw some coach here too - I think it's you best next step to pinpoint the issue.  
---
75% sounds little low but it depends, they are no gods, they make mistakes too, they also have different tendencies, there are often few equally good plays - its more about getting you to think why their play was different. Generally you got plenty of good tips here, I agree with almost all of them,  one thing I didn't saw and could help is watching your replays. Doing it next day with fresh mind after big lose streak could help you understand what's happening. But as I said at the beginning, getting others (good players - preferably that are experienced with deck you are playing ) to spectate your games is what you should do now. You have correct mindset, I believe you will get there, good luck!

It vanished from the scene when the balance changes happened.
---
It is a really cute dog🥰
---
oh is this casual then?
---
&gt; its the consumers fault and the company takes less blame for forcing out a bad game
---
It's the fault of those who TOLERATE the people who support a "bad game" or "bad company". 
---
And yes I do believe you are to blame if you are dissatisfied but you aren't even trying to help the problem. If you're not going to ATTEMPT to try and get people to stop supporting companies, why keep complaining?
---
Blizzard wouldn't "force out bad games" if they thought people were going to refuse to buy it. Like, a company putting out bad games can only do so for as long as they get money for it! Otherwise they'd go bankrupt! They rely on consumers feeding them. As I said, consumers don't make the decisions for companies but they DO reinforce them which is equally-important.
---
If Blizzard released the newest expansion and announced a 50% price hike and people complained, and suddenly profits PLUMMETED, do you think Blizzard would just ignore that because "grr bad greedy company"? No! They'd step back! Their reason for doing so might be self-serving, but the point is to manipulate them in a way that benefits us too.

(Actually because of power creep, not in terms of stats/value, but in terms of synergy/mechanics (to make money).)
---
Putting a bad 12 cost card in the pool would feel really bad. It’d be too swingy/toxic RNG imo. “Buffing” Grace Horror to 11 mana is perfect, since it’s unfair that Mage has such a powerful defensive option on turn 6 with Giant &gt; Conjurers, earlier with the coin

This also happens against all aggro decks if you haven't drawn the exact card you need. Why is it different?
---
It also has a high play rate because it feels wild, you use Big Wild Legendaries like Ragnaros and Y'shaarj.
---
Actually I think they might not run rag anymore but still
---
Yeah those '5 expansions' really only one or two of them have cards people 'need'
---
Any  game that players have to spend $150 when they start out to 'catch up' is fucking bullshit.

---
Yeah I agree that they should keep free legendaries free at any point in time into a rotation. I don't get why they think it's bad to give it to new players passed an event. If anything it incentivizes them to keep playing.
---
As for everything else, not sure what to tell you. If you're a player that can almost reach legend, I feel like all the things you are complaining about should've been obvious to expect. It's unfortunate, but what model could they possible put in place for someone who played before and is now returning? 
---
I could see reasoning in the idea of giving all the legendary quests players received from each expansion that is currently in Standard. Like, there were a lot of opportunities for free rise of shadows packs this expansion. I don't see why they couldn't give the quests for Witchwood, Boomsday, Rastakhans, and RoS. This way any new player has a chance to get like 10+ packs from each expansion. I seriously doubt this would affect sales for blizzard in a negative way. If anything, it would get new players using the new cards and want to buy and more.
---
"good luck"
---
Even that has flaws though. Decks built around a certain synergy or payoff are draw dependent to a degree.
---
Why? Guaranteed (good) cards, guaranteed legendaries, singleplayer content. The price of old adventures is the same since launch (5$ per wing).
---
Is that expensive?
---
Compared to other games? Maybe.
---
Compared to prices of packs and normal expansions? That's a great value deal.
---
It is isnt it?
---
Also, these cards are probably being played much more often in a positive game state.  I think this is an example of correlation != causation.
---
I disenchanted both my Ultimate Infestations because I was thinking why would you ever want to draw 5 cards, that's bound to overdraw!
---
What’s so impressive?
---
What are you talking about, Krush was always one of the worst classic legendaries and only got played for a little while recently
---
1. There's a thread for that
---
2. U didn't even include Ur battletag
---
3. Your account is hours old, u want people to go first despite creating a new account here and not even reading the rules? Not to mention the whole thread sounds like a weak scam attempt
---
This is absolutely gorgeous! Great work!
---
If a card is 5 stars its shaping the meta though. 1 star implies that it's so unbelievably trash that it will never see play in any meta. If Blizzard ends up pushing this tempo identity for priest then Lazul could be a pretty good part of that deck
---
The "*prediction of the near future*" part is when he does the first [trump reviews before the meta is devoleped](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvEIxIeBRKSiFjMBxpQOud8d5X4Resdeb). This is the re-review and the stars are for the current ongoing meta. Dont think trump does more than 2 layers of reviews (unless some big patch happens during a season).
---
Yes it is. People saying stuff like "you can unpack another millhouse if you DE him": then you disenchant him again. Plus if you don't have many classic legendaries its very unlikely. I would personally d/e pit lord, millhouse and gladiator's right away. Batterhead is played sometimes in fringe decks like muckmorpher shaman, plot twist warlock and Big paladin. Betrug is only played in plot twist warlock, so I'd consider disenchanting him as well. But since the expansion is coming so soon, you should actually wait to see if your cards find some use.
---
Aggro shamans and pirate warriors have shaped not just the kft meta but several metals before that. Hyper aggression was the norm. 2 mana cards were HIGHLY valued at that time. You are just being super greedy if you think you could survive with a single 2 cost card in your deck. The was the rationale for not expecting it to see play. And it was correct. It saw no play because you are indeed being super greedy trying to get away with a single 2 drop in a pirate warrior meta.
---
The nerfs made way for a slower meta that made keleseth possible. If people though keleseth would not see play whatsoever keleseth would have never taken off. It's because people recognised keleseth had value after the nerfs that keleseth decks started to rise after the nerfs.
---
I guess, however if it is always good to draw in a specific deck then the card is just good imo. Even if it is a deck catered towards it. Like how prince-2 decks were highly synergistic of him, and thus he had a high winrate (since he was bonkers).
---
Read my examples again. I'm talking about cards that reward you for having beasts and non-beasts on the board. These would synergize with the first two cards you have listened. Being able to make more different types of decks that aren't purely beast dominate, like you have mentioned with Master's Call, would be the goal of such cards.
---
compared to other games? sure
---
compared to other Card games? Hell no.
---
In Games like Yugioh or Pokemon (the Cardgames) you pay up to 70-100 Euro for a new Meta deciding Card. Check how much the Top Meta Decks are worth.
---
I'm with ya, i think the predictions were good for Keleseth for the expansion launch. If the nerfs never happened, Prince 2 would've never seen tier 1 play.

Just getting into some Hearthstone, it's pretty fun actually I think.  Hope I get better. LOL

Its from rise of shadows. It came out somewhere in the middle of rise of the shadows not from the first day of release

Well yeah, it wouldn't hurt to get the quest for the free legendary... But I did expect that and most of the time you get a crappy legendary anyway.

What really bugs me is snip snap, not only it was free but it is also extremely powerful and ubiquitous.

compared to other games? sure compared to other Card games? Hell no. In Games like Yugioh or Pokemon (the Cardgames) you pay up to 70-100 Euro for a new Meta defining Card. Like Dr. Boom. But you also need 3 Copys of it.

Check how much the Top Meta Decks are worth.
