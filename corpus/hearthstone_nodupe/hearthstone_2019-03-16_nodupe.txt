Is there any plans to add a system where the deck builder will make a deck including cards you don’t have but do have the dust to craft?

How do you get the most bang for your buck with pre orders? From my understanding you get the exact opposite from most games. You pay extra in most cases for a useless cosmetic item and run the risk of the game being a flop because you didn't even get to see it's reviews. (Star Wars Battlefront 2 was the last preorder ever for me)
---
Especially in the case of AAA games, most of the time you wait a few months and you can get the entire game plus DLCs for the same price or less than the pre-order price.
---
As for Hearthstone, you may get some extra packs and a skin but that comes at the price of not knowing the full card list or even the new mechanic introduced before you pay.
---
Without interfering with your draw pool
---
The wild west of week 1 of a new expansion will be his only chance to shine, use it wisely 
---
You got what you wanted.
---
forbidden mechanic is super restricting on when you can play it, by forcing you to play it last, so i dont see it outright replacing it.
---
Personally I don't mind boring keywords. Twinspell as a keyword is very boring, just like Rush as a keyword is very boring. But that means there's a lot of flexibility in card design that uses these keywords.
---
The Forest's Aid is honestly a solid example to me of an interesting card -- notably because of its power level. It's two board threats in one card to risk Savage Roar, alongside great Treant synergy (looking at you, Mulchmuncher).
---
Basic/boring design does not necessarily make the cards that use the mechanic boring.
---
I knew it was a visual error but not what caused ut, so thanks for explaining! 
---
Wow look at me maining Rogue now
---
still weird that they didn't set it to auto sort out Baku
---
A, B, C sure. D? No
---
To each their own. I avoid buying packs at the start of the expansion because the first month of a new expansion is the most prime time to play Arena. 
---
By the end of the first month I have a mountain of packs from Arena to open for when I want to start playing standard.
---
This is really good stuff man, please do more
---
Recruit is not used *as a keyword,* but do remember that Y'Shaarj, Captain Hooktusk, and Finja are all examples of cards in other expansions that have nearly identical functionality to Recruit (the difference being that those cards summon the minions to the right of them, whereas Recruit always summons minions to the right side of the board).
---
Plus, both Recruit and Inspire both had their healthy mix of powerful cards:
---
Thunder Bluff Valiant
---
Nexus-Champion Saraad
---
Call to Arms (when nerfed)
---
Oaken Summons
---
Oh I'm sure that's the case, I just thought it was a funny implication I hadn't noticed before.

For weirder/less good decks like buff pally and dragon pally (as well as minion mage, discard Warlock, and token druid) it won't build those decks for you. What you want to do is build most of the deck yourself, and if you don't know what else to add, then use auto fill.

As someone into statistics and Machine Learning, I'd love to see how you guys do this behind the scenes! I can't imagine it's simple, considering some of these bugs.

Glad to see Hearthstone implementing this technology in their game, it definitely isn't the usual test case. 
---
Damn that was quick. Good job
---
I really like the smart deck builder and hope it can work decently with smaller sample sizes for the memedeck community :).
---
Could we one day get some more detailed insight into it's fubction that would be really interesting and helpful for using it correctly. 
---
So for example, I put Lynessa in my deck and autocompleted it and it built me a constructed Odd Paladin deck with two Blessing of Might as the only buff spells.
---
Like, I get that Odd Paladin is best performing deck on ladder and shoving Lynessa in it with no variation might be the "best winrate deck", but that wasn't really the direction I was hoping the deckbuilder would go.
---
I didnt even know that was a thing, and it sounds amazing. 
---
That well played emote is hardcore BM

I love it

Hi Brian, you seem like you know your mill decks! It has been awhile since i played mill rogue but would love to try again. Mind sharing your deck list or pointing me to one? Cheers!
---
Dumb question, I started playing in Frozen Throne. What happened to War axe?
---
When I put in 20 cards from a control paladin deck, it autocompletes with things like Lost in the Jungle, Dire Wolf Alpha, and Divine Favor. Surely that can't be right, I own more appropriate cards than those.

Statistically they over-estimate everything when you take into account how few cards see play every expansion.

Pinata, Seance, Undatakah, Stonehill. Add some Spirit of the Dead and Bwonsamdi. Pretty fun IMO. 
---
Experimenting a lot and noticed Zerek's Cloning Gallery is very good to, 7 1/1 on the board, usually get 1-2 Spirit of the Dead. If not or afraid for some spells or battlecries that deal 1 dmg AoE, summon a spirit (0/3) and then Zerek Cloning Gallery.
---
Hey how's that feel?
---
I think Rogue has completely over-taken Priest as the 'fun' and 'meme' class these days. It's been that way for awhile now. My first golden hero was Priest, and just recently my second golden hero is Rogue. Glad to see the continuation of these fun-type cards continuing in Rogue. I'm pretty excited! Nomi and Hopper decks better be at least decent!
---
Surprised to see no mention of Malygos here. I love seeing all the different combos people come up with for it.
---
A little biased since Maly Rogue is my favorite deck.
---
Preorders for digital content are a joke.  
---
I see your point but all I was trying to say is a lot of people have said "hey If you want the Hero skin just pay fo the 80 doller bundle" but people cant afford that I get that some can't even pay for the 50 Bundle but in that case why not have a minimum bundle that includes the skin and a few packs. If it is "just a cosmetic" as you put it then surely those who were going to buy 80 packs would have done so anyway
---
Didn't you post on this already?
---
If you're absolutely sure it isn't your fault, do before/during/after screenshots and raise it through Blizzard support.
---
I just don't pre-order. it's not worth it.
---
I guess you could call it, "no pre-order until they give me something worth my money" :)
---
I don't have any mantra like that but I can say it is upsetting that the put such little effort into the UI and giving us different in game experiences
---
In Wild, yes, but the Blazecaller rotates out in April when this card is available, so this won't be a Standard strategy.
---
What about pally hero power? That’s infinite but Hagatha is so so much better. Infinite is irrelevant. It’s all about power level: Rexxar, Jaina, Guldan &gt;&gt; Hagatha, Boom, Zuljin &gt; regular
---
Hah, that's fair.  The last time I preordered was Witchwood.  I wasn't going to, but the 70 pack deal was pretty sweet.  Still wasn't going to, but then Amazon ran a special and I could get the pre-order for $40 and I cracked :D.  I didn't regret it since it was going to be in Standard for a full 2 years, but yeah, these newer ones seem really lackluster.
---
Luckily for me, no hero portrait would ever give me the motivation to play priest. 
---
I like it. Its about whether its fun to play with for a long time, not whether or not its super flashy and exciting for the week after release.
---
I don't think I could not have fun with a Mayor Noggenfogger on board.
---
A personal favorite is Shifter Zerus. The potential to play any minion in the game and get its effect in full, and have control over when you pull the trigger, makes it a very unique and versatile RNG card with some insane potential.
---
Also, this might seem like a weird pick, but despite being kind of boring on the surface, Zola the Gorgon has been one of the most satisfying cards to play for me since it came out. I guess it's less about what IT does and more about what the minions you copy do....but that's the thing - she lets you cheat the cap of 2 copies in a deck (or 1 for Legendaries), allowing for plays you otherwise could never make. One of my favorite combos in Wild Handbuff Paladin is Brann Bronzebeard + [[Grimestreet Outfitter]] (for +2/+2 to your hand) and then playing Zola on the Outfitter, putting two more of them in your hand. Makes for a pretty beefy hand. I'm just a sucker for value and card advantage, honestly.

I guess I've a simpler mantra...

No preorder == good preorder
---
It is. I look at that art and I see so many different permutations of possible cards, for example: Snipers, dwarves, hunters, beasts, a gun, but never silence. 
---
Owls in Secret of Mana (by Square™) would confuse you but that is the end of my knowledge of the lore. 
---
Still looking to trade?
---
And thus the pogo just kept on hopping.
---
Really?
---
Because, like I said, the skin is obviously a compelling incentive. It makes it easier for people to justify purchasing the larger bundle. If they made skins more accessible, the incentive for the larger bundle would diminish.
---
I get that it sucks (it basically means I'll probably never get a new skin from now on), but I really can't blame them for selling them this way. There's no real incentive for them to make them more accessible.
---
You can't spend this, nor you can disenchant more cards

Agreed but I have seen the if you want the cosmetics just buy the 80 bundle comments but that is just as stupid an argument as the $80 for a cosmetic is unfair" as its not true.

My argument is more people should not be denied a thing just because they could not afford the bigger thing. you don't take away someones car because they did not get the sports package put on it.

Khadgar and Vereesa will be defending Dalaran!

---
Bro you’re not casual, the only thing I’ve ever bought is black rock mountain adventure, I’ve never oreordered any expansion. Save about 5k gold per expansion and get ~50 packs and start saving for the next expansion.
---
Also dust almost all cards from rotating sets to have dust to craft new things
---
nothing has seemingly been announced regarding free stuff on launch yet but I imagine we will get that info on the Official Reveal Stream when that happens.
---
They can be, but are in many cases held because it's inconvenient to upgrade them straight away or there's a key swing moment to drop the upgraded Spellstone. And, ultimately, it's the actual strength of the Spellstone as a card that determines whether it's a good inclusion or not, not anything inherent to the mechanic. 
---
Even if you don't feel Hagatha's or Toggwaggle's schemes are especially good at this stage in speculation, I would hesitate to characterize Schemes as categorically bad unless Blizzard proves it just doesn't want to make a worthwhile effect for one. Again, for all we know, we're currently looking at the Warrior/Paladin Spellstone equivalents, and Boom's Scheme (or whatever) is the Hunter's Spellstone equivalent.
---
Jaleynd#1878 NA trading.
---
I'll show you go first
---
Yeah. 
---
I always thought that stuff was more of an homage or reference to gurubashi. Also I think there's other troll tribes mentioned in the set(not sure though).
---
Isn't the story like Rastakhan is calling fighters from all over Az? 
---
The pre-release stuff will be the 3 Mammoth packs that has already been announced.
---
Everything else will be post-release. From the press fact sheet:
---
&gt; Starting April 5, just before Pre-Release, players can simply login to claim the free Legendary card and begin using it immediately in Play Mode and at Pre-Release events. At launch, a quest chain will become available that rewards multiple card packs for the Rise of Shadows and Year of the Raven expansions.
---
This video was made in collaboration with Displate
---
Thats kind of their point no? The recent hero cards were more balanced because there was only one hero card in those set to balance instead of nine. 
---
I had a similar experience, but, I realized, i obviously know some core cards that would make the combo deck work, so malygos plus razorpetal, I bet if you started from those cards you would get a different deck than if you started with just maly
---
Cries in "bought stock right before Blizzcon"

Congrats!

Show me the ~~money~~ Kobolds and Knights!
---
Nice
---
Yes, not only Lunara and Maiev but also Arthas (during the Year of the Mammoth was a great incentive for all players to earn by playing the game albeit being quite challenging to acquire it).
---
Yes I did preordered back then to support the great new efforts (after the debacle with Tyrande) of introducing new ways to earn an alternate hero portrait (Maiev and Lunara's system was quite friendly to new players and also players who are unable to shell out much of their income because it encouraged them to continue to play the game and they will be rewarded.
---
Currently I am quite disappointed (especially on behalf of the new players) when it's announced that there are no new hero that can be obtained by just playing the game for the Year of the Dragon (not pre-purchasing the bundles and getting the hero from it). 
---
I suppose this would be the new monetization method going forward this year. This may be true unless if there are some surprises in store for the upcoming solo adventure that is set to release on the month of May.
---
Well you may say that it is just a cosmetic product (alternate hero portraits) and what matters is the cards. Yes I agree with that but you have to remember that the cards released each year will be rotating at the end of two years into wild mode (making it inaccessible for players who are solely concentrating in standard mode of gameplay). 
---
What remains permanent here, not affected by rotation are the hero portraits (unlike the hero cards that come with powerful battlecry, hero powers and new ways of playing the game but are affected by rotation).
---
I sometimes play a The Darkness rogue deck which utilizes Spirit of the Shark and Augmented Elekks to finish the requirements (fairly) consistently.
---
Even with all of that, I've never actually "pulled it off". My opponent either has an answer for it, or instantly concedes if it's lethal. I've never actually had the opportunity to hear the attack sounds for that card...
---
So they want to make pogo hopper rogue a tier s archetype

Golden Wiz bang
---
I honestly hope you're wrong, unless we get *that* specific legendary and on launch another random class one. Otherwise, it would be a let down to just have another meme legendary that will probably see play just around the pre-release and that cannot be disenchanted. If nothing else, I at least hope they change the restriction of not being able to disenchant those specific cards they give out. I find it illogical, especially with Marin's case because some people had him regular and golden which is an absolute waste. Additionally, we already have one confirmed legendary that cannot be disenchanted (the golden Zayle).
---
You're just a bad netdecker then lol.
---
Thrall's the original Green Man 
---
At least you avoid disappointment and negative feedback
---
Yet it was nowhere near tier 1, and it’s debatable if treants became the staple.
---
It will still shoehorn the cards into another popular archtype, like Secret Paladin. In practice this feature does nothing more than give you approximatioms of the 2-3 most popular meta decks that you already know, it really won’t tell you about any «new» decks no matter how many cards you add to tilt it. You can add 14 deathratlle cards and it will still just try to smash them intoi to a Wall Priest.
---
I wish we could ban 1 hero portrait of choice.

Hunter may very well end up being the best class to use twinspell cards in considering they have Zul'jin for that sweet extra value.  
---
Most players are not interested in playing wild
---
-&gt; change that
---
A lot of functionally identical cards are completely separate internally. I noticed a while ago that some Warlock Imp tokens from different cards with identical name and art had different attack sounds. Even hero skins technically all have separate hero powers from their default counterparts, just with the same name, text, image, function, and pretty much everything else besides the animations.
---
In fact, are you sure the difference here was Baku vs Justicar, and not say, Magni vs Garrosh? I tried Garrosh with both Baku and Justicar, and they both gave me the same one - ID AT_132_WARRIOR. Icons for both looked like the bottom icon in your image. Magni on the other hand would actually need a separate upgraded hero power to match his separate starting hero power, in order to retain its unique animation.
---
I'll be honest... The dungeon run format has run its course for me.  I want the old school adventure formats back. But I totally understand that this isn't new player friendly. So I won't hold my breath.

Gah. Yeah, I can see why it blindsided me, then. It's a diminuitive given special rules because it's almost idiomatic over there.

It is indeed Mithril Plating and a Human upgrade. The Arcanite Armour has a round shield icon.
---
Warrior in its current state is holding all the tools it needs to build a solid deck. Hunter however only has bits and pieces of a deck. So Hunter is completely at the mercy of the cards released this set.
---
Meaning Warrior will be able to get something off the ground regardless of what comes out here. Hunter is 50/50 at best. Basically the only way that hunter can pull out of this, is if it gets another solid 2 drop, and a 1 drop, that both happen to be beasts. That way it could keep playing the Midrange deck.

FLYRICE#11845 trade

Karma for playing zoo.
---
Deck builder isn't working on build. I agree it's working as intended.
---
It's not really about meta being stale.
---
Odd paladin with 1 dead card has a higher winrate than any wonky kangor deck, so the builder gives you that, even if you put it kangor.
---
Same thing happens with warlock/rogue quest, duskfallen aviana and many other "unplayable" cards.
---
I'm in serious trouble.

That's weird, it's like they didn't want people to read it? Shame because it's a a good analysis, makes me excited for the rotation.

I just looked at your chanel, I didn't watch any videos. But completely based of the titles and the thumbnails I would never ever watch any of them. Embarrassing.
---
&gt;  If I ask HSReplay what I can do with my warrior cards it no joke says I need 5,000 dust to get over a 50% winrate.
---
This misconception is too common on the sub. I don't know what rank you are, but it's enough to be able to reach dumpster legend to take a "pauper" deck past the 50% winrate line in the lower rank brackets. 
---
Non-competitive players tend to overvalue how important having specific legendaries or epics is. The gap in skill is much more important than the gap in collection size in the lower ranks. Having something like The Glass Knight over Chillwind Yeti in an even paladin deck is under 1% winrate (you need to draw the knight and it needs to matter which four drop) difference. Mis-sequencing or taking the wrong role in the same match-up will net you a lot more.
---
A good player playing a generic "curvestone" deck will be over 50% against poor players piloting full-fledged meta decks. Collection matters a lot less than you think.
---
That being said, the new deckbuilder is indeed great.
---
No.

Or you can just get 3200 dust by doing nothing.

On my girlfriends account it made a pretty good aggro druid deck with her limited collection. But it added Keleseth together with some 2-drops.

They don't need to change dust costs of wild cards, just make wild packs purchasable with gold and lower the cost of a pack to 80g. It's not a lot less, but I think it's enough difference that more players would get into wild.

I own activision stock, and I also trade stocks as a hobby.
---
Blizzcon did not help, that is for sure, and around 3-10% of that drop may have been because of that. But the overall trend had to do with a number of factors.
---
1. The market took a dump on tech stocks. Blizzard is a tech stock.
---
2. FortNite hype. FortNite is like the game of the year as far as general trends are concerned. Any gaming company that is not FortNite in 2018 was colloquially deemed inferior by investors.
---
3. Earnings report and meeting analysts predictions. I am sure Activision has good years and bad years like every company. I am not sure if Activision objectively had a bad year, but if they had a bad month, especially during the tech sell off, that could compound an investors incentive to sell.
---
Personally, almost every stock I buy, I plan on owning for a few years at least, so the 30% drop (relative to what I bought the stock at) is not a big deal for now.
---
That's his point. Top tier meta will stay the same. But all levels below it will now get people playing mixes of them they can afford from sheer ease and convenience of putting one together.
---
They will absolutely not. Screw Jaina, screw Gul’dan and screw Rexxar.
---
Agreed! Never go Full Leeroy unless you have Lethal.
---
I don't think it would actually get more players into wild. If you haven't opened wild packs before it might be worth buying them to get the guaranteed legendary within the first 10 packs, but beyond that it'd be pretty pointless to open most wild packs. So many of those cards aren't used in wild that you'd feel like you're getting nothing but pack filler every time. 
---
The best way to get meta-viable wild cards would still be to craft the ones you need. 
---
Nah I tried make auto hunter deck and the suprise it worked in ranked very well 60% winrate.

Decreasing the functional price of a good may increase the number of people buying said good. However, the amount of revenue generated from those new buyers at the new price point may be less than the amount loss from those who would have bought anyway at the older, higher pricepoint.
---
For example, if functionally decreasing the price of packs by roughly forty percent only attracts an additional thirty percent of buyers over the last expansion, then that would result in a roughly twenty percent drop of revenues.
---
Firebat: more arms!
---
Every Villain in Leauge
---
Yeah maybe, just tryed doing a warlock with lakari, clutch mother, and soularium with no luck. Didn’t put 1 discard card in it. 
---
You might have to give it like a 5-10 card head start if your trying something like this? Idk
---
Yep, never got that logic regarding HS.
---
"I paid 200$ to get all my cards, lowering their price robs me"
---
Like did someone force you to buy everything 3 years ago?
---
You played them for 3 years already.
---
What do you gain if another player doesn't have these cards?
---
It just doesn't make any sense.
---
Pretty sure they fixed this. 
---
Or if you don't play wild check now how much dust you get if you dust all cards from rotating expansions now and make golden baku or/and genn for 1600 dust profit. Just dust all rotating cards few days untill rotate and craft all HoF cards golden what you can from highest profit to commons. 
---
or you can just craft regular copies of both, if you are 100% sure you will not get the dust by the time they are rotating
---
As an evolve shaman player of ye-olde days It annoys me when people attack before evolving all their minions despite potential extra damage.
---
In this case he could have rolled the blazecaller into a [[Cauldron elemental]] to buff Al'akir by +2 attack for lethal in place of one of the few charge minions.
---
These are the moves that you'd expect from legend rank players.
---
i like the classic card back icon better

8/7/7 Elemental | Your other Elementals have +2 Attack.  
---
Care to elaborate?
---
I think it creates the deck procedurally, so the overall deck is heavily influenced by the first 4 or 5 cards it chooses, which can vary since I don’t have Baku and there aren’t too many other cards for Rogue that are meta-defining right now, especially since rogue is one of the less popular classes at the moment.
---
I think it should have a decent amount of data though.  Paladin no longer gets meme-tier trash decks when you try to build something with Shirvallah, so it’s definitely been updating its data.
---
I don’t want you peasants getting stuff for cheaper than I did 
---
80g Trade quest on EU

OwlRevolver#2529
---
Well it depends on the remaining cards rogue and the other classes get.
---
This is nothing but meaningless speculation.
---
Warlock in aggor and priest meta noice
---
Drakkari enchanter works 
---
Man, your post doesn’t make sense!
---
Would be cool if you get legend, you get a random cardback you missed from a previous season, or a golden promo card or hero you missed if you have a high legend streak.
---
I have same issue
---
Why do people think a lot of cards in the format somehow increases the amount of cards required for a deck.
---
Wild probably works out cheaper long because the decks are more static without rotations.
---
That’s mostly correct but sometimes you will need to play Leeroy as removal to not die, or there are very fringe cases where you’ll be more incentivised to play Leeroy not to find lethal if for example you’re playing against big priest and want to pollute their resurrect pool.
---
There was a glitch with the legendaries given for the pre order bundles. They were giving people current standard eligible legendaries now instead of RoS legendaries on release day. Someone here apparently had every legendary so instead of giving him a duplicate it gave me the Darius Crowley hero card from some adventure. He put it in a deck and used auto fill, and it put in some wild cards. He was able to play standard ladder, it automatically picked the passive treasure to have a new random weapon equipped whenever his weapon broke, and when he played Darius it had battlecry: deal 5 damage to all minions, gave him the cannon permanent, and hero power: if your cannon kills a minion refresh this. 
---
There’s a post on this sub, and Kripp highlighted it in a video too. Pretty crazy stuff. 
---
Guy was given the Darius Crowley Hero Card from Monster Hunt to use. Let him throw wild cards into his deck with the autocomplete tool as well I think.
---
Have you ever tried hunter
---
No and the reason they'll give is that the second copy of the spell you get has a different name and therefore it's slightly different and would be confusing to new players. 
---
Surely the input isnt the total cards, but cards used? 
---
I'm suspicious of how fast the deck builder works even in standard though, especially when you start to screw with it - I suspect it's more like Whizbang than anything truly smart 
---
&gt; Then people would just buy old packs to dust for new cards. It would throw off the economy of the game.
---
Some $ is more than 0
---
Especially because it’s all basically the same post. Someone puts one card in and expects it to make them whatever deck they want. 
---
If you put in one odd card, the highest win rate cards for Pally are all odd cards, so it’ll make you an odd deck. 
---
These all just feel like such useless posts 
---
No, because strictly extra arms doesn’t add a copy of itself. It adds a different spell called ‘more arms’ which happens to have the same effect.
---
Firdt time is epic, gz man. Got a deck code for me?
---
Already got regular copies of them from packs (or maybe I crafted them ages ago) and I have enough to craft one in golden. 
---
at 80gold it would still be less gold for same dust. So would be point.
---
This looks like an awesome boss fight.
---
They don't need a partnership, they have acess to the same stats and beyond.
---
If my collection is worth exactly $0 then why are people asking to lower the cost of Wild to make it more accessible?
---
no downvote but the posts with i "i hit legend" just like 100k+ before in a game with so less skill involved should stop. imagine everyone would post this here, it's ok to share but WTF makes this to the frontpage. reported anyway.
---
That means we can look at what unique one of a kind card mechanics are in the game now, and guess what future expansions will have. 
---
Same, just thought it might be a fun little detail. 
---
Technically, you’re correct. Thinking about every potential outcome, he should’ve thought of the 2% chance of the one minion evolving that no one plays that would give him lethal. /s
---
emrebnk#2474 EU 80g I'll show you the quest, you go first.
---
Not really, Charged Devilsaur doesnt have a masked rush effect, since it has Battlecry: gain rush, so summoned it still has charge, whereas a summoned rush minion still only has rush.
---
With unstable evolution, the spell literally has echo, its just that it doesnt have the keyword in its text, but I see your point.
---
Dunno if you played wild when boomsday came out, but star aligner was a pretty brutal combo in druid, not just a meme
---
Oh crikey is it the next 3? I thought it was only Shadows. This'll be interesting :)
---
Wow. Absolutely misunderstood the pre-order bundle. Thought it said in the $49.99 one you got the Madam Lazul hero card - I must have misread it and it's a portrait. Well. Damn.
---
Sometimes it feels like people want to go back to playing Yetis and Bolderfist Ogres all day.  
---
You all seem to be enjoying the art process for the cards lately, so here is my process for this little fella as it was one of my favorite pieces.
---
I made a few more ideations for him but not sure if I can post them all here, so here is a handy link with everything: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/V9JVg
---
I know what you meant, but if you only play wild, then wild cards are often much better value than standard cards. For example, Mad Scientist (Naxx, 2014) is one of the strongest niche cards ever printed. They recently printed Masked Contender, a +1 mana situational version of the scientist. It seems unlikely that we'll get any power creep here any time soon. If a card is lasting you 5+ years, then it's pretty good value. 
---
Rafaam’s scheme: Give your opponent a Cursed! card. While they hold it, they take 1 damage at the start of their turn. 
---
The damage would upgrade. So with enough turns, you could put a card to your opponents hand that deals 15 damage at the start of their turn. Very slow, but a good finisher for control i’d think. Not sure about balance tho.
---
Welcome to the club. Enjoy the card back!
---
Was he running Ravencaller? If he was playing a wacky deck like you say he might have gotten Chameleos into your Ravencaller.
---
You might be right, in the boomsday project we had 5 omega cards, and they each costed 1, 2, 3 , 4 and 5 mana respectively.
---
Omega Assembly: 1 mana
---
Omega Mind :        2 mana
---
Omega Medic :      3 mana
---
Omega Defender: 4 mana
---
Omega Agent:       5 mana
---
This doesn't sound right. I would love it if someone could verify or rebuke this
---
Rastakhan's Rumble is outright stated to occur in Stranglethorn in the trailer.
---
Witchwood happens entirely in Gilneas, hence why there are so many Worgen and why characters like Darius Crowley, Tess, and Liam Greymane were printed.
---
This card is so fucking busted
---
I wouldn't care if they put Wild packs into the store for 150 gold to be honest... I just want to buy them. I love Wild but I only started playing in Kobolds so my Wild collection is pretty insignificant and there's so many decks I want to play that I just can't afford.
---
&gt; if they want to stop paying or dust off their collection for Standard, it's worth less too.
---
If the disenchant cost stays the same and the crafting cost is halved, you get these results:
---
* Rarity: Disenchant dust / crafting dust
---
* Common: 5 / 20
---
* Rare: 20 / 50
---
* Epic: 100 / 200
---
* Legendary: 400 / 800
---
I still do not see exactly how on earth this reduces the value of your cards since they grant the exact same value in dust as before, except now you can craft things cheaper. This isn't a reduction in value. Your cards hold no physical value to begin with. 
---
You get literally the same result currently as you would do with this crafting cost reduction if you wanted to dust your stuff to make standard decks. The only change is that if you want to make a wild deck, it's cheaper. But all the people that already have wild decks already have them, so the change barely affects them.
---
If you seriously think that these money whales are going to riot because they can get even more cards / get golden cards cheaper then they are some pretty fucking stupid whales if I may say so myself.
---
Power Word Tentacles never saw any usage in either Standard or Wild. Current usage of Extra Arms is pretty much as fringe as it gets. A number of cards are decent arena cards but essentially never see constructed usage. Which is fine I'm not arguing your point about its usage in arena, but my discussion points are about constructed where the mana costs can make huge differences in the meta playability of a card.
---
To add, even with Radiant Elemental, at best you're paying 2 mana which is the vanilla cost for that type of buff spell. 
---
Yes, Priest can heal minions, but is it always going to be the case that Blizzard is going to give them a one mana penalty for every buff card, whereby no buff card outside of GVG/Classic will see popular usage? At that point, what's the purpose of giving them buff cards? 
---
Care bot is needed here
---
I just reread the tweet from Peter Whalen, and it looks like I was mistaken. Only confirmed no hero card for RoS. Too bad, they only seem to bring issues
---
Thief rogue at rank 1? 
---
Let me warn you. You are in my world now.
---
Behold my coin + coin + concede
---
Thanks
---
You figure out how much it costs to replicate your collection.  Let's say with $1,000.  Then, with a discount, that is more or less going to be your account sell price on 3rd party sites. (if you ever wanted to sell even against the TOS).
---
That pack change raised the average dust return of a pack from about 102 to 140.  I'm not saying this change was bad, it was a net good.  But if you just spent $400 opening packs for Un'Goro, then this change was announced, you might be kinda upset that the money is "wasted".  You'd have been crafting Golden Un'Goro cards instead of trying to complete the set.
---
Not sure, I reckon Hagatha was great for Shaman going into Dragon as it provides some unique lategame that isn't too powerful. Not happy about Boom, but I don't mind Hagatha as it doesn't feel that unfun to play against.
---
Also, there might not be any in future sets either - you never know. 
---
Because if there are more cards then there are more decks you can make. Your logic only applies if you only use one deck. Not exactly rocket science.
---
Well, the guy who wrote that was JAlexander . He literally only plays Rouge at high level, and wrote long posts on Reddit how to balance HS .
---
His post reminds me of my comment when people were ranting about Ultimate Infestation,... i wrote ( half joking) eventually  Blizzard will nerf not UI, but Wildgroth or Nourish.
---
Oh cool, a deck with a win condition with only a 33% automatic failure rate. Yeah seems broken to me 
---
You're right, I don't!
---
For some reason I feel like Rafaam's scheme will either be discover x spells, or draw x cards.
---
As a fellow 14-17 year old (I assume that your age is around that) I say that your mom is right. I really dont think thats its worth it. Last expansion I kept 9500 gold and I was somewhat satisfied with what I got, but if I were to get that from spending 80 euros I wouldve been very dissapointed. Just play the game for fun and you CAN have fun without having all the cards, you dont have to get to rank 5+, the end of month rewards are not that impressive anyway.
---
Maybe after you settle down and have a steady income if you will still be playing the game, then sure, go for it. But for now, I recommend that you just use the money for something more usefull, spend the money on something that you are passioned about other then virtual cards. 
---
But... Boombots deal damage to a random enemy. So this deathrattle would mean Boombots in your opponent's deck deal damage to you. A questionable upside.
---
I'd say it scales pretty well, since it's capped by 10 card hand size, as well as the cards you hold in your hand. For it to be worth considering at 7 mana it'd have to draw like 5 or 6 cards; what if you topdeck it late in game? Are you going to keep a 7 mana get 7 random cards in your opening hand? If you're facing aggro, you're dead if you waste 7 mana on that. Against control, are you going to have enough hand space to justify 7 mana?
---
Ya lolll
---
I dont get how hes rank 149 in legend instead of 4628 or something, unless this is after many additional games of initially hitting legend?
---
Almost fled in terror myself!
---
It was a Vinecleaver (created by Blink Fox), and he buffed it first with Deadly Poison, then with Captain Greenskin. 27 damage total over 4 swings (thankfully some went into minions and not all on my face)
---
still no clue why you can't buy it with gold.
---
Yes, they have, and they have said as much in the past.
---
Beautiful piece of art, never really appreciated it until now. Amazing detail. I also love the small ways it evolved over time, like making the foreground mushroom slightly larger, and adjusting the angles of things like the ferns, or its legs.
---
Your thoroughness is appreciated! Processes aren't always shared, let alone 'alpha' versions, really helps admire the whole process.
---
What I personally get is that the frontal angle and exposing the smaller mandibles helped sell this as a frail 1-drop, whereas heads like C4 look more bulky and reptilian/bird-like.
---
In your two links, nowhere does Blizzard staff say everyone gets a free Legendary card. The quote people are using is talking about the Legendary card you get with the pre-order (after you pay Blizzard money).    
---
Read carefully the two links. Other players who are just random people say this, but Blizzard doesn't say everyone gets a Legendary card for free.  It's confusing because people are taking a quote about what you get if you pre-order out of context.  
---
Here is a better link, and you can see the Blizzard staff never says everyone gets a free Legendary, although he does say everyone gets some free cards.   Those could or could not be legendaries.  
---

---
Alright, thank you. I won't spend money.
---
Yeah, but how often are you going to have those 3 exact legendary cards early enough to play them. If Myra’s is toward the bottom of your deck you just lose. It’s powerful but only if you assemble all the combo pieces.  In the time that takes you get blown out by aggressive decks.  If it takes too long against control decks they just clear your board.  It seems strong and it is, but it’s not going to be so good.
---
Okay, who *wouldn't* choose this over standard? With no triplicates you need to pull, what? 247 cards to complete a set? That's 49.4 packs per wild set. After rotation there will be 7 wild expansion. That's about 345.8 packs to complete your wild collection (barring Adventures).
---
The general thought around here is that a single Standard expansion requires about 250 packs to complete. That is *5 times more* than the cost of a single wild expansion.
---
ya its weird how they did that.  i only really started playing during witchwood so i dont have access to old content, and even though im mot f2p im not willing to buy the old adventures for money for some dust. sucks because when the game gets stale its fun to mess around on the adventures.
---
Where did you find this?
---
Even if he's in dark room, he can just have some of his lackies carry candles instead.
---
I mean, the best maly rogue deck right now nerer actually plays Malygos, but pulls a copy from hand with monstersbehindme. So that metric wouldn't work for that
---
I do agree that Hearthstone is a bad investment of money. You're paying for virtual cards that you can't sell afterwards. You can do your quests and save up on gold for the next expansion.
---
By the holy light!
---
The thing that kind of feels off is the art being ommmreally off center. It just looks wrong in the frame
---
Myra is played now even without the new tool, so the card strength has been endorsed...why do you play it now then, if you can't rely on its consistency?
---
What? I don't understand if you are making sarcasm or what, but I'm too old to brag on Reddit. If you're interested, I also made a post about this but the lists in there are a bit outdated: https://www.reddit.com/r/wildhearthstone/comments/alelpz/first_time_legend_with_reno_mage_some_thoughts/

How To Beat The Shit Out Of Aggro Hunter Decks
---
Ehh if it can kill you on turn 4 it's an aggro deck. 
---
r/cgmcnama posted direct link to the dokument. 
---
Sure you won't.
---
Rlly? I thought it would be the dark knight.
---
And every single one of them is "FUUUUU"
---
The mech version is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I actually liked spell hunter, thought that was a good and healthy archetype for the class. Of course it went against the class archetype of simply crapping out your hand and going face so they had to nerf it into the ground to make way for the archetypes we have now, like mech huntard. 
---
Do you guys think there is ANY chance they would HOF the cards without an announcement?  I'm waiting to craft my golden glitter moth and stagghorn (sorry if spelt wrong) til we get those free packs just to be safe.
---
I did something similar earlier playing Tess Rogue. 
---
Played this card into Benedictus for rage quit.
---
Hunter is cheaper no?
---
Lol, no, they aren’t. They are a shadow of their former selves.
---
RegalSoul#1439 NA trading 80g quest, go first :)

Zolor#21271 EU trading 80g quest, will show but you go first

Obviously the point is even if he didn't notice something it should still say created by under the card 
---
I used to play a lot of Kingsbane rogue and the number of times I got oozed and then proceeded to draw my Kingsbane off the top seemed astronomical. Seems likely there's some sort of system that does stuff like this.
---
How do you do that? I've been playing for years and I never get any better lol Congratulations!
---
Lets not forget that there are still Twinspell cards rogue in future reveal (maybe) that may be used for plan B
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk is leaking 
---
[Okay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)
---
Look at the decks you’re playing right now. How many of them are you still going to be viable when the next expansion hits? Probably none of them, maybe one or two with heavy changes.
---
Now look at the popular Wild decks. How many of them are going to be viable when the rotation happens? Probably all of them. 
---
If you play the game long enough to experience one set rotation then you’ve spent a fuck ton of dust on cards that you can’t play anymore in standard. If you play wild those cards are still viable. That’s why Wild is cheaper. 
---
The second bad feeling will be throwing 1 mana cost pirate + Cannon Barrage
---
**Confirmation bias**
---
Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning. People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way. The effect is stronger for emotionally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs.

No, draws are not rigged. 
---
I... Can't believe I have to say that again. 
---
First of all, the fact nobody play lab recruiter not doesn't mean the card is weak, because the power level now is higher. Second, I think that the 2 cards are different: right now you have to consider what you lose if you play that, and on 2 you can have keleseth for example. Other than that, if you have to choose between lab and the new spell, I think you always pick the second one, because it costs less, you can combo it easier, it's a spell (!! In rogue)...
---
Shadowstep nerfed to 2 mana, Prep nerfed to 2 mana.

Nope.

I’ve crafted 85 golden legendaries in the last year soon, so... y’know 
---
Your first login to Year of the Dragon (Rise of Shadows) which is April 9th.
---
So they can see deck performance and make balance decisions (nerfs as well as future expansions) based on that?
---
context?
---
There are two outcomes. Rag hits face or Smorc. 50/50
---
It would be great if it showed you what the actual best cards were, instead of just substituting what you have available, so you have an idea of what to craft to improve your win rate.
---
How this still available? 
---
Following the past trend it's expected that the hall of fame rotation will happen the day RoS is released
---
That would imply that the best mech deck is still worse than a random assortment of cards from partial even or secret decks. Sure that's possible (or even likely for freeze shaman) but having played that deck with +60% winrate at rank 15 I guess it's unlikely to be the answer here. 
---
Im pretty sure it only uses the high winrate decks and puts cards from those in "problematic" decks like Mech Paladin instead of looking at the real winrates for decks with mech cards in them. Really try it out with a couple of non tier 1 decks in different classes and you get those amalgations from synergyless cards from top decks added in your halfbuild tier 2-3 decks.
---
One thing that's a bit odd is that my priest decks are almost always completed to be a Velen OTK deck, regardless of which initial cards I select.
---
thats also very true. good catch.
---
I can't remember what my first 12 win class was but it was probably either rogue or mage :P
---
Hybrid hunter. For some reason I ran both zombie chow and leper gnome. Had to replace the second bow and Trump said zombie chow is a good card 
---
Cool. What about Wild
---
It was also mentioned that the Lackey pull with grow throughout the year.
---
Older packs of magic are more expensive because of resellers. Older packs of magic is expensive because it was no longer printed. Hs packs are available to everyone's content at any time at any amount. The comparison doesnt match.
---
I predict that your prediction is wrong, because such a card would be extremely unfun.
---
Without twitch hearthstone would never have been a thing. Seems ignorant to try to shame people who spread twitch culture elsewhere. You can dislike it, but not everyone feels the same way as you 
---
I play a lot of Rogue and while what you say is true, there are other sleeper cards that are very strong. I’ve made a couple posts about them, but in addition to Hooktusk, Serrated Tooth is very strong as well. It’s not flashy, but some of the stuff it enables are pretty powerful, and it’s only one mana, great for combos, as well as being 3 durability.
---
I have no doubts that Serrated Tooth’s play rate goes up and that it ends up as a strong support tool in a top tier rogue deck.
---
While this is 100% true, it seems last new year they specifically made the first set less powerful to compensate for this. They are clearly wary of overly powerful cards being around too long.
---
r/commentsyoucanhear
---
While there has to be better plays, it might have been that none of them were great. I've done the Spiteful on curve with no spells left in my deck as a way of saying "Well, you outplayed me because I happened to draw all of my spells in the first 5/6 turns GG"
---
Would there be a way to turn this into an otk?
---
How did this game go? Surprisingly, I could see odd mage as one of the few opponents that could possibly still being able to come back from this
---
Came to say just that... This card helped me win a couple of games!!
---
I never said no one plays lab recruiter. People play it with pogo in anti warrior Myra's lists. And for your last point, I will disagree completely. No current list runs auctioneer, you don't care about playing this until post Myra's so combo is easy to pull off regardless, it's a terrible draw off Myra's, a terrible draw early game, and It has no tempo.
---
Every request that concern Blizz making less money with Hearthstone is doomed. I'm sorry but i'm here for a few years now so don't hope man
---
If you get this message it means he disconnected about 2 minutes before the fact. It just takes a turn or two to show on your end 
---
Complains about no strong draw for rogue in a thread about 1 card that draws entire deck. Bold strategy, let's see how it plays out.
---
Awesome dude! Thanks for sharing your art! I love this card-art, the crystals and shell look excellent!
---
TY!
---
"your minions will betraaaay you!"
---
CHEATIN? CHEATIN? CHEATIN? CHEATIN?
---
0 mana 1-1 with a super cute artwork is my guess 
---
New players start at rank 50.
---
I mean the idea that this deck builder is pulling from Blizz’s internal win-rates feels like it should make it incredibly powerful. As a home brewer I’m excited for it to give me better ideas about cards. 
---
Do you know if we'll still be able to play the KFT adventure post rotation to unlock Arthas?
---
Buy battle net gift cards at your local grocery store! 
---
With Preparation+Any damaging spell+Shadowstep
---
There is a reason why that frog is a Shaman card.
---
Holy cow smite
---
or shadowstep, so hooktusk + coin + togwaggle + shadowstep hooktusk + play hooktusk
---
Can this be stickied?
---
Myracle runs neither of those.
---
Best explanation I’ve ever seen. However, it’s about the simplest, cheesiest deck in the game. I feel conflicted.
---
There’s more then likely a banned card.. couldn’t tell you what card because the games currently not working on iOS 
---
Check if anything was banned? I thought it was a wild brawl
---
Yeah I stared playing around KnC, the Jade mechanic was easy to understand and relatively cheap. Got me all the way to rank 15 before the rotation
---
Try removing yogg and greater healing potion and replacing them.
---
If you're playing other pirates that shouldn't be a problem though. Pull out pirates then shuffle Hooktusk. Real problem with this idea is how overkill it is... You want the big Hooktusk to be the game ender not the combo starter lol 
---
Thank you, good sir.
---
the absolute bare minimum for me to start paying and playing would be the dust refunds increased to HALF of the card cost. Because at the moment it's absurdly low.
---
Hey, that's me :) 
---
If you're interested, [here's my take on Prep](https://old.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/9gpyrj/preparation_the_red_herring_of_rogue_spell_design/)
---
wild cards are in fact worth much less than standard cards. the costs for them should be reduced if blizzard wanted to use ethical economic standards, however many companies prefer to avoid that this day and age.
---
They aren't playing it because other cards are better and playing Myra's can often win the game by itself.
---
Seems to be a hunter thing. Happens every time with Dire Frenzied Huffers and Tundra Rhinos.
---
I hope these keep showing up.
---
Fair enough. I havent played Mill Rogue for a couple of years, but back then one of the main problems with the deck was lack of consistency, since you didnt want to start playing your Coldlights until you had a Gang Up in your hand. Lab Recruiter didnt exist back in those days though, which I guess changes things.
---
MSoG Midrange Hunter without epics or legendaries
---
its simple when it gets the highroll, but if it doesnt, its just a normal control deck with limited value generation so it still needs to play aggresive with 9 and 10 cost minions, so it becomes a harder deck to pilot (having to remember your GY pool, chances of getting each minion, what minions are in deck, which spells are in deck and chances to pull them with shadow essence...). Without the highroll on 3-4, as OP says, 7 out of 8 games you have to "think" more than many other decks.
---
I guess that since its a deck with a very highroll strategy, it has become hated and as every single hated deck, everyone thinks its easy to pilot. I still remember when people where saying control warrior in release was a braindead deck because you only played removal, hero power and passed turn...
---
Great post! Thanks for sharing that spreadsheet, it looks really useful!
---
How do you get 352 dmg. Malygos + other spell dmg minion? Because 2 malys +  5 Velens results in 384 dmg. Sorry but i just know how do you get that specific number. Maybe 1 maly + 4spell dmg minion  + velens?
---
It’s more just the whole res mechanic needs to be reworked. Ex: cubed doom-guards (the two summoned off of the cube) shouldn’t be resummoned from Guldan and priest shouldn’t be able to resummon token like minions (Barnes 1/1 summon and shadow essence summon). If they reworked the res mechanic cubelock would lose a lot in power level via nzoth and guldan and big priest would be a lot slower 
---
I have a request. Can you make the deck builder also change the deck's name from Custom [Class] to anything else? Maybe some cards from the list, maybe random fun words etc. 
---
Nice analysis KBT!
---
If you delete your collection you'll probably log I  first
---
Does anyone know if the free legendary will likely be disenchantable? If it's like Marin then pre order seems less worth it for me.
---
Im trying to complete the Rumble shrines and this card is in the double battlecry deck. I've had many, many tries so far and this card is consistently in my opening hand. It's also one of the first cards I had a golden copy of.
---
&gt;Keep an Unfinished Arena Run at two Losses  
---
[What do I do now?](https://imgur.com/a/y6BwnVE)  
---
On the other hand, the Wild playerbase is tremendously less competitive. You have a better shot with a Standard deck in Wild than in Legend.

Murloc Shaman
---
Exactly my point 
---
&gt;because physical card games you can get money back at the end
---
Okay, but compared to hearthstone, you get CENTS. You get almost no return on investment. 
---
When the cards rotate out, they're basically just expensive paper. You could try and sell your whole collection to someone, but usually they say no, because THEY don't want the job of sorting through it, just to MAYBE find one card worth a dollar. 
---
Where's "Mrrggrrrllggrrrr?"

Hey zougas12, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters.

---
Wretched Tiller yeet!
---
Exactly, same thoughts about that card. All three huffers/rhinos drawn before turn 8 without a single master's call.
---
Nice!
---
Nomi is gonna be a meme card for sure. Its a dead card for most of the turns you draw, so no it wont see any play except first 3 days. 
---
The first minutes/hours/days after rotation are the perfect moment to gain some insight into the deckbuilders function. 
---
Looking forward to it.
---
(But yeah i don't think anyone thinks it has anything to do with machine learning.) 
---
Maybe I should start collecting data :D.
---
Pretty sure it's roughly about 33.3% of the time it happens. And thats too many times in my opinion.
---
Those are the 4 most common Priest archetypes, with Wall being the highest win rate. The cards you put in are already in those decks.
---
The deck builder do try to complete the deck with your card if the card is already in their deck recipes. If the card is not then it does what I said.
---
There have been other people that posted about this, it might be a new feature that will be implemented in the next patch. 
---
I like this guide it makes me feel smarter playing big priest.
---
Blizzard please ban everyone who is better than me. K thanks bye
---
I'd take at least 2 attempts to get 12 wins and see if I could repeat.  Unless you don't want to play anymore.
---
KKona Clap hell yeah brother
---
If they dont have a ping and you can follow him up with a nice curve that good ole boy can represent at least 9 damage to face. Love that card 
---
Very true. Explains why there is not a single Murloc deck in tier 3 or above given the overabundance of AoE. 
---
The deck builder does some weird stuff when autofilling paladin decks. 
---
For example, I made the shell of a control paladin core with [20 cards](https://imgur.com/a/rWK7LsZ) to see what the auto completer would fill in. It finished the deck with [low budget zoo cards](https://imgur.com/a/psNlxVL). Very strange.
---
I'm not saying it's doing the job perfectly, just that's what it's trying to do. They just released some bug fixes today; I'm sure there are many more. It's probably miscalculating the importance of Azalina in Toggwaggle.
---
I like your cards, I think I will TAKE x cards from your opponent’s deck!
---
Actually nah that’s way too OP...
---
Also warpath and phantom militia where high tier cards at seversl points  
---
And face collecter is a great meme for greedy value players. 
---
I like echo, and the echo cards from last year will see more play this year as the powerlevel drops drastically. 
---
That paladin looks very strong good luck.
---
I’m playing on iPad Air wit the latest iOS as well and it’s an absolute nightmare right now. I can barely play a game on it but as soon the game is over is just crashes. I can’t even edit decks without it crashing. I think they’re having maintenance on Monday and I hope if they’re unable to fix it before then it will be fixed afterwards. 
---
Alternatively, don't open any more packs that might contain rotating cards (so Classic and Witchwood in this case) between crafting the HoF cards and the actual rotation. That way you get to play for a while in Standard with the cards you crafted.
---
There is no word on what the legendary is or if it can be disenchanted.  My guess is that it will be like Marin and C'thun (not disenchantable) But it's only a guess.  
---
The Golden Legendary Zayle, which you get from the 5th Wing of PvE cannot be disenchanted.  And while not offered in packs, the regular copy of Zayle can be crafted.
---
Yeah I know what you mean. Some of the nerfs just totally changed decks. I wanted to play oil rogue again now that I have the full deck.
---
One thing that drives me to play this game is it’s artwork 
---
Odd Paladin. I started playing in WW, pulled Baku as one of my first legendary and it was the cheapest Tier 1 deck, with the added advantage of a straight forward play style. I guess it says I'm a pragmatic player who just makes the most of what I got. Probably describes most of us though, so not very insightful.
---
These old things? About to throw em away
---
I Luke how this card being a 1-drop led everyone to think it was a tiny bug. However, that is one big boy.
---
Don't be, it's a wall priest
---
EVIL Miscreant is really good, imagine this at 2 mana with less stats, it would be insane, the only drawback with the card is the combo at 3 mana, the lackys will be less effective by then unless you coin it out
---
Yeah, It´s amazing! :-)
---
Priest has really good OTK in this Brawl too, I'm at like 50 wins with my Velen clone deck.
---
I'd craft moth, put it in an odd priest deck and call it moth priest. In honor of skyrim.
---
The warlock is casting Fear, doesnt he?
---
These are great! Do you plan on doing every set?
---
I think it's that most of us played one run with each class, so the less common treasures and bosses are mostly unexperienced, unlike Dungeon Run, where you may have seen some of the rare things like Tad's Pole.
---
Try mechathun warlock. I’ve had plenty of success with that
---
Infinite-value Gauntlet*
---
Every time i put a card and autocomplete a rogue deck, it basically makes the same deck/pirate package.. is it based on currently popular decks?
---
Oh! It could be that this expansion is the start of the league and the next is when they're at full power and in every class. Than at the end they make a huge mistake, like apocalypse bringing mistake (One of the original 5 could also betray everyone else too).  
---
Then the last expansion is everyone working together to stop the world from ending, maybe all the heros were defeated so it is up to the League to fix their mistakes and defeat Deathwing and/or the Old Gods?
---
I could do without that in my life
---
Historically the community is terrible at predicting card power.
---
Pls ban that bitch zoe oops wrong game
---
This is a bug that has been in the game (forever, I think). If you run your mouse over the card at the exact moment that the game registers the card being played, for some reason it never lets you interact with it. It doesn’t know the card is there.
---
That's why you play the Murloc quest, duh.
---
I might be wrong, but this is probably wrong subreddit.
---
The black and white drawing looks like it came from Made in Abyss manga.
---
Dread. Every time I see that my opponent is a murloc hero. 
---
I do recall hearing that at some point.
---
All caps when you spell the man name
---
The Drygulch Jailer (with the three SIlver Hands in the background) is such a good and flavorful piece of art, it's a shame that it's unnoticeable in-game.   
---
Thanks for doing these!
---
Why aren't Reno and Solia glowing yellow?
---
Thanks! Great way to pass the time on my commute. Channel added.
---
Hearthstone in general is overpriced. The value you recieve for what you pay is not nearly enough. £45 here in the UK for 50 packs a legendary and a card back. That will sadly not get you any where close to the full set. So that is £45 spent and not even a full experience for the game. For that same price you can buy a full AAA game here on PC and change (depending on the game). If I spent £40 on a new game on GOG that is mine forever. My cards in Hearthstone are leased and I will lose all access forever should they ever turn the servers off.
---
Wild I would suggest should have a lower entry fee across the board. Packs/adventures and dust costs should be cheaper. Wild will struggle immensely to ever get new players that haven't played for years on end already without having a way for new players to hit the ground running. I guess the question is do old players care more about not devaluing their collection or having a shorter queue time and more interest in general in their favourite mode. More people having fun together is surely worth it? :)
---
*I've been alive for my entire life* **and I never once made that connection.**
---
***Crazy.***
---
You can't play it in casual
---
That's kind of tricky because they are activated abilities, which don't translate well to hearthstone's formatting
---
Read the list in the bundle. Now ask yourself why you would get something that is not explicitly listed in the said bundle.
---
No you have to waste more money
---
Thanks for the comprehensive reply and willingness to answer future questions. I can tell from your post that you're really knowledgeable on the topic, so I might have to take you up on your offer sometime. I'll probably start with YouTube and move on to the books once I get my feet wet. Cheers!
---
That is true, it's a fast effect. 
---
You could not be more right. Thanks for spelling it out. 
---
Anyfin can happen anyone? It breaks the rules
---
The Darkness might've shuffled multiple Kodos from Kodorider into barokas' deck with Psychic Scream. That or casting Deck of Wonders. 
---
I’ve beat the Dungeons with all classes long ago. Warrior took me 39 bosses but eventually got through with an Aggro Enrage deck — [decklist here](https://imgur.com/gallery/P4rbbW1)
---
Well, everyone on Reddit is the same person anyway.
---
Except you, of course.
---
And soon, they will lose their best two cards.
---
Though I feel like "deal 2 damage to a minion and 3 to you" with echo would be an OK warlock card. Or maybe a 0 attack creature that says "instead of attacking, you may deal 2 damage to a creature and 3 to you". 
---
I’m having strong Moira and Balrog PTSD looking at The Darkness artwork
---
Wooosh!
---
What’s 11+4?
---
Return to Ravnica
---
I don’t. I really **REALLY** don’t.
---
That’s a good question. If I recall correctly it might’ve been something to do with some bombs from Dr. Boom’s Boombox being shuffled into my deck.
---
I’m saying this now, unless a really, really cool or funny deck show up next expansion I’m going to make a thief rouge deck 
---
Paladin and hunter makes me a bit sad, they both have so much cool stuff, but it’s so hard to utilize it.
---
