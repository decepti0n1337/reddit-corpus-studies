Im cut from a cloth if players who believe that a win with an off-meta deck counts for a lot more than a tier 1 deck win. I used to play tournament MTG. I always had way more fun playing with casuals at home because novice players made crazy decks and you never knew what you'd run into. I love the community on twitch and reddit and sharing things about the game, but I wish that more players wanted to innovate more than win. WE could decide the meta if we were not constantly looking to streamers and stats for guidance. But in the end. I'm using every resource available. And for now, I'm using heal pally at the floor of rank 5 to keep out face hunters and let in more of the other guys. Like a club bouncer.

Currently, the cards that should have been removed with the release of DOD were not actually removed. There's a glitch that allows for you to continue using them.
---
Yeah but that just means they get two less class cards.
---
Why should he erase it? This bug needs attention and needs to be -fixed-, seeing as it is incredibly unfair towards some people. 
---

---
And no, "hurr durr, but it's fun" does not apply if it is onesided and gamebreaking like this.
---
Depends on your brand, I know that Samsung has a preinstalled application named Game Launcher which you can use to record games.
---
Hsreplay.net also has an application named Arcane Tracker which uploads your replays to their online environment. This is slightly less flashy but allows you to go through your games turn by turn.
---
The hardest part.

^(Have a question or think a mistake was made?) **[^(Message the moderators because I am a bot.)](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fhearthstone)**
---
I had the same question. Is there anything that won’t take up so much memory? Also, is there any one in particular for recording on a MacBook that is good?
---
Is that weapon + invoke + HP + heroic strike?  Insane!
---
It's unreliable because people use it to support stances like 'Priest is actually amazing, fuck anyone who ever said Blizzard's handling of Priest is bad' and 'Deathrattle Rogue is OP it needs a nerf right fucking now look at it it's tier 1!!111!!!!!'. It fluctuates too often to give what people use it as - an overview of the meta. It's a good indicator of what people are playing, and what people perceive are good. 
---
Something like VS is much better for a proper overview of a settled meta. Quest Priest is not going to remain 'tier 1' forever (I'd contest it's even tier 1 right now, it's just that people don't know how to play against it and face hunter is still popular because of low dust cost). 
---
I'm definitely not saying HSreplay is a bad tool. It's a useful tool for almost everything *except* describing which decks are truly good or bad in a fully comprehensive sense. Quest Priest is good right now, but once people stop playing Face Hunter/the meta shifts to counters, it'll fall off quickly. Unlike stuff like Galakrond or Evo Shaman, Quest Priest has numerous counters, none of which are difficult to figure out. Hell, if Quest Priest was really able to be a tier 1 deck it would've done so during parts of the Uldum meta. Evo was definitely not the only deck that stopped Quest Priest, and that's when Quest Priest had N'Zoth, one of its most powerful tools.
---
Haha the door man killed me!
---
Oof
---
Oh god please erase this post and don’t let people see it
---
I hate the old adventures.due to deck bulding. The new system is better.
---
Baffled they printed a neutral card that just nukes ALL ARMOR lmfao
---
What exactly am I supposed to be seeing here? Is this some new  meme template that I'm  too boomer to understand?
---
Brave of you to run psychopomp in that deck lol
---
Reno priest is pretty expensive.
---
Reno, Raza, anduin, kazakus as a start.
---
Nowadays you can add zeph and Benedictus and quest and go really nuts
---
Pretty impressive that 5/9 classes have a tier 1 deck (last 7 days on hsreplay)
---
If you include hard mulligan for apothecary and backstab, the chance to have exactly one or more of either by turn 4 is 56% chance to draw, going first. The combination of having both backstab and apothecary isn't reliable and kind of hard to compute(my guesstimate is between 20-25%), but comboing with a 1 mana play on turn 5, well, getting backstab or one of the 8 one drops by turn 5 is 97%, so basically always. Getting at least one apothecary by turn 5 has a chance of 60%. The fail chance to draw both anubisath at this point is about 6%. 
---
Going second you only need the apothecary, and your chance to have one or both at turn 3 is 60%, again with the roughly 5% chance to get both Anubisath in your hand.
---
**TL;DR:**  
---
If rogue goes first, you can expect the combo 60% of the time to happen on turn 5 or turn 4. It's much more likely to be turn 5 because of lack of a combo activator and fewer draws. 
---
If rogue goes second, just expect the apothecary to happen on his turn 3. It will happen 60% of the time, and the chance goes up ~4% for every additional draw from novice engineer.
---
Wow that was actually the worst comeback in the world
---
All you need is Barnes and blood of the ancient one
---
 SoloLion#1300 NA I'll show you go first.
---
My cover is blown!
---
Yeah, Alex reminds me of pre-nerf Yogg sometimes: wins you games you had absolutely no chance to win otherwise.
---
My two worse losses against her were in the exact same spot: I was Galakrond Warrior, had board control, lethal for next turn, a bunch of cards in hand while my opponent had nothing but his topdeck that turned out to be Alex. 
---
In one of the games Alex got my opponent a full heal with Nozari, another Alex into Kalecgos into removal into the Druid 4/8 Taunt Dragon. Lost the game on the spot.
---
Against my other opponent he got the gain 5 armor Dragon, another Alex, the new Ysera, another Alex, another gain 5 armor Dragon into the old Alex to set up lethal for next turn.
---
Granted, not all Alexztrazas are as crazy as this, but the lowrolls are never as bad as the old Yogg lowrolls that would lose you the game. I think we will be talking a lot about this card in major tournaments.
---
If that were true why wasnt it mentioned in the post about why they nerfed him?
---
Every once in a while in wild I'll bust out a warrior weapon deck including furnace fire collosus and people respect concede when I play a huge one in casual a lot lol
---
Actually he could of had his parents have him very late in their life comparatively to most of the world. Such as my father is a "baby boomer" but I'm a senior in HS
---
Has that actually been successfully pulled off? Like consistently every match? I’ve always liked the card but it’s sadly a bad card.
---
You weren't kidding lmao. 5 years ago he has rage posts on this sub similar to this. This dudes mother must be a salt shaker.
---
You said it lol it isn’t consistent but it is fun, I tried it when I had Barnes and it was for sure fun but I mean a single minion removal is not hard :c
---
Why is this survey not going out to all HS players?
---
In the free version of HsReplay, the Stats you get might be useful below rank 10, but it's not really what you are looking for if you are interested in actual good data (except you pay).
---
------------
---
I want to share with you some sites you might not know yet, each one has their pro and cons.
---
* [ViciousSyndicate](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/): They provide a meta snapshot. This one is based on the stats of people contributing to it. Not only do you get stats you can filter by all, Rank 4 to Legend or only Legend but you also get a writeup, explaining why the meta is changing how it is
---
* [Tempostorm](https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot/): They provide a meta snapshot. This one is based on experts for every rank. They share whey they placed a deck in their tier
---
* [Hearthstone-decks.net](https://hearthstone-decks.net/descent-of-dragons-top-legend-decks-week-2-standard-and-wild/): This is my personal website. We feature Decks played high Legend by players around the world. This is not like the other a meta snapshot. You will find normal "meta decks", but also Decks you will very rarely see on ladder. We believe that this format is a good way to share what is actually played **right now**, not one week ago. Something between 20-50% of the decks we post by pros will never be featured on HsReplay since not enough players are playing the exact decklist.
---
--------------
---
* To take personal stats HsReplay is amazing, their Decktracker is nice too.
---
* Stats for Decks you get are not correct
---
   * Easy decks have too high winrate
---
   * Hard Decks have too low winrate
---
* Netdecking is giving you suboptimal versions that are maybe outdated or just a cheap version of a better build
---
Since I have a website myself "competing" with HsReplay (not really, I am way smaller and have a different market) you can't trust me 100%, but I think there are other websites that are just better to get stats or good builds.
---
Yeah and you need 2 blood of the ancients on NOED at the same time and Barnes only summons one. 
---
Unless of course I’m missing something.
---
"Patches' strength has caused almost every class to add some Pirates just to benefit from him."
---
This includes the Control Warlock of the time, which ran two Southsea Captains and Patches.
---
Sometimes the best answer to something broken is to play it as well.
---
Colored ink...? You could afford highlander mage
---
Oh my god the dedication... I wonder how long that list was
---
They are not a fun and interactive play style.
---
at least she knows it's a card game
---
I just played against quest resurrect priest twice with this deck and won both times. Seems they can’t stop the refill of board
---
Ikr its such a good counter to that deck!
---
I think as long as you don’t get too cocky and hold cards such as the free 3/5 taunt and mulch instead of dumping it they waste all their board clear then you go in
---
Seryth#11326 NA - 80g trade
---
I've been playing a friend's Homebrew handlock that features quest, zephrys (several dupes) and Nomi if you want to really greed it up. We've both been having surprising success too
---
sometimes you dont even receive any mmr for a game eg. i just came 2nd and my mmr didnt change
---
*spits*
---
I think highlander mags is a very good and powerful deck but is suffering from the popularity of face hunter which it’s very weak too, as well as the fact that it’s just a tough deck to pilot correctly.
---
I agree. I do ok with it, ranked to 8 from 12. Facehunter is just to fast. Trying other more healing deck might help tho.
---
This is an interesting debate, though for practical purposes it’s like asking in which testicle would you like to have a tumor.  😒
---
I mained pirate warrior at that time so the statue has to trade every turn in order to prevent lethal, extra health also prevents the minion from dying quickly so it can't be resurrected
---
They always come down with barnes
---
They stated that they don't like the idea of mill cause it feels terrible for the player on the receiving end or something like that. A shame as mill decks, especially deadmans warri were among my alltime favorites. Alas the world keeps spinning and new ways to mill will certainly find its way into standard. Right now its just vargoth and research project but who knows maybe we will see more? They kinda forget what they hate every once in a while and we will be waiting :)
---
That’s just like kicking a puppy it’s no threat but you still go all out
---
Halestorm#11623 looking to trade 80g quest on NA. I show, you go first.
---
It's good, but not tier 1 anymore. 
---
Hunter, warrior, rogue and priest can handily beat it.
---
I just realized today that convincing infiltrator is a reference to the "hello fellow kids" meme
---
I kinda wanna learn more...
---
Found the priest
---
Yes. They came through about 20 minutes after I posted this. Will take the thread down.
---
&gt; It was one of the most unique playstyles 
---
Mill has existed in just about every card game. It really isn't unique. The term mill comes from another game entirely. 
---
# Plus, if mill is ever good, the vast majority of players will hate it
---
&gt;And Blizzard has said something about Class identity as an excuse to move certain cards for Hall of Fame, but c'mon they targeted Vanish, Coldlight Oracle and Naturalize, which were the premier Mill cards from the Classic set. 
---
Vanish is a logical induction when the class it exists in is supposed to not be great at dealing with wide boards.
---
Coldlight Oracle is a *neutral card*, so class identity doesn't really come into play there.
---
And Naturalize is a card that falls more in line with Ice Block: a card that has generally overstayed its welcome in Standard.
---
&gt;But Blizzard didn't target Fan of Knives (really good card imo, even for todays standards), 
---
No it really isn't. Three mana for a Whirlwind is awful. The card is only ever playable because of the cycle effect it has and with the nerf to Preparation, it's questionable whether the card will ever see play outside of a Miracle deck.
---
It is a slight bend to Class identity *at worst.*
---
&gt;Naturalize was moved because it somehow broke class identity, 
---
From the announcement:
---
&gt;Druids have always had excellent flexibility and a number of different tools when it comes to generating mana, cards, and minions, but have long struggled to remove their opponent’s large minions. Naturalize effectively nullifies that weakness, giving Druids a powerful option in matchups where card advantage doesn’t matter. Moving it into the Hall of Fame enforces the Druid’s weakness in removing large minions, maintaining its class identity. 
---
You evidently *do not remember* the Year of Druid from KotFT to the beginning of RR format.
---
With the tools Druid had at that moment, namely Spreading Plague and Ultimate Infestation, Naturalize's draw back *did not matter*.
---
&gt;Also, Big Game Hunter still actively breaks the "class identity" rule 
---
Big Game Hunter is also a Neutral card
---
# Class identities does not matter for neutral cards.
---
&gt;Additionally, kinda hilarious how Hunter is supposed to have weak board clear but they still got Veranus this very expansion, which grants you a complete board clear with UTH and even gets you a 7/6 while at it. 
---
Here's some stuff you're forgetting:
---
1. Veranus does not clear the board by itself
---
2. She is also legendary
---
3. A combo with Unleash the Hounds cost **nine mana**
---
Team 5 is not using class identity as an "excuse" to eliminate mill decks from Standard.
---
I can only think of 4 examples of them returning wild cards to standard, Toki, Giggling Inventor and Jan'ali were all new cards that generated wild cards. Then last October there was an event that brought back 23 (I think) wild cards, during the event everyone received temporary free copies of the relevant cards
---
It's called Secret Mage.
---
made my day thank you haha
---
Whizbang should be a classic set card
---
Invest
---
I've been using token druid and it's really cheap and fun to play for me. I think face Hunter is also pretty cheap but not certain and that's supposed to be really good rn.
---
But it does sound like a lot of fun
---
100 000
---
dont really like face deck, prefer control or tempo deck. I got rekt by a priest who keep healing everytime and x102020283 taunts, that deck makes me cry
---
Offtopic : Did stephen crowder ever change his mind?
---
(I’m not sexist because I don’t beat my wife) k
---
Rng is in every online card game. And many decks on ladder have very little rng. The only reason arena has an abnormal amount nowadays is because of the power creep from recent expansions. It’s just apart of the online card game life
---
Except most the meta decks haven’t even been running dragons lol
---
It was pre-nerf because of Galakrond powercreep foreseeing.
---
Not when a Sneed’s comes out
---
Or machine gun fire that's extra difficult on mobile.
---
Not really, even back in the WotOG he never saw play
---
Once you get to a certain skill point the most useful part of helper apps is the deck tracker. You may just be unlucky with card and hero options and/or don't have the skill you think you have.
---
I like plague merchant in galakrond warlock zoo because it can get you another giant early or give you just that little bit of hand refill until you get your draw cards!
---
Needs more salt.
---
There goes Mr Humbug,
---
There goes Mr Grim.
---
If they gave a prize for being been,
---
The winner would be HIM.
---
Muppet Christmas Carol is really good xD
---
When you want to play such a thing online, you will need other players, and to invest for developing that you would need a form of financial returns
---
Maybe you could sell avatars?
---
When I saw rogue's Galakrond, it instantly screamed out combo deck to me. Shit like Malygos or the 6 mana combo: deal 1 for each card played guy. I can't see it having a place in standard without Vanish or Evasion.
---
Ohh my God! I knew I've been listening to ghosts ever since I started playing Hearthstone.
---
YOU FACE NYARAXXUS
---
Highlander rogue if played right is the best deck right now , it takes some time to learn it but its worth it
---
I am a returner, mainly returned for battlegrounds but stayed for lols. I am not competitive player, I like to get epic card every end of the month and want to play at some skill degree whatsoever. When I left the game, I was no more having fun from play mode and arena was crap -left after boomsday. 
---
Though I never complained about RNG. If I wanted a game without RNG, I could always play chess and I am good at it! I was actually I don't remember the last time I played it, you know no fun.. 
---
I like that nobody is going to have a very high winrate in this game, and if some of the players want to earn some money of it or they want to earn their life from this game, they can play a lot like 8 hours a day and have a very good chance at being successful, just like having a full-time job. 
---
So get your priorities, if you want to earn money or your life from this game, think it as a full time job. If you want to have fun this game is probably for you, but has random and surprising elements going on you can't know which side you will end up. So if you don't like that aspect of the games you're playing, simply go play games with no -or fewer- random elements in it, like chess.
---
...cuz thats the definition of astronomical odds?
---
Its extremely unlikely and rare in occurrence, but given a large enough sample size, anything can be sampled.
---
Easy solution:
---
For Blizzard's hiring process, they should just call 9 applicants at random, and the first one to pick up gets the job on the spot. Other applicants face a minor employment MMR drop.
---
Wow
---
Not a chill wind Yeti? My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruin
---
&gt; The thing I don’t get is those revive decks aren’t really fun for anyone. I could see if they were just annoying to play against, but I found that playing the decks wasn’t much more enjoyable.
---
 Reviving dead minions is a card game staple that a lot of players enjoy
---
There are ways around it. You could roll a d20 to determine which group of 20 it's in
---
Roll a 1 and the group is 1-10
---
Roll a 2 and it's 11-20
---
Etc
---
 Then roll a d10 for the group.
---
How would that work?
---
As a Control player, i rater face an aggro deck instead of galakrond shaman, it was a 0 skill deck that could win against everything, you could just put a witching brew and a zilliax and go well even against face hunter, this meta is healthier than the one with a turn 7 2 8/8 with rush, 5 armor and a 5/2 weapon.
---
If you print them all then just shuffle and draw one?
---
Might as well make it 2 mana cheaper.
---
The deck was tier 3 at best in uldum and since then the only card it added is volcanic potion so play some uldum still decks like quest shaman or quest druid and you'll have a better matchup
---
I had a priest game vs a warlock where I got a Cantrina out and it just kept resummoning the same Witchwood grizzly every single turn to cockblock this warlock's deck.
---
Reddit is always wrong with meta prediction, it's fucking embarrassing to see
---
Albatross should be used as a small package, not as an archetype. If the right Control Priest shell gets found, it will be good.
---
Most brain dead deck ever.
---
Your mom sounds awesome!
---
Let Hunter die.
---
First throw, hundreds. Second, tens. And third, units.
---
To find the number in a list.
---
Least powerful and it’s not even close is Priest
---
If it's freezing he can still attack with the SI? Are you even watching?
---
Again, maybe im to used to wild, because ever since reno decks resurged, they will absolutely fight you until they are fatiguing, espcially when death knights happened, most people of course concede way before than or combo then before it was relevant they could do that, and seeing as raza priest as top dog then thats pretty apparent it was happening to people
---
You don't need to make a new deck every month? Just because a deck falls out of tier 1 doesn't mean its time to dust and get something new, even a 5% decrease in winrate which looks significant will only slow you down by 1/20 games. Can't much comment as to your difficulty getting to rank 5 as I'm already there so I don't get set so far back as other players who are lower and also trying to reach it.
---
Do you need double Banker? Otherwise I'd just go Highlander.
---
When the deck starts at like 53% winrate and it decreases by 5%, that's a pretty big deal don't you think?
---
The Hunter would kill the SI:7 obviously. Have you ever played against a Secret deck?
---
Knights of the Frozen Throne was the first introduction to 'proper' infinite resources, with single-card win conditions like Frost Lich Jaina and Bloodreaver Gul'dan. Death Knights changed Standard for as long as they were in it, and it was a real 'return to regular form' when they rotated out and resources became far more finite.
---
Raza Priest with Anduin was a Combo deck, not a Control deck.
---
Well, that was a ride
---
Dont know why. Since i put 2 earthshocks in my deck, DR rogue and face hunter are way better to handle
---
Yes Thats what I said, I said or people would combo them, and seeing raza priest was so big in wild that was happening everywhere, I think elysiana still would have been wanted to run in that wild meta after raza died
---
Honestly, I have to disagree with not pressing the disenchant all button.
---
Nerfs happen so rarely and when they do, if it happens to a common card, you only get 40 dust back for it. So you are going to be sitting on all these cards and potential dust that you may use towards cards you may actually play while waiting for nerfs that may never come?
---
I always mass disenchant. I'm trying to enjoy the game now. Not wait and save 7 copies of a card for a potential nerf in May 2021. 
---
I'll admit I'm not a FTP player, and I've seen this theory more than once. I can ask some of my more competitive FTP friends if you want me to. Chances are they will say something similar because they need the dust to play now.
---
Basically Dragon Priest was peak priest. Every time I play wild I pray my priest opponent is a dragon priest because it's a fun engaging matchup that can go either way, unlike every other priest that's always total feast or famine.
---
Dragon priest had a solid 12345 curve and it was based on winning on the board and healing its minions. While having some boardclears that synergized with the rest of the deck, rather than the boardclears being overpowered symmetrical play alone cards that you use just to delay the game and frustrate the opponent (plague, scream, whatever the heck the 5 mana attack everything was called). 
---
Any ladder deck needs some overpowered cards and 1 mana 2/3, 2 mana 2/4 taunt, 5 mana 5/6 steal a card were blatantly overpowered, but you don't mind because you can boardclear the dragon priest back and win. They didn't have a free hand fill or 1-card board refill, they were an honest deck.
---
Most importantly dragon priest matches weren't about beating down the same minion 20 times. They also weren't about face rushing the priest before you die to some stupid kill combo. Even \*if\* they ran DS/IF it still required an enabler on the board, which wasn't dead easy to set up. (IIRC most of the time dragon priest didn't even run DS/IF because obviously midrange hates having dead cards in the hand)
---
Classes are defined mostly by their core set and hero power. Priest's core set is a lot about buffing your board and/or keeping it alive and hero power is about healing your board (not so much your hero). I don't understand why priest is constantly being taken away from being a midrange board fighting class when that's what they should excel at. All they need is a great 1-drop and great 2-drop and the class is instantly good. They haven't had a good 1-drop into 2-drop in years and they've either been either trash tier or carried so much by a blatantly overtuned lategame play that everyone hates playing against it.
---
Ah yes "obviously" so why didn't he then? This is *obviously* some weird highlander because no normal deck runs Applebaum, secrets and Mech package, and if highlander is anything it's inconsistent with draws. Please stop talking it's genuinely embarrassing
---
That seems like it would be significantly less consistent
---
Ctrl + Shift + S
---
Raza on 5
---
Anduin on 8
---
Guess I'll lose
---
Congrats! Do you have a deck code?
---
Idk why Myra rotspring is there but it's my new avatar
---
Dude.   
---
A) It is statistically impossible for 50% of players (the average player) to reach the top 0.5% of players (Legend).  
---
B) So you are really good at Hunter. Good for you. This guide is not written for you, it is written for beginner players. Just ignore and move on instead of shitting on this guide just because you already know these things.   
---
C) Even if 90% of face hunter plays were obvious to everyone (go face), discussing and theorizing about the 10% of plays is interesting enough for so many people.   
---
D) Face hunter feels very unintuitive for many experienced players. I have player nearly every kind of hunter: Yogg&amp;Load, Dinomancy, Reno, Quest, Quest with Mech, Mech, Cube, Oondasta, Highlander (with Brann), Spell, Secret, Vereesa... practically everything besides Face hunter. I'm absolutely terrible at it because every time I go face instead of trading it feels like I'm making a huge newbie mistake. This guide was very useful for me to "unlearn trading" and going face, as simple as going face might feel.
---
Thank you for actually addressing my issue rather than attacking my own skill. It's appreciated.
---
The metas where Priest is tier 4 are my favorites because I don't have to play against them.
---
Yes. This was an issue in the early competitive HS as the many top players ignored swaths of players to avoid matching for easy wins. Their queue times were insanely long. 
---
I use it to avoid people who rope every turn or other annoying behavior. It should be easier to ignore players.
---
the last 2 years of expansions I've only heard about how annoying they used to be and how weak they are now.
---
It's a better deal than usual but still not a price im comfortable paying
---
Still
---
Would be cool to get the 1000 wins portrait of each hero :D
---
The other card games that have the mechanic also have meaningful ways of countering it. Hearthstone just has 2 cards for 2 classes. And even then it's still a coinflip in if it will work or not.
---
There's ragnaros and sylvanis who are kind of in battleground. Rarely picked though.
---
Buff the spirit of the shark with goblin lackey
---
Agreed. Been playing almost every week since whispers, and this is the most fun I've ever had with the game. If we ignore the controversial doom in the tomb event (fun but lasted a few weeks too long), I think the year of the dragon has been a massive success. Easily better than any of the other named years.
---
Merry Christmas! I'm trading an 80g quest on the EU server, my battletag is Kamugg#2401
---
I'll show you my quest but you go first
---
ill take it over waiting 45 minutes to find out my arcivist  is worse than my opponents
---
Buff the shark spirit and attack with it. It would have 2 attack so it wouldn't kill the minion and proc the deathrattle
---
Because priest doesn’t have a fun mechanic? Do you think quest ressurect is fun?
---
Only one of them is a class card, and a classic one. The other two are neutrals
---
Cool — thought it seemed like an outlier.  Thanks!
---
exactly, its awesome when you hit the curve, and really really bad when you dont, so many things can go wrong with your draws.
---
LOL we should!
---
The contrast in Battletags is amusing.
---
How does a class win through healing?
---
Long time hearthstone player, but I quit a couple expansions ago. Is battlegrounds free to play or is it behind some type of paywall?
---
It has far more counterplay than quest rogue ever did. The game is not over until they proc 3+ deathrattles AND you don't have lethal on board. A single disruption in the form silence, weapon destruction, etc is usually enough to swing the game in your favor. Even the nuts draw is not an auto-win for the rogue. And with vanish gone, you can always just go face with relative impunity and force them to trade.
---
i just concede when i see a northshire, saves me alot of tilting
---
I'm not. That is why I'm stuck between 8-9. And I play 5 to 6 games a day. Sometimes 10 max.
---
I mean, eventually you'll get matched with s counter deck because that person is playing that deck and is on the same matchmaking bag, if you want 100 favourable games it's almost impossible
---
Hi not, I'm dad!
---
Hahaha yes, what a coincidence!
---
I would be cautious about buying. The price to dust value is reasonable, but all of these expacs were historically weak. Adding rotation, you're really looking at buying dust, which is inevitably less efficient than buying packs that might have good cards and give dust. If you haven't bought any packs for the expacs, then it might be worth considering but a disenchanted legendary is still only 400 dust. If you get a guaranteed legendary for each expansion, then you're getting at best 3200 extra dust, which isn't that much better than just getting 2 legendaries that you want to play (it is better because you can enchant staples.)
---
If you want to check how many packs you've bought, you can filter your collection by expansion and count. If you disenchant extras and weak cards, counting would be less effective, but it still might help jog your memory about how many packs you've bought. 
---
All in all, I would save your money for a better bundle or just to preorder an expansion that people expect to be strong. Alternatively, you can buy single packs of each of the last 3 expansions until you hit a legendary for each one if you want to try to get the guaranteed.
---
I don’t know about my opponents, but I really fucking enjoyed machine gunning plebs with shadowreaper Anduin before Raza nerf.
---
So this is Trump's list essentially, just with 1 Plague of Flames instead of 1 Grim Rally. Congrats, I suppose.

---
They delay the quest for the surprise factor so that you're less likely to deny them heals. It's a valid strategy. Fun fact: last time I checked, quest priest is now the highest-performing archetype in the standard meta, with some lists north of 60% winrate.
---
You’re right I’ve been seeing zoolock for 2 years get rid of it’s/
---
Clip was literally taken straight from a Trolden video, edits and all.
---
I haven’t rly touched my treant deck since I’m grinding mage wins. How good is Mightree, is it worth the dust to craft?
---
I get it every game
---
I mean it’s a druid he could be at 25 health next turn lol
---
Its probably zeph and alex
---
You're legendary, even if not in legend. You're the best hearthstone player he's ever seen, surely you deserve a trophy! :)
---
So its better 25% of the time and worse never.  And youre arguing it doesn't matter?
---
This is literally rank 25 logic
---
Yep, and now we're going to get dozens of posts to rationalize those complaints. It's what the sub does.
---
Maybe I should have specified that this is for standard. The cards you mentioned are not close to viable in standard. Priest had cards moved to hall of fame as mentioned in the post. Until the next rotation these cards won't show up and therefore only worth 400 dust.
---
I really enjoy dame hazelbarcc. She’s the most unique hero and I doubt we’ll ever get anything weirder or creepier. Plus the emotes are hilarious to me
---
Dusting time
---
Staple? At what rank if I may ask?
---
Oblivitron will always be my favorite,  how it just Tokyo Drifts onto the battlefield. I miss the week or two that was viable during Boomsday release.
---
monkaH
---
How do you know what playing Nithogg looks like? 
---
Lol I tried it in a highlander shaman deck that I gave up on. I can’t remember it’s animation
---
I hope you all learn from my mistake! Also: Merry Christmas 🎁🎄😊
---
Let me know when we reach that second phase. To me it looks like people have just shifted to whining about other things.
---
I have a golden whizbang because I just wanted to see gold because I didnt get jealous when anyone played golds. I just wanted them.
---
Even without that I don’t see how this card could be better. It’s perfect imo
---
Alright I kinda agree. I don’t watch trolden because the hype retro music is irritating and too many zooms feels corny
---
But that’s kinda the YouTube formula for laughs nowadays
---
Ahh so just RNG fiesta them? :P
---
U open packs during games??
---
Basically but that’s what makes reno mage so powerful. Sure you can only run singles but nothing’s stopping you from discovering extras and mage has some of the best things to discover
---
Oooh thought this was about battlegrounds 😎
---
I’ve been waiting ages for a VS snapshot of this meta, and a slight delay is disappointing but ah well
---
Also I’m pretty sure I lost this matchup as priest a few days ago due to power of creation with khadgar and I couldn’t draw another clear lol
---
Agreed so much.
---
It's been so long since I liked the music, animation and flair of a legendary. I liked the music so much that I searched for it online. Too bad the full song is only a minute.
---
Varian also has really cool music.
---
That's fair, though it looks like Bwondsami is still being run in combo priest lists so either way I'd argue that should come off the list
---
There will never, ever be a deck that wins that someone won't be bitching about as "unfun" because, when you get all the way down to it, losing isn't fun and if you're losing to some particular deck, you're going to hate it. This is why I'm rarely in support of "fun" being used as a criticism. Too often it's just shorthand for "but I want to be winning with the decks that *I* like to play."
---
Bwonsamdi was seeing play in combo priest to tutor for the Lightwardens, Beaming Sidekicks and Northshure Clerics that were still left in your deck. I'm not sure how common combo priest is these days, but I wouldn't say Bwonsamdi is a safe disenchant given his history of inclusion in that deck.
---
Arugal is great in book of spectres mage, which I have a positive wr with at rank 5.
---
Hagatha is a must in any control deck, she is literally a win condition, being great even in wild.
---
The boomship is necessary for some combo decks, mainly mecha'thun, and is great in big warrior decks (although that's restricted to a wild deck with not so great winrates and seriously high dust costs)
---
Zihi can be a monster card depending on the meta, just because it isn't good right now doesn't mean the card is bad.
---
Everything else you mentioned is trash though, I agree. However gonk will always have a special place in my heart for how unique it is.
---
Resurrect is fine in premise, but Blizz refuses to make it balanced. Its never been an interesting midgame deck that just keeps the synergy up though resurrects, theyve never created minions for priest that get better or more interesting when resurrected, theyve never even played with the flavor of it. 
---
Since it first existed it was abused, and Blizz was happy that finally a deck existed that wasn't the same old combo from base set. Then they just relied on it too much and now here we are. Maybe you enjoy playing it, but it is without a doubt the creator of some of the least fun games in the history of HS. And they just KEEP DOUBLING DOWN on it. Its like how the set after Barnes fucked everything, they released the recruit keyword. They just cant learn these lessons for some reason. 
---
My, and most players, ideal game of hearthstone goes back and forth and has interesting and unexpected interactions. The ideal game is not the one where I either lose immediately bc theyre gimmick counters my deck. It is not fighting the same OP minion six times. HS already has some of the strictest deck building in the world of TCGs (with only 2 of most cards and 1 legendary) and minions are balanced around that. Tons of battlecry cards are busted as fuck if you can play six of them. Destroying a random minion is fair if you only get it twice bc I can plan for it and play around it. Every time past that that they summon that fucker, it gets more unfair.
---
This is definitely a rant but no other class is as fucked up as priest, and making it more annoying, as theyve done with the "summon 2 copies of this annoying fuck when it dies" spell, is just baffling to me. Surely they've played these games? Why do they keep doing this to us?
---
Yes, I know, that's why I said that everyone has an archetype they don't like playing against. That's why I said I hate murlocs. That doesn't mean I'm gonna make posts asking blizzard to change the way murlocs work just because I don't like playing against them or with them or just looking at them in general or hearing their stupid sounds. My point is that my personal distaste for murlocs is my burden to bare since they're not broken in any way, I have no real reason to complain. Priest isn't broken either. Some people enjoy it, other's hate it, and you're just gonna have to deal with it. Just like I'm dealing with those stupid murlocs.
---
What's everyone's thoughts on this? I'm honestly not too sure how I feel about it myself. I don't know what tier I'd put it in, and I don't know how effective it'd actually be.
---
Pros:
---
I can see it being a good way to shift out of your Wrath Weavers lategame and still hang onto the stats you built up on them. Golden could obviously destroy the adjacent minions and gain twice the stats. It's more versatile in BGs than in the regular game because you can move things around to make it work better in the tavern. It'd make for another big stat minion for demons who I believe are a bit lacking even after Floating Watcher gave them what I felt was a significant buff. It drops the minions you destroy back into the pool so you could search for them again. 
---
Cons:
---
It'd be an awkward card to play. I feel like people want to see a good t6 demon synergy card come into the game, and I don't think this is t6 material. Depending on your situation it could be completely useless or quite powerful. I don't like the idea of investing in something that you hope would be amazing and having it end up useless.
---
I absolutely agree, but it would be nice if the community remembers that the next time we go on a tear of calling the devs incompetent because they failed to predict an "obvious" meta.
---
Lul, this subreddit is just going to complain about every priest archetype until the entire class is deleted from the game.
---
Not that I like the big rez priest or combo priest but it seems like priest can never catch a break on here.
---
It works really well with my highlander dragon warrior deck.
---
It can be useful as another board clear in last expansion Control Warrior.
---
It doesn't work well with Galakrond Warrior since that is just a temp deck with a Leeory finisher.
---
Losing isn’t the issue. If someone beats me then sure, whatever. The issue is that the amount of counterplay is abysmal. There is more counterplay against Shirvallah OTK paladin than against Deathrattle rogue.
---
Shit you got me
---
Can't beat King Krush.
---
It was planned for the 19th but the sudden announcement of balance changes forced them to scrap it,as the data and the write-up would be irrelevant. Can't blame the vS team for that.
---
The only card you’re totally wrong about is Bwonsamdi. That card has been and is still good in Combo Priest
---
Bwonsamdi literally sees play in Combo priest right now. The Boomship saw play in Mechathun Warrior and Control Warrior. Hagatha sees play in  all types of Control Shaman, it’s a hero card that generates infinite value. Hard disagree with most of these, it’s generally a bad idea to dust any legendary cards. If you’re going to dust any, dust the bad ones in wild.
---
Hello I'd like a baguette and a brioche.
---
What the fuck are you talking about?
---
I want Onyxia
---
Took/played a control shaman to legend ~L200.  Definitely staple.
---
LOL I did that when I was new and played against my friends big priest deck. 😭
---
It will definitely be better to get the bundle than just buying packs at regular price from the most recent sets. I would say it might be worth it just to get the legendaries but I would instead just buy the sets that are rotating with gold until you get a legendary from each set. It's also pretty common for blizzard to throw out a bundle every month or two. I would just wait for a bundle that has better packs, especially DoD specially if you dont plan to spend much. Also, most cards from the 3 rotating sets aren't that good so it's not worth getting cards from them other than the legendary for the 400 dust. Hope this helps
---
I had this when I had weak internet are you on wireless? Reset router and reload game
---
Safurel#1821 NA Trading 80g quest. You first. If you can read this it's still available.
---
Blademaster Circle of Healing hasn't been a powerful opening since, like, Grand Tournament but okay.
---
Also, no there's no way to tell how many packs from each set you've opened
---
Just because they weren't successful in making it viable doesn't mean it wasn't what they pushed. All bar two of the priest cards for this expansion were for a lategame control priest.
---
Northshire, Tol'Vir, Blademaster+Circle is definitely still strong. Have you played any Combo Priest recently?
---
So it doesn't work with Paladin hero power for example?
---
Murloc aesthetics are a purely subjective thing to hate. The gameplay isn’t significantly different from pirates or other aggro styles of play.
---
The criticism of priest isn’t the class or the aesthetics it’s that every viable build falls into the same style which isn’t really that fun to play against. There are non-trivial differences between the two and your dislike of murloc decks just doesn’t really seem all that relevant.
---
How the hell pirate warriors up there baffles me . deck sucks or im unlucky
---
A deck which left a bad experience will always seem broken and overpowered, even if every part of it is weaker.
---
Shaman galak is slower, leverages board control worse, and has a weaker early game, exacerbating the previous issues. But the second a quest galak puts 32/32 in stats on the board, it feels as bad as it did when an og deck did it twice on t7 and t9.
---
Cancer was the pre nerf Galakrond shaman. Face hunter was born out of necessity.
---
No
---
It drove down the global winrate to 36%. If they wanted it to be competitive, they were hilariously wrong about the necessary power level.
---
SECRET AGENT COMING THROUGH
---
Then why can Eternal Servitude’s options all be taken up by different Zombeasts?
---
omg I can feel it
---
&gt;So if you have no mass removal ready you just lose. And if you do, you still waste 5 to 8 mana to clear the board and the enemy then has 10 mana to fill it again.
---
I agree. It's unfair the opponent gets their mana refilled and can play cards again.
---
Nope, miserable deck. And it's only strong against people who don't do anything in the first 3 turns. Which isn't much of the ladder right now.
---
Point is, it's a complete failure of an opening for a control deck.
---
A 6 mana 8/12 with Taunt split between two bodies isn’t “just good,” it’s incredible. Before DoD if anyone ever suggested a card of that power level it would be downvoted into oblivion.
---
Go eat some poop, please.
---
My #1 holdout is Alexstrasza—Dragon form or High Elf form, either way, but preferably both. I would rock that portrait so hard. Totally in favor of them adding more portraits by the dozen.
---
By the time deathwing is able to played, you oopoent probally has more than 12 damage on board.
---
gotta love when your opponent starts buffing the party crashers

With all due respect to the poster, do not consider this a guide. I always love original content though!
---
Should've started leveling in end game to look for a could poison units, probably would have won if you had
---
They've been working on fixing the "sandwich" issue since like the week (or one week after) open beta started (almost 2 months). 
---
I'll believe it's fixed when they make an official announcement about it being fixed *AND* there is evidence of it being fixed.
---
So you think a deck should be nerfed so the deck you're playing, which loses to galak shaman anyway, can win and you're also missing a major card from the deck. Ok buddy.
---
Seems like they could probably just not show how many have pressed the ready button and that problem could be avoided.
---
Sometimes it be like that
---
this ain't it chief
---
Tell us more about how getting good determines what your opponent drafts and/or gets randomly.
---
Even before the rise of priest, pirate warrior was a counter and galakrond shaman started running witch's brew. The meta responded *fast* to face hunter, probably because it's really easy to tech against.
---
&gt;beating down the same minion 20 times

HSReplay says Warlock's winrate is 50.5% (third-highest, Rogue is 4th at 49.9%)
---
*dad
---
No it gud
---
stop trolling
---
The new Dragonsbane intro is also fun.
---
Mine was 114/114. That was with a Shark though.
---
oh god he just ran in
---
That makes it better.
---
Close the app isn't a fix. Anyone can do it.
---
It might be one of the most powerful right now, but decks other than zoo are dragging down the class winrate.
---
Cobalt guardian is already very good and seen a lot in high mmr... not sure what game you’re playing
---
That would be waaaayyyyy too good.
---
But it does fix the solution therefore it’s a fix...
---
LMAO
---
I feel like the percent of times that someone gets offered this and they don’t have any duplicates has to be very low
---
I took a shaman list to legend without it so, not staple. I haven't seen Hagatha in the DoD expansion and you dont need her for galak shaman. Im not saying you cant, but its not a must include.
---
You’re going to have an aneurysm if you ever try to play Magic the Gathering. It can cost often cost that much, or more, for a single card lol.
---
r/woosh
---
What happened to the whole priest is garbage issue? I'm genuinely lost.
---
That would require me to actually open one.  
---
Ba-Ziiinnnnggggg.

They leave your hand. But they just disappear

I wish they would add it to. Would really let demons, beasts and other comps to work better

It's true that's the right play, but I cant blame people for not playing around secrets that aren't even in the meta. If you hardly ever see misdirection it's not hard to forget that it's a possibility.
---
Seriously, what's wrong with beating cancer with cancer anyways?
---
I mean personally I love face hunter, as it's a staple of Hearthstone at this point.
---
It would kill it.
---
How do I even achieve such awesome stats?.... i‘m not just feelin‘ like a noob but I‘m sure that I am!
---
I was afraid of the shadow word death, but luckily he didnt have it, and all he could do was resurrect all of his taunts.
---
No, you have to see it like a rock-paper-cisor. Priest hard-counter Face Hunter, but is easily beaten by other decks that usually lose against face hunter
---
I had a game where i played against 3 enemies. First round someone random i cant remember, then syndragosa-george-syndragosa-george-syndragosa-george-syndragosa-(george died so someone else, and then i died as well to someone random)
---
Wait, that's illegal
---
The game used to show you that kind of stuff at the end of the month ("rank 5 congrats! You are in the top n% of our ranked players!"), buy I don't think it does anymore
---
Theres a scene with the water in the cup when the T Rex is near and you don’t see Dino, just the vibration of its footsteps
---
Thats becuase when you play galakrond, his hero power activates, would be the same if you played galakrond and use your hero power later. If you look at [Khadgar] text, you see why using your galakrond hero power as shaman for example, doesn't trigger khadgar, but PLAYING galakrond does.
---
r/accidentalitalian
---
Fair enough, but I see this as evidence that priest is in a fine spot if it can play part of the meta and hard counter something. Other decks are dependent on being good against other good decks too. That's my point of view I guess.
---
You will climb faster if you use a agro face deck
---
Now this is my type of humor
---
Welcome to the party pal!
---
You're right, I meant bugstone.
---
That's not how it works. Don't try to full craft decks. Use your cards.
---
Tou live up to your name.  Ppl who playes that shaman trash were bad ppl and players.  Try to not net deck for once in your life
---
bees? theyre dragons
---
I don't need to. The game is coded so that it removes all treats despite it being different art. Bringing another card into this does not change the way the interaction between flik and treants work
---
Maybe they should nerf Brann - oh wait he’s not even in the game and some clown with 4K MMR is trying to pretend he has merit in a balance discussion.
---
Thanks
---
If a deck is relying on one single other deck being popular in order to be remotely playable, that deck has a problem. Not only a problem with its longevity (especially since, for a deck to be *that* popular, it will likely be nerfed) but also how enjoyable the deck is. After all, this is a game. Not a win-lose simulator.
---
hot girl make tree hot too
---
no offense, but it doesnt look that homebrew. seems like a standard galakrond warrior with slight twists.
---
Strongest one should be Raza Priest. Most fun was Mill Rogue, if that counts.
---
Wow. You're insulting a guy for seeing things differently than you do and getting a different experience than you did. If you can't see why you're such a douche then you're hopeless.
---
Try simply explaining things to somebody rather than go straight to insulting jackass. Not everyone sees things the same as you. Get off your high horse and think you should have the right to be a dick for no reason
