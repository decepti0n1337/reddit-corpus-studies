Trust me. As a magic player, you would NOT want more "elusive" cards.
---
---
---
I mean you're right, there's not a perfect word, but it is much more intuitive than elusive and warded
---
I only respond to relevant comments not to illogical comments unless I feel generous enough to disprove them. Kind of like yours. But feel free to try again.
---
Where you might as well just play Rag and FLJ lol
---
Ironically Fire-Eater was amazing in Odd. and they probably had to over cost the Spirit by 1 to make it even, since it would've been busted in Odd. 
---

---
Perhaps, if they do buff some Rastakan cards, they can start by de-adjusting all the cards that they hold to tweak around Genn and Baku.
---
But what if your opponent played [[Spellward Jeweler]] on their turn?
---
Found the whale

i'd guess that was right after he said "/u/StanTheManBaratheon you need to leave, this is for debate team members only"
---
let me know if you can think of a single reason the pricing model for adventures was worse for the playerbase than the 'give me $500, and i'll give you 90% of the cards' model is. i've had this same conversation many times and not a single blizzard shill has ever been able to give an actual reason. i hope to god you're being paid by blizzard, because the alternative is too depressing.
---
Haha right??
---
xD It‚Äôs a cheat-code for insta-rank-1
---
Ogre
---
Not Tha bad honestly.
---
So while your analysis is accurate for the most part, the pitch for elusive is because the WoW trading card game used that keyword.
---
didnt spend it elsewhere just the thought process of spending certain amount of money on something else did it for me.
---
for example i dont really need item x for hobby y but it would make more sense to buy x than spend 50 bucks on hearthstone, why spend 50 bucks on hearthstone if i wouldnt even spend 50 bucks for item x i would be more happy with but dont really need.
---
hope u got me :3
---
&gt; Just to clarify, you feel better about spending $1000 on something and selling it for $300 than just spending $500 on something?
---
It's not like that at all. The numbers you're just throwing out are not representative of my situation. I'm something of a collector, and I have been for a very long time.
---
For example, I bought an unlimited Timetwister in 2008 for $250. I could easily sell it for $2k now. But, I've also bought hundreds of dollars worth cards that did not appreciate in value (though, I did get a joy from them incommensurate to the money I paid).
---
Now that I think about it, if I were to sell my collection now, I would probably turn a profit (not adjusted for inflation), or at the very least, break even. 
---
The point I'm trying to make is that I've spent a few hundred bucks over the years on hearthstone, but the return for that is $0. I don't think I've lost that much money on paper Magic the Gathering, if I've even lost money at all.
---
I think Lynx spirit would be pretty cool at 2 mana. It is a card that actually fits in decks with a lot of small minions, but those are tempo oriented decks that cannot easily afford a "3 mana do nothing in this turn" card. At two mana the tempo  loss could be compensated more easily, I don't think it would be too oppressive.
---
Hm, this makes me think:
---
I wonder if cards that target minions can target [[Shimmering Courser]]?
---
IIRC, when played [[Yogg-Saron, Hope's End]] is technically the entity casting the spells, not "*you*".

10/7/5 | Battlecry: Cast a random spell for each spell you've cast this game (targets chosen randomly).  
---
Not gonna read this shit, arguing for the sake of arguing . It‚Äôs a good idea to give it a keyword, who cares what it is.
---
I'm hoping someday, perhaps many years down the line after, Hearthstone is done and over with. Perhaps Blizzard will release a Hearthstone Classic that's the complete game and let's you earn packs at a fair steady rate just by doing the PvE content. Maybe even have some online.
---
If you‚Äôre playing from behind on board with a minion flood deck something has gone very wrong.
---
Absolutely. The value gain from Boom is insane. Trying to win a game vs a Boom on turn 7 will tell you exactly how powerful it is.
---
I only see one thing in this picture: lethal.
---
The only expansion I preordered was KotFT, just because I could see how powerful the death knights were gonna be.
---
I spent a little bit of money on Ungoro and KnC, but since then Inhavent spent a dime on the game.
---
I'm in New Zealand, and the preorder prices are like 80 bucks and 130 bucks.
---
*Fuck that*
---
I'm not gonna spend the same amount I spent on a perfectly competent triple A game just to get some dinky little cards in hearthstone. As a now f2P I find that I can earn enough gold to get a few packs and a legendary from each new expansion.
---
The problem for me is that the prices are way too high for something digital (I can understand MtG pack prices, because they're REAL PRINTED CARDS). The way Blizzard nerds cards doesn't sit well wih me either. I've had the rogue quest since ungoro, and it baffles me how they just change it without any consumer approval.
---
Imagine if Wizards of the coast suddenly stole your mythic rare card and changed the text on it then gave it back, without you having a say. It's pretty crazy.
---
I'm surprised the combination of randomly gotten cards (basically gambling), predatory pricing, and swift, sudden changes to super rare cards players (may have) spent a lot of money to aquire, hants resulted in some kind of legal action or issues.
---
Paladin is currently #7 out of the 9 classes right now, and the new cards seem to favor Priest, Shaman, and Warlock. Given that Paladin is only #7 (just ahead of Priest and Warlock), you can guess what rank they'll be on the ladder here soon.
---
This. Good one expansion only keywords that sadly couldn't really make it through because the minions were very weak.
---
&gt;and then you can't play 7 out of 9 classes. 
---
Okay. In all of your previous comments you've been acting as if the person you were responding to was advocating for disenchanting 7 classes, not 2. I'm not weighing in on the disenchant 2 strategy. Merely pointing out you were extremely off base in your initial comments/severely warping the other person's point.
---
Midrange Paladin could have been a thing if equality wasn‚Äôt nerfed.
---
FLJ?
---
My first thought was Omniknight
---
Not necessarily, a big thing with minion flood decks is being able to do it many times over. You made a wide board, it got hit with and aoe so you do it again. Maybe your opponent did a cheap aoe and then refilled their own board some, so then you can play hounds.
---
In defense of my oversight, it's been a long day. Sometimes I miss the most obvious shit lol
---
basically this. i bought 6 months of wow for around 60 bucks. the gams i got is 1000 times more versatile, deep and whatelse than hearthsone. i get to enjo, all the content, drain hours and have fun.  people who feel bad about being addicted to spending money on hs really need to look outside of their bubble. their money can make them happy elsewhere without feeling bad for spending it
---
Witchwood was the first one tho. Why would they buff the second before the first and the third briefly before rotating out? Doesn't make sense to me.
---
Planning on using spirit of the dead in my desert obelisk deck, for sure expecting it to be a meme deck but that's really why i play the game, really really niche combos that almost never work, but when they do your opponent is left both confused and amazed.
---
Nothing says Bomb Warrior is going to be top tier next meta. The meta is in for a massive shakeup. Taunt Warrior may end up being the better alternative.
---
I agree on Leeroy, Omega Devestator and Conjurer's Calling. These cards are outright busted.
---
Massive Professional Company being shitty more like
---
learn how to properly play arena and the problem is solved. I got 6k gold 10k dust atm just waiting haha.
---
Good jerking. I approve
---
It's part of the Boomsday set but only impacted the RoS meta, not ones before it. I treat it as an RoS card that rotates early....
---
&gt;\*\*I hope to see someone post a screenshot of a Rogue trying to Togwaggle scheme Zephrys üòÇ
---
On the other hand, I expect a shitload of Zephrys coming into play after Rafaam.
---
I'm not super into druid, shaman, or paladin, but mechathun druid, evolve shaman, and anyfin paladin were my jam! 
---
If I disenchanted all my X class cards I would have missed out on some cool archetypes and a handful of unique (often neutral) legendaries would sit mostly useless in my collection.
---
If you need dust, disenchant pack filler as you go, you won't miss a worgen greaser, booty bay bookie, or deadly arsenal
---
? Those 3 cards were really prevalent and dominant, but they didn't make you lose to a hero power. They're able to be used in and out of odd and even, meaning they're generally more popular...
---
Hey there I took a look at your channel and your newest video was pretty good you have confidence in what your talking about but you need a bit more of a intro in your videos I found it weird such as in in your other videos you just say what‚Äôs up guys this is tempo rouge and just start talking about the deck,you do explain the deck fine and your commentary is fine but the intro is live or die if you can‚Äôt get someone in the first minute there gone and likely not coming back you need to at the very least do a hey what‚Äôs up guys today we‚Äôre gonna be playing some hearthstone and today we‚Äôre gonna be trying out... besides this your channel is good and I‚Äôll check out some of your videos (hope this helped)
---
I think I still prefer my deck for brawl.
---
Earth Shock - for bishops
---
Evil Totem - lackeys for value
---
Sandstorm Elemental - AOE
---
Lightning Storm - AOE
---
Hex - for queens/any big creatures the opponent brings
---
Walking Fountain - Life gain and easily kills any chess piece
---
Nice.
---
Craft after you open!
---
Agree 100%, all the omega cards are actually as insane as he is once you get to 10 (that is the point after all), the main issue atm is dr boom being one of the few ways to gain unlimited value thats still on standard.
---
Assign a flair or it‚Äôs gonna get nuked

While I respect the point of the comparison you're attempting to draw, I must ask why you feel a person can still claim to be invested in/a fan of a property when they're contributing to its ruination, and when they abandon it as soon as it gets too bad for them as a result?
---
Like that just doesn't make sense to me. I get the explicit definition can vary but the idea of a "fair-weather fan" exists for a reason. Would you subsequently argue that anyone who uses that term is also gate-keeping?
---
Differences between that and this is that anyone could run it.

7 would be the average, but I've never found packs to be worth it.

I think it may be worth considering if you had a card like this.  Especially with how many chances you will have to either discover this or get gifted it from a cyclone.

Can I ask where is the original picture from?

Fireside Gatherings let you open them and play with them early with other people in the same gathering. You can find them on the hearthstone website or just by googling it. You can even just set up one for yourself if you‚Äôre impatient like me :)

[[Omega Agent]]
---
I agree, this post seems pretty useless to me - it's also fairly stupid when you look at the other keywords, such as "Taunt". Hmm, so my minions are so obsessed by Soggoth giving 'em the finger that they want to kill him first? Seems logical.

If we dive into the semantics and get hung up on the meaning of these words, really, a lot of the vocabulary in this game doesn't make much sense.

10/-/- | Deal 10 damage.  
---
they probably wanted to keep the trend
---
Not in my experience
---
I mean, if you mull correctly and can kill Mountain Giants, by making huge mechs, you win, when you drop a good Kangor's, it's game over for them, unless they find lethal in like 2 turns. If you magnetise on eggs, you can kill the egg and rush the robosaur into a giant, or just leave it up. They can't really CC your eggs, so you basically have a tough minion to kill, as they usually don't run Silence either. Generally, if you get a big Taunt Egg, you win. Huge taunts can kill Grave Horrors and they often just pass attacks against them too. Getting a Divine Shield is crushing if they have big minions.
---
Even with my non-complete list without Faceless Manipulator, I generally beat Mages...
---
DAE TITANIC LACKEY?!
---

---
I mean, shouldn't SOME cards from an expansion be pretty busted? As long as it's not like GI levels of omnipresent. If it Is, just take it down to 1 card per overkill, problem solved.
---
Yeah, I really love his Youtube videos.
---
His stream is a little bit too slow for me to enjoy.
---
Awaken, my masters!
---
"Magic-Proof" is the straightforward answer, but anything with similar language is the same idea. Warded is good, Spellproof works fine, etc. I doubt that many people have a problem with anything, just make it shorter
---
Kudos
---
Truly? Huh there you go. The only notable ones I remember were Tirion and Sylvanas and now that I think more Harvest Golem and Leper Gnome. More so I remember people asking for more Deathrattle interaction until Naxx released.

I don't think pure murloc shaman uses Likkim.
---
I try to think of the value of my money spent in terms of my time spent in HS, which is a lot. I'm a daily player, some times more than an hour. I've spent hundreds on hearthstone but each dollar spent has at least an hour of gameplay attached to it. Considering what I pay to see a two hour movie, I think if HS as being a fairly good return for my money every 4 months. 
---
That said, I'm skipping Uldum. Got more important bills and enough gold/dust for one good meta deck to ride through til January.
---
I'm not trying to advocate for anyone.   I'm saying that if you think that games like this prey on addictive personalities, don't play them.  Full stop.  Reject the entire model and walk away.  Trying to have your cake and eat it to just tells Blizzard that the entire addictive thing is just fine as long as you get what you want.
---
Or just say that you don't think packs give sufficient value and you won't buy them for that reason.  That's what I do, I don't buy packs specifically for that reason.  But don't bring a vulnerable population up and just say you want another useful card or two per set.
---
Would you be happy if there was protection against duplicates for Epics but they also reduce the probability of getting an Epic such that the amount of $$ needed to acquire a complete collection doesn't change?
---
Probably not.
---
Then, you are not really unhappy about the duplicates. You just want to pay less.
---
Quality shitpost, wrong subreddit.

Um. Its a finisher card. You never play pyroblast when youre not killing someone

It‚Äôs FIXED!  It‚Äôs finally fixed!!!
---
It looks gorgeous!
---
Fingers crossed it doesn‚Äôt revert back again like it did last time.
---
and the quest is the best pally has going for it, problem is pally got like 2 reborn minions, neither which are very powerful. Some neutral ones are good but if your archetype solely relies on a minions type from neutral cards than it's not going to eb a very strong deck.
---
Dont be average. Build your own deck. The game is more fun this way. It will make you less predictable and a better player.
---
I think they cut their customer service budget and fired people, and then turned the whole goal about making money. So the outcome has been very poor service. I've had exchanges where the solution they've offered me is to literately buy more.
---
Holy hell I'm retarded lol.  There's been so many iterations of Ranica that they're all meshing together rofl
---
Show some guts man. If you really want the change you should be able to put your name behind it. 
---
Risk nothing gain nothing.
---
If you can‚Äôt beat him years after it came out with all of the new cards... you might just want to give up on the game altogether
---
It‚Äôs a strong card regardless, just that in standard it doesn‚Äôt have enough good cards to create a singleton deck just for it. However in wild the card can fit in existing archetype easily.
---
Same
---
yeah, I guess I should skillfully play around the only mode in hearthstone that is 100% rng in every aspect. silly me.
---
The reason it's expensive is because of people like you.  You paid $130 just so you could get around 25% of an expansion (which is released every 3-4 months).  You could have easily looked up the drop rates and figured out how much of a rip-off it is before you paid money.
---
They did; it just sucks.
---
Came here to say call it hexproof, then saw spellward and figured that may do better to avoid copyright issues
---
I was actually watching it live when it happened, a lot of the chat was telling him to play a specific sequence, so I‚Äôm not entirely sure if they gave him the code or chat figured it out themselves.
---
My view on this is pretty simple. If you think they are too harsh with how they run the game--stop spending money. Even better, stop playing. Anything short of that tells Blizzard you tolerate or are happy with the state of the game. 
---
I don't play this game as much as I used to, so I spend less money than I used to. Maybe that has an impact, maybe it doesn't.
---
I did too!
---
Wow, looking for 100 huh? Made sure to keep that bar nice and low in case your post for the tepid response you were no doubt expecting.
---
You're correct. It works this way in Magic as well, the rotating format (Standard) tends to be easier for new players to get into because the card pool is smaller while the non-rotating format (Wild) is easier/cheaper to keep up with once you have an established collection since each new expansion only adds a handful of competitively viable cards.
---
I opened 133 packs and got 4 legendaries. It sucks but it happens.
---
Thank you thank you thank you, *so* happy to know this really bothered someone else.
---
Can we also tone down the effect?

The bar isn‚Äôt adjustable, my friend. It starts at 100 and goes up whenever the goal is reached.

i have thousands of physical mtg cards that literally have no value lol i couldn't sell them if i tried - i love how the line you use is bandied about so often when in reality very little mtg cards hold their value at all past the expansion window they are released in
---
Rem#11552 NA trading 80 g quest.
---
How I see it, for competitive:
---
1.  Ordering.  For instance, using a Fireball from hand *then* Zephyrus to get your Fireball for Lethal.  Because Zephyrus can't see your hand you have to set it up so it sees lethal. (otherwise if you played it with 8 mana, wouldn't choose Fireball)
---
2.  The "Best Outs".  If we know what we are looking for, then we can choose *when* to play Zephyrus.  
---
  * We don't always want Twisting Nether or Tirion.  We might want to dump our hand and drop him on T8 to find a Nourish/Sprint instead.  
---
  * We want to destroy his weapon later? (Super Collider) We play against his weapon now (2/3 Warrior Spell Weapon) with appropriate mana to find Harrison or Ooze.  (if we want draw) Or play him on T3 when we are the beatdown and get a Flame Imp.  That's why *I* want to order the card pool.
---
I think the most important thing is finding *all* the cards and then grouping them to find the *best* cards.  Most cards won't matter or we won't carry about but there will be niche cases to identify in certain metas.
---
You lose so much value on cards that it's rarely worth it. When you dust a standard HS card after it rotates you still get 1/4 of its value. You sell a standard MTG card post rotation, you're looking at 10% or less.
---
I'd say shroud is the more appropriate mtg term
---
Casual players
---
We should have regular buffs on the cool cards that didnt end up being as good as expected. The middle point between 2 expansions is a great time to buff cards from an older one.
---
I'm confused. I seem to be able to play in a region regardless of where in the world I am. What exactly did you experience?
---
I was prepared to not listen to you at all and you successfully convinced me.
---
I currently have 9000 gold saved, so very likely I could get most of the cards in the expansion if I buy the $50 one. Plus I got the legendaries sorted out with the dust I have if needed.
---
I am more on the edge on if to spend that gold and buy the expansion. Or just spend a little gold to get the small amount of cards I might need. (dust or otherwise).
---
Appreciate the insights.
---
The real problem is that Blizz would use such a keyword for an expansion then go straight  back to using thr original text... so yeah I agree.
---
You tried too hard
---
Resistant.
---
crap idk the lyrics but nice jojo reference
---
I've actually always wanted Cho. I really hope I get a golden one.

Thanks for sharing your story! I got two random deathwings off of a dragon roar and won with the Boomship that I run in my deck. Good times. 12/12's for ten that wipe the board are decent. :)
---
Wait for the card with *divine shield* and *reborn *
---
Oooohhhhhhhhhhh
---
You can get all but the top 20 most expensive cards from the most recent MtG set for ~$130. That's a 344 card set.
---
Oh yeah, I forgot about that. That is one of the decks I'm looking forward to tbh.

Thanks for reminding me. I'll set aside some dust for it.

---
Ouch, that minimum reward. Hope your gold grants you better luck.
---
he drew flamestrike  was i supposed to play around 9 classes and 24 possible draw out comes?
---
Absolutely right, no contest. PREACH
---
yikes toxic incel, blocked
---
Let me show you what your argument is: If Tempo rogue was 90% of the meta Leeroy would be in 90% of the decks. If mech hunter was 75% of the meta Leeroy would be in 75% of the decks. 
---
See, that is how nonsensical. Ifs and thens don't contribute your point. What matters is current numbers. And you are trying to compare a class card to a neutral card which sees 12 times more play...
---
It's also pretty bad when you draw it early and your tutor card becomes dead weight.

Wait something would happen on the Rastakhan board?!

His argument against wild is literally the opposite of what the reality is. In standard you are significantly more compelled to buy the new expansions since they have a much greater impact there than they do on wild. Personally as a wild-only player I haven't spent money on packs since Kobolds and have always had access to every deck from tier 1 to tier 3. I think his "argument" is just sour grapes.

I don't identify with them, I don't even support them. I have stopped playing the game a few months back, I have not preordered this or the previous two expansions and in most likelyhood I will not preorder the next few. They are not rippimg me off because I have chosen to not buy the product for a while now. However it does not change the fact that this is, in my opinion, an idea that would severely hurt the game's lifespan and viability in a market designed to make money. No money, no game. There needs to be a middle ground.

"Spell-Warded"
---
I imagine the popup when you hover over such card would be "The character can't be targeted by spells and heropowers".
---
Sure, Donais is right, there aren't all that many minions that have this effect and it's not such a useful effect such as Rush or Lifesteal, which we've seen constantly after the expansions they were introduced in.
---
These have been making for good reads, I get quite a few laughs when individual cards get described. 10/10 should just do this with every card
---
Evil Heckler does actually taunt people though! He calls your mum a murloc.   
---
Also, actually the only reason Taunt works is because that's the name of the ability in WoW. If it wasn't, I'm not sure most people would understand the idea behind it.      
---
Poisonous is also a shitty keyword though, I copy this a second time as apparently these threads are popular today.  
---
 
---
 Most things that are "poisonous"  in the game should be venomous instead. (Spiders, Snakes, Wasps) and for the other things, "envenomed" would work better. The one and only case where Poisonous actually works is Envenom Weapon.
---
Why not just "Deadly"? Simple and self-evident.
---
"Poisonous" also shrinks the theme pool when Blizz wants to add new deadly minions or effects. They always have to get a poison theme going. Instead of say "Sharpen weapon" as a future card giving your weapon Deadly. Or like Guillotine Axe / Excutioner Sword for warrior which is Deadly. They can't do that now.
---
Reborn is pretty shit too. Why not Undead? They're not already reborn to begin with, and they won't rebirthe after death either. They just stand back up. Because they're undead. Irrepressible?
---
Discover is only named that because it was added in LoE to match the theme. "Choose one of 3" isn't really discovering - so you unearth 3 treasures, but discard 2 of them?
---
Assuming you have Jaraxxus available and you notice that your opponent is playing Highlander, just hold it until Zephrys has been played.
---
Anyone noticed he looks like Saxton Hale from Team Fortress 2?
---
Is this a 4 mana 7/7?
---
I totally agree. I'm just saying, there's precedent for cards that work like a keyword, but don't actually use the keyword.
---
U bet
---
I read what you said, and it's still stupid as fuck.  You don't want dups, which means you want free shit instead of opening packs and pulling cards.  DE cards you don't want or open more packs to get what you want.  Next thing you know, fucking idiots are going to want them to give no dups on rares.  Cry me a fucking river dude.  Open packs and DE shit, done.  There's a reason disenchanting is a fucking thing.  But people would rather get free shit...
---
This is the middle ground! It‚Äôs not asking for price reduction or more cards or anything of the sort! Just ‚Äúhey maybe I don‚Äôt want to potentially get 8 of the same card when I spend $80‚Äù
---
Is that really unreasonable? Is it completely beyond the pale to request something that has already been done by MTGA? No. No it isn‚Äôt.
---
You quit the game and you‚Äôre sitting here shitting on people trying to change a game they care about?
---
A no dup rule limited to golden cards wouldn't have your described effect. Non golden cards could still be duplicates.
---
Difference is I can play Overwatch on any region by buying the game once.
---
Why I see it I think it means what it says and that battlecries work.
---
Excellent explanation and suggestion! 100% agree with you!
---
Your chances to win in Brawlisum are likely highest when you can use the new expansion cards in your deck, however that's difficult if you hold back all your gold.
---
Wait, do you personally like pissing away your money in online gambling?
---
Some people do. Personally, I just like playing card games, but maybe you like opening packs.
---
If that‚Äôs the case... **don‚Äôt sign the thing, numbskull!**
---
No. It‚Äôs not a good keyword because shortening it is not worth added complexity, you don‚Äôt want a untargetable minion to be anything else than stat stick anyway
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Got me good, man.
---
Will consider ty for the feedback :D

---
I always felt ‚Äòtaunt‚Äô was a bad keyword because the vast majority of taunt minions are big burly guys or people with shields, not people drawing attention through action (a few are, but not most). Similarly but not as bad, all the mechs with divine shield are in no way divine.

Came looking for this
---
As far as I can tell, King Phaoris summons a minion for each individual spell in your hand equal to the cost of that spell. So you could have a hand loaded with large spells and flood the board.
---
It‚Äôs a cheap game compared to most other games and it‚Äôs so much more pretty and well designed. You can just not buy if you can‚Äôt afford.
---
&gt; honestly, i feel this whole thing is a giant misunderstanding.
---
Agreed
---
&gt; my comment went along the lines of "good post, but on a more serious note....." and it's a shame you chose to take it as me trying to put OP down when i fully appreciate the content.
---
See I don't think you read MY comment. B/c I specifically quoted the bit I was replying to directly. Which is the whole point of using quotes. My original comment had NOTHING to do about anything you're talking about here. This is sort of why I said you're taking this out of proportion. You're taking it somewhere that I clearly didn't respond to. 
---
&gt; as such, i took your reply as you getting offended over nothing because to me it seemed like you were trying to "take a shot" at me by putting down my opinion as well when i meant no harm to anyone.
---
I was just correcting your use of "affect"
---
That was my first thought. But then I realized that it summons a minion for each spell in your hand, so it can potentially fill a whole board with high cost minions.
---
I know crystallizing is bad for my health, but I just can't seem to quit the habit.
---
Tldr
---
I would say it is a bit better, lets say you have 4 Spells with a total mana cost of 18.
---
Then you will get 2 miniors (one 10 mana mionion, and one 8 mana minion).
---
Es bleiben im Raum: Keitel, Jodl, Kripp's und Burgdorf.

Not everyone mine is updated and working fine.
---
They're extremely different.
---
Astromancer is a hand-size based value card.
---
King Phaoris is a build-around entire-board threat.
---
You use Astromancer to generate value and proactive threats.
---
You use King Phaoris to threaten the enemy with a real bad time unless they can deal with it.
---
King Phaoris is more comparable to Dragoncaller Alanna than Astromancer.

It's a bit too close to Immune.
---
You went with Reno based on your next 27 picks?
---
Reborn isn't permanent, so it's gotta be visually striking. Divine shield and stealth are just as non subtle for a similar reason
---
Those were just examples. I don't know what your vice is that you indiscriminately spend money on. It was merely a common list to make you think.
---
Bit too prominent for my liking, but the striking blue glow of a Reborn minion is befitting its powerful effect. Making it abundantly clear visually that *this is not the last you see of this minion when you kill it* is probably very important to get into players' minds.
---
Plus it means there is no confusion distinguishing between a minion with Reborn and the minion that comes after it, since they read and look the same otherwise.
---
GREAT DAYS
---
Yeah, they've changed that at some point. It was region locked when it started.
---
You have missed my point. Hearthstone asks me to pay for random things that may benefit me. Comparing it to any other leisure activity/entertainment, which apart from literal gambling, do not ask that of me, is absurd.
---
No way to buff him? wat. There are a ton of ways he can be buffed. For example, make him a 6 Mana 6/7, so he can be played on turn 7 without losing a draw.
---
I just wrote a comment on the elusive post about this very topic. Even with those few minions where the taunt part kinda makes sense, like Annoyo-tron; what‚Äôs divine about them? Are they an ordained minister mech?

The joke before this was is that all the key word posts were shit posts the title of this was a shit post however I just wanted to voice my opinion on them because  pepole were taking it seriously
---
I'm pretty sure they just analysed every "when does Kripp play"-post on this subreddit and made the card based on it
---
No he still played for a month. IMO he simply got bored
---
This is from the newest set and I looked at the cards from the newest set already yesterday. And they have yet no meta, so hard to think of the opinion. But I don't think it will be competitive card. More of a meme card played by streamers.
---
Topdeck Flamestrike.AGAIN. Cmon man how is this guy 0-2.

And again, all you did was add to the cluster of shit posts.

Did you?
---
Do so in find a friend thread please
---
The Rise of Shadows Brawliseum is some of the most fun I've had in the game, so I hope there's another one launching this week. It's a great semi-competitive format to test out new decks/terrible theorycrafts and it's really easy to break even if you're half-decent at the game. 
---
It's also the best thing Blizzard does for budget players, yet everyone seems to completely ignore it and miss their one opportunity to get discounted packs.
---
For people who are just worried about maximizing resources, most of the tier 1 decks in the current meta don't require legendaries or epics from the new set. So unlike the last expansion, you won't be at a competitive disadvantage if you play the brawliseum before opening your packs. If you've been playing mainly as Bomb Hunter, Cyclone Mage, Token Druid, Midrange Hunter, Control/Bomb Warrior or Murloc Shaman, then you should have a pretty easy time winning 50% of your games against unrefined Uldum decks. In fact playing those decks is probably the optimal strategy if your main goal is to get them free packs.
---
If only we could get more lazy card design in the game.
---
Did you
---
It's not a good comparison. Compared to other video games hearthstone probably has the worst value possible. You can easily spend more time with say skyrim, gta v, and numerous other games at a fraction of the cost.
---
Only by comparing hearthstone to a completely different medium does it not look terrible. I mean every video game looks like good value comparing it to something that's 7 dollars an hour. You should compare it to other videogames only.
---
Hasnt he been in bad standing with blizzard lately? He was he given access to the new cards like the other streamers?
---
I still remember that guy complaining about shudderwock shaman on youtube, one of his points were exactly the same as this lol (the only way to get shudderwock is to buy packs over and over and over again until you open him from a pack, which may cost you hundreds of dollars). Btw he also got the mechanics of shudderwock wrong.

Arena has now rotating sets, some from standard and some from wild, and they mix them up every new expansion
---
I can never get this comparison. A good triple A game lasts for what, 50 hours at most? Hs can last you for about 2 years, if you only play standard.
---
No worries. Charging my phone right now
---
This is almost a good list but I would cut pyroblast for bolder fist oger.

Fireball is not enough Mana though. Mind blast also works, but only on wild.

I'm pretty sure it looks at everything you can (your hand and the board)

It wouldn't be much of a code to crack. If they cared to read this then they can consider this post a feature request to accommodate those with long-distance family/friends.

I really hope this was just intended to be a shitpost
---
Sorry but no... The thing is that even in those cases, even if it's not 100% justified in lore or if it's not technically a death or whatnot, it's still very clear what most of those keywords mean. If its deathrattle saves the thing's life, such as with anub and morrigan, it still triggers on what would have otherwise been its death or destruction. That makes sense. And while divine shield does extend beyond paladins and "holy" minions, at least its effect is pretty obvious and intuitive. Any player should see a force field around something and realize it protects it from damage. I disagree with the critique of Inspire and Combo. Lots of cards rely heavily on the player's actions, such as Sharkfin Fan. It makes perfect sense for the player to be able to interact with their own board, and with the tooltips when you hover over it, that isn't particularly confusing. Clever visual design with the glowing yellow for combo cards also helps. The distinction isn't flawless between rush and charge but again, it's easy to get from the tooltips and they both make sense individually. Both are related to speed and attacking.
---
Taunt however is not immediately obvious, and the explanation on the tooltip is murky too. "Enemies must attack this minion." How does that interact with multiple taunts? Is the opponent allowed to not attack, or are they forced to, as the card implies? That might make sense if it goads enemy minions into attacking it, as annoy-o-tron supposedly does.
---
I don't expect perfection, and I'm not saying that we should replace Taunt. It's been in the game for so long, everyone understands it after they've gone up against it a bit and figured out how it works, which is basically every hearthstone player, even beginners. However it is far worse than the other keywords in the game, despite being the most common besides battlecry. Its name makes zero sense for its application. Almost every keyword is applied to minions it thematically shouldn't be - for example, why does Vicious Scalehide have lifesteal? YET, at least it makes sense that lifesteal heals you for dealing damage. That is common in many games, as are things like force fields and deathrattles. How does taunting help it protect stuff? How does taunt help or even function? These things are often not clear just by reading the card, unlike most other keywords.
---
The saving grace of taunt is the shield icon. Unfortunately this doesn't appear until after you've played it, so a new player might not understand what silverback patriarch does until after they've played him, and even then the mechanics are unclear. The shield at least represents protection and defense of others. It's too late to change Taunt now, for sure. But protector or defender would have been better.
---
Yeah that doesnt happy very often
---
My counter argument is that all of them can be pretty fun in the right deck or right scenario so if you can have fun and win surely that's better than having fun and losing?
---
If it was a spider tank instead then your fun argument would hold more weight.
---
That's how they get you.
---
I fart in your general direction!
---
A serial killer doesn't have to be 3'4 for cops to consider him elusive. There are other things to take into consideration than size, for example, physical stealthiness, magical stealthiness, cleverness, etc. A huge creature that doesn't leave any footprints, or any magical footprints that a sorcerer can track, would both be elusive.
---
Yep
---
Everyone here is spergs lmao
---
I personally think that you should mind your fucking business.
---
They don't owe Blizzard or their fanboys anything. If they don't want to play Hearthstone on stream, it's their call.
---
Ram Wrangler uses the artwork of Crazed Hunter, which is a 1 mana wisp Hemet plays against you in tutorial.
---
But it is not "Can't attack for a turn", it is "Lose your next attack", hence the interactions with charge, windfury, etc.
---
Yikes xd
---
Nah, like OP said these creatures aren't necessarily agile / the spell protection doesn't come from their agility
---
taunt isn't based on the word but rather the ability from WoW, where certain classes could use taunt and draw all the aggro of an enemy, thus making it attack them instead of the others.
---
So getting both pre orders means two gokd legends?
---
What do you want? 150 gold for the second Quest?

---
Wow I pulled this same bucket, was feeling cheeky and went with Reno Warrior.. ended up 1-3. But was totally worth it.
---
It definitely isn't intuitive, but they are clearly struggling with representation of all the new effects at this point. It's hard when you start trying to show all the possible things on the same minion. 
---
Still, I'd rather go with something like a pulsing watermark Ankh across the entire minion. Would definitively be less "in your face" and very much fitting for the set.
---
Sucks to be a bigot like you

If you get value out of money spent over 4 months, then the cost is not high. Like if you play 1 hour a day on average your entertainment cost comes out to around a $1 per hour.

Toast is a god tier memer and wouldve made it even if his beginning came from another game. Hafu is a skilled player jn general, not just in hearthstone and likewise wouldve and has demonstrated that. Other streamers who also started off in hearthstone clearly show that they r entertaining and ppl would watch them regardless of what they stream. U r saying this as if they owe Blizzard a living cuz of hearthstone. Sure they made their name in hearthstone but guess what they gave back so much more to the community and generated so much more revenue that Blizzard should give them a goddamn gun salute for their service. Dont u think u posting this as a whole is fking insulting especially to toast cuz of the shit that the circlejerkers in the subreddit has been giving him for simply getting a chance to release a card? Clearly u dont cuz of this

I see control shaman but how will mage be control? Mage doesn‚Äôt have early game aoe (except maybe the new secret) and no late game healing. Without frost lich jaina how will mage ever have a late game comparable to other control decks? I feel like even with elysiana you‚Äôll just get run out of gas by warrior because they have boom. I think conj mage is still the way to go for the time being.
---

Easy. Tap the square, slightly blue, paving stone in front of the door three times and it opens.
---
Overkill is and understatement. That said I am totally going to lose some games with this deck in wild
---
I don't get why everyone is hyped about this card. It's only as good as Blizzard coded it and we don't know yet.
---
I would love to see an official answer from Blizzard, which we will never get for obvious reasons.
---
Probably, I'm not sure as I already had it from a couple years ago
---
Don't like hexproof. It makes me think of polymorph effects, sense the name Hex is already kinda taken. Spellproof seems good enough, warded seems even better. It tells you it's protected from all magical effects. Where Spellproof again has the word "Spell" in its name making me think it only applies to spells.
---
You really need to do something else and get off that stick you're riding.. People are free to choose to do what they want, even play TFT. They owe you nothing. Maybe do a lil less of watching streams and caring what is being play and by whom, and go do something worthwhile. This is pathetic.

those are great options there and reno decks still work with duplicates if you draw one early enough. some of the old reno decks actually ran several duplicates for this reason, so i wouldnt complain about any of those 3 op cards.
---
I've crafted after the meta has settled. I've never expected an another nerf to an already off meta deck.
---
Want me to predict the SoU meta right now? Control Warrior, Bomb Warrior, Mech Hunter, Hybrid Secret Hunter, CC Mage, and Tempo Rogue. That list was backbreaking to make lemme tell ya.
---
Your worries are reasonable. 
---
Even though I like these type of artworks too, I don't like the style hearthstone started going to. Look at the new expansions, frozen throne was the last serious themed one, we are only getting kids cartoon-like topics since. And when they changed some of the card arts to remove blood and stuff, I feel like blizzard started aiming towards kids for some reason. But hearthstone is much more comlex that a children's game and lacks the action what kids are looking for. It just doesn't make sense to me.
---
What *is* aggro then? Just Bomb Hunter? Tempo Rogue? Both of those have higher curves than Zoo, surely they should't count either right? Missile Launcher and Togwaggle clearly make those decks midrange!
---
No, its the ultimate price of the sarcasm you have to pay everytime. You gotta accept the risk that some people just wont get it. You aim to specific kind of people :P

He is hardlisted to not offer Shadowstep or Pandas.

I was going to reply an extensive answer about this sad pessimist post, but then I realized isn't worth the effort and time.
---
Fireball is VERY rarely better if you want to go face. Double the mana for 1 more face damage doesn't sound "often" better for me.
---
The highlander zoo deck wasn't really aggro, it was much more midrange.
---
There've been times in zoo's life when it's been a MR deck instead of aggro with a significant amount of top end.
---
However, current and recent iterations of zoo have definitely been aggro.
---
This guy makes more sense in a single sentence than your whole post. You basically b\*tch about a suggestion made by a user/fan, whereas this guy tries to make people understand that ingame keywords do NOT represent their exact definition from Oxford's Dictionary.
---
I think yes and no. It's not a "face" deck, but then again you never didn't run Leper Gnome when it was still alive. If your opponent isn't in dire panic by turn 7 or so, you're probably not going to win that game... "early pressure which can potentially fizzle out and then hopes for burn" just about sums up aggro to me, despite that your plan isn't just to go all to the dome. 
---
Against a control deck or a midrange deck which can go over the top of Zoo, you really are trying to beat down with as much attack points as you can and as few resources as possible clearing the other side - for the sole reason that you want to keep your guys alive to deal constant damage. Against a similarly-sized deck (aggro decks of other classes, or the mirror) \*that's\* when Zoo becomes control, where your plan is about the other person's board.
---
What settles it for me... what do you call an Aggro Warlock deck? Every other class has had one of those, but in Warlock's case is such a thing possible at all? What if I include burn and lots of cheap guys?
---
Current iterations of zoo have definitely been aggro, though admittedly past ones have been more midrange.
---
How is he a dead draw? Just play it when you get it, you get to discover a card and you get ok stats on curve. 
---
If you draw it late, you still get a relevant card. One that might just be direct damage and win the game for yiu, especially if you've exhausted yourself going face or burning through defenses.
---
Nope, they did that to avoid edwin shenanigans.
---
&gt;Giggling Inventor was nerfed entirely because of Quest Rogue.
---
Straight up untrue. It was stupidly powerful in that deck but it was nerfed for far more reasons than that, it was in almost every deck.
---
It would be completely broken by fireworks tech.
---
There's no way you know exactly how it'll all shake out yet. If you're already bored, maybe it's time for you to take a break from the game.
---
Tombs of Terror is the name of the new single-player adventure which will come out next month.
---
&gt;Warrior has ~15% winrate against anti-control Hunter
---
source?
---
It was in the patch notes, you can check
---
Also Eureka shaman.  Heck, they even run ancestral healing, and if muckmorpher dies as a Colossus he comes back as a 10/1.
---
I think maybe you're being a bit pedantic about some things. It feels a bit silly to use the difference between poisonous and venomous as an argument as if the term not strictly being correct is totally rendering you unable to grasp the function of the keyword. I do agree that something like **Deadly** would be better as a keyword to serve that purpose, but with that said I think **Poisonous** is fine for all intents and purposes if you ignore the flavor restrictions that you mentioned. Your arguments for **Elusive** being fine as a keyword are pretty valid, but I would definitely argue against Soggoth being elusive in any sense of the word. And looking at the full art from the card, Soggoth is depicted as being as large as mountains even if that may or may not be an accurate representation of what it looks like in other Warcraft lore/titles (I'm honestly not sure).
---
I agree with you. It's a strong card but ultimately I think it will end up being cut from most lists as they get more refined. It just doesn't have any synergies (outside of Quest Shaman, who might keep it if the deck goes in a value-oriented direction) and most Tier 1 decks these days are very tight lists that highly value synergistic cards over just throwing in high-value Legendaries.
---
&gt;From your perspective, will it be ok to spend $80 on this expansion? It's of course a choice as the game itself is F2P, so I'm curious if people really buy the big pack deals or not.
---
I have spent it, well ¬£70. Because I look at Hearthstone as 1 of my hobbies. ¬£15-20 per month (ie the cost over the life of each expansion) doesn't seem bad at all to me, for something I play pretty much every day.
---
&gt;That‚Äôs why keywords that are easily explained by a few words are better left like that, instead of adding a keyword. It doesn‚Äôt punish older players, who mostly remember effects from the card themself, and newer players can easily figure out what they do by reading the card.
---
You can hover over cards to get descriptions of their keywords. This has been in the game ever since its inception. The solution to the "problem" you're pretending exists has been in the game for five years.
---
Making more of them is probably a bad idea, you will end up with useless ones being drawn instead of the beefy ones.
---
Maybe you were trying to play a Sorcery during combat.
---
I dont know man, I feel like that frogs looking at me funny he disreapecting me
---
But Recruit and Echo need to be keywords because there's so many of those
---
I've though about it, but the problem is that the copy of the prelate is going to stay as a 2/2 no matter what buffs you put on before copying it.
---
Did you buy dalaran heist with gold and still have 8.5k gold in your pockets? That's impressive.
---
You used to be able to see the art on the cards
---
Usually some of trumps' one stars end up sleeper 5 stars, so I am not worried.
---
"I must attack the minion with taunt"
---
Said when you try to attack something other than the minion with taunt.
---
"Discover a Recruit card" won't ever discover cards that have an effect similar to Recruit, but don't have the Recruit keyword on them, meaning that there's a difference between having the Keyword and not having it.
---
I think he killed Vanish while Mind Blast went along with because it fit.
---
Thought i'd try to start a discussion on the matter and see if people had any interesting ideas.  Also there might be some blizzard comment on the matter too.  I know Grandmaster Specialist format shed light on this same matter with warrior vs warrior matches taking seemingly 12 hours a match.  
---
I think adding some kind of "first card" system may work.  So you have around 30 seconds or something to play your first card then you get another 30 after you do.  Kinda speed up the process of roping for virtually no reason.  
---
Doesn't sound like that great of an idea now that I write it down but yeah.  What are your ideas / thoughts?

Hunter Quest and Warrior Quest are worse.
---
I think the original joke was for Yes Paladin, because when someone looked at the deck they were in such awe over how easily the game could be ended that all they could say was "Yes".
---
yea but like 200/247 cards. thats a nice headstart.
---
Not entirely unreasonable, assuming you dont play elysian until you're fairly low on cards you've probably played all your singleton dependent cards.
---
If you're playing elysiana any earlier you're probably going to lose fatigue anyway
---
plz blizzard
---
Are they giving dust refunds for this nerf yet?
---
Deathrattle (Ankha) Rogue looked extremely strong when Dog built it (notably circumventing Trump's main flaw of the card by having the only cards of lower mana than Ankha be two Witchwood Pipers). Not sure if it'll actually hold up, but he got a near 100% winrate with that deck even when others were playing Battlecry Shaman and such.
---
I think it may be a lot worse than it sounds.  Every game would be very same-feeling.  I think a version where you pick, let‚Äôs say, 10 cards and get him for the other 20 slots may be interesting though.
---
poor guy thought he had discovered the new expansion before this one even launched
---
Oh that's a fair point actually, that will probably be the real flood. Good thinking !
---
Think about all the games, particularly mobile games, that you‚Äôve played or installed. You have a low tolerance level for free to play games, so even that overly complicated the game. And particularly this specific ‚Äúkeyword‚Äù, which is featured on only 1 classic card I believe, and a very small handful of other cards, less then 15 total, there‚Äôs no reason to add another learning piece to the game
---
Why are you keep posting this every hour? Does Trump pay you to advertise?

Elise is never the pick.. does no one know hard it is to draw a specific card TWICE in arena? ESP as Hunter. The Ungoro Elise was a mediocre pick back then, and that was only one card.
---
You‚Äôre sure to have at least a few good battle cries with Brann. I would expect Elise to happen once, maybe twice throughout the entire run
---
Poisonous should be an effect like 'this minion kills amy minion that kills it'. So its actually poisonous, the attackig minion kills and eats it, then dies
---
Blatant decoy is closer to a wagon then a mech it just holds things.  
---
And not a [[meat wagon]].
---
But it does make you wrong to claim that I'm an idiot for saying a different word fits the situation better.
---
Another example of a situation where this might come up: If you're being asphyxiated, you're going to say that you're choking if something is lodged in your throat, vs strangled if something is constricting it. They bear similar meanings, but carry different connotations.

We don't even know how much content it'll provide. Blizzard easily could have just done a lot of content on Dalaran's heist and then got lazy on the next content.
---
Same; keywords are a useful construct and I'm firmly on the side that it's better to have a quick and prominent word that can be affiliated with a pop-up description then to spend forever lamenting that there is no word that perfectly describes the mechanic in question.  
---
Frankly, the HS team's continued anxiety about player confusion in spite of HS being a digital game and therefore having the platform to provide constant reinforcement opportunities (btw, generated cards really SHOULD appear when you select a generating card in the collection, ie quest rewards, tokens) is...overbearing, and MDonais's response to the elusive post does nothing to help that impression.
---
Well now I am.
---
Jerk.
---
They could tie it to single player components of expansions, it'd let them say it's exclusive content.
---
Clash just peddles chests, they could do it like that, add in a hero, and golden cards would definitely be worth it or even dust for rewards.
---
Keep it simple Golden's, a hero, a card back, a board, and packs.
---
They could add an extra challenge, one a day for the entire expansion for a reward that day, and they stack.
---
It has been explicitly stated that the next solo content will be similar to the dalaran heist
---
No, they won't arrive until the set releases.
---
nah, blizzard tends to drop archetypes stone cold once they decide to.
---
You noticed you are rank 19?
---
A lot of the art in the base game came from the wowtcg
---
You cant see if your minion can attact or not and when you have no time it may confus
---
Silence or transform effects are the natural counter to Lucentbark (and magnetic decks as well.) Shaman has good access to these effects using Earth Shock and Hex. Control Shaman does not perform as well as Murloc or Aggro Overload strategies, but it will be better at countering those specific opponents.
---
almost all of those do not have the variance of old tuskarr totemic
---
and then someone will connect it in a way so that it just plays the game for you
---
wait no
---
The salt is real for this poor warrior soul.
---
TIL there's still people online who don't know how to perform a basic Google search
---
It's progress and easier on the wallet for the average player. Among numerous other reasons, they could monetize emotes and animations but they don't need to and that's what I think your afraid of.

actual cards?

Why would I be afraid of it? I‚Äôm just saying there‚Äôs not a reason for them to put in that extra effort when everything is fine and making money as is. If they did, would I get it? Yeah. I love the game, but there‚Äôs no point in it. Do I agree it would be neat? Sure. Do I think it‚Äôll ever happen? No.
---
Can confirm. It either happens or it doesn't.
---
Please stop posting these. It's an epidemic at this point.

I opened 133 packs and only got 4 legendaries. It sucks but it happens

\&gt;tier 3 at best
---
Dude its...like right there in front of you.
---
Nah this is shitty of them and Blizzard deserves every cent they have made from this product.
---
Very few people go as in-depth as Trump into explaining the logic behind his star reviews. This is why i enjoy watching his reviews the most, despite not always agreeing with some of his predictions.
---
I still haven't picked up Liadrin. MMOs are just so boring, it feels impossible to get to the parts of the game that actually look like fun.
---
This actually sounds like fun. Although I think each game would play out very similar to the last, especially the early game.
---
Is it better to listen to Trump or Kripparian? Who is better at this kinda stuff?
---
what you mean +1/+1? Elise is a 5/5?
---
Playing the game
---
&gt;And now,...
---
That's a very narrow metric. What about all the time inbetween WotoG's release and now? 
---
I mean, same applies for GvG. GvG was a huge power spike for a very, very, very long time. The kind of decks and cards that see play changed, even the archetypes for each class that get support, but GvG was one of the more powerful sets for a long time and you put it in bottom 3 because it's not used much *right now*.
---
Actually, this technically makes perfect sense. Shudderwock used as the ability upon Siamats, if she's dead and shudderwock survives, then another Siamat is played the benefit still applies
---
The classed where almost everything was 1 star will probably bite him in the butt lol.
---
X22#2237 EU quest trade

Blood Manos begs to differ.
---
Singleton hunter actually looks really strong, but that's about it
---
It‚Äôs almost like priests classic set should be completely redesigned because of how horrible it is
---
Dragon priest, imo, was the only "fair" deck they've had.  All the others required literally no skill and you could just afk till turn 5 then win.
---
Bo3 and Bo1 are very different
---
Whether it's \* worth\* the price or whether it should \*have\* a price are two different thing. I argued for the latter, not the first.
---
For me it's 6pm (BST)
---
I really wish they would revamp Priest's basic set.  Give them better removal, get rid of DS/IF, give them the tools to support a Priest that can stick minions without it being a lethal condition, that actually heals its minions, and can maybe make non-massive-swing plays for once by resurrecting moderate minions and making use of deathrattle synergy as something other than a draw engine?  Maybe trade Velen for Vol'jin as a healthier evergreen legendary?
---
Www.questshare.com
---
I would be excited if Paladin didn't get the worst set in history
---
No fucking way was Highlander Priest uninteractive and an Auto win. It was insanely powerful but still required a lot of thinking
---
**Underbelly Angler** isn't really that RNG depending and if you leave it up for a turn or two you will most likely lose no matter what cards were RNGed off of it. Of course it feels bad when they get another Angler but most of the time that doesn't happen and it really isn't what determines the game.
---
**Lackies** aren't really high variance RNG either as all of them are around equal in power level.
---
**Swamp Queen** is expensive and requires a lot of resources in general to utilize.
---
With **Hagatha** you don't lose because of bullshit RNG spells you lose because they keep producing a bunch of resources to throw at you.
---
**Conjurers** really isn't RNG at all except for the very very very small time that they get a taunt off a giant otherwise you know exactly what's coming.
---
**Astromancer** isn't even played anymore and when it was it had pretty low variance overall.
---
**Power of Creation** has low variance as the majority of 6 drops are of an equal power level.
---
**Magic Trick** is also low variance and low impact as it can only get you spells that cost 3 or less.
---
**Mana Cyclone** is once again a card that you don't lose to because bullshit RNG you lose to because they just generate more resources than you with the card.
---
**Burglar** and **Blink Fox** are high variance but **Toggwagle** and **Lackies** aren't. 
---
There have been far far far worse RNG cards and its actually gotten much better. Babbling Book, Primordial Glpyh, Piloted Shredder, Tuskarr, Firelands Portal, Dr. Seven, Unstable Portal, Flamewaker, Implosion, Yogg just to name a few. It's not just about the level of variance but how much that level of variance effects the outcome of the game and the majority of the cards you mentioned if not all of them have their variance have very little impact on the game unlike some of the early cards.
---
I personally couldn't care less if they HOF Inner Fire, but I know for certain that this sub will still complain about any Priest deck that's Tier 2 and above.
---
kinda feel like you saw a certain post here with many upvotes and decided to copy it lol
---
Thats exactly what I meant. They are/were barely tier 1 at one point, and that was long time ago. Things can change, of course, but the push must be really high and still playing duplicates normally is better, unless the highlander cards are specifically needed for a combo (elise only comes to mind). And highlander druid wont be as strong as other tier 1 decks in wild, so yeh... zephyrs is a bad craft for wild, better craft it when it actually proves to be usefull.

These payed adventures are really taking a toll on the amount of packs I can open at the start of each expansion.
---
NevynStorm, you should go add him/her as a friend
---
Can't wait for people to get back to his videos and realise how stupid were they for mocking about being right
---
You don't hate it as much also because the variance matters a lot less for winning. Getting a good roll in Blink Fox is way less impactful than Piloted Shredder or Tuskar Totemtic or Primordial Glyph.
---
I'm not confident about that one.  A lot of people have said that current secret hunter doesn't run many duplicates, but I kinda feel like they're exaggerating how many tools it'll have for pushing its earlygame and the payoff of Zephyrs/Brann finishers, but it's definitely the one that looks the most promisng rn, given Hunter's overall power.
---
I like your idea, but I guess that effort is a little too much work to be worth it. In the long run I guess HSreplay will offer a detailed analysis of cards offered in which board states. For the short term a bit of manual data collection will help a lot to see broad trends. I for one am sure after watching two days of "theorycrafting streams" that Zephyr got a far to high affinity to tech cards and removal attached to bodies (E.g. BGH and MCT). And especially hex/polymorph get's offered nearly never, even in cases were it could turn arround whole games.. Brawl and (Mass)Silence are offered sometimes but would be objectively best cards more often than Zephrys offers them.
---
And that's only from 2 days, so I guess we will crack the basics on day 1 and after 1 week we will have good guides with detailed data driven analysis following therafter.
---
I don't understand why they wouldn't introduce Elusive. And why on earth did they remove Enrage? Why?
---
unfortunately that doesn't work, you can't find/add anyone by their nicknames ):
---
Did you play any games after this one? If not you could have just added last played opponent
---
I agree it should be removed...but I really don't want 2 more "1 mana: Heal your face for 5 and toss this card in the garbage".
---
There has to be something more creative to fix priest being stupidly overpowered and stupidly underpowered every other expansion...
---
