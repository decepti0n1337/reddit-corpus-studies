I figured there wouldn't be a lot of people who cared. I was just curious if anyone else had thought of it.

Keening banshee is good in arena. Whenever you mill cards, just think that they were at the bottom of the deck and you weren‚Äôt gonna draw them.

I'd choose zilliax, it's probably the safest choice, cairne and black knight are greedier. 
---
Hero cards aren‚Äôt bad by default just not always well balanced, 20 turns of never ending huge lifesteal rush minions is never going to be fun to play against for instance. 
---
All I‚Äôm saying is that hero cards should be about getting an interesting game altering hero power where the battlecry is a tool to make sure that the card isn‚Äôt too low tempo. Hero cards shouldn‚Äôt be spells with a gimmick hero power and some armour taped on the side, eg zul‚Äôjin and this card above.
---
Tfw Dragon Roar is still in the third bucket
---
My deck could potentially be very greedy with the Mind Control and cause its so early in the draft. I was leaning more towards zilliax tho too.
---

---
it's conciderably above average
---
Interesting.. i get that it offers slightly better stats, ive only recently started trying to get into arena after a long time of ladder.. ill consider it better next time
---
I see a lot of people picking hyldnir aswell.. i would have thought the loss in choosing trades is often worse than gaining an extra health stat point but ill pearn as i go
---
I just always felt like banshee was a riddiculous card :)
---
Hopefully you hit 'em with the "Greetings" or "Thanks" before popping off. 
---
I love how people still underrate this card. 
---
Gives me so many wins just because they ignore it and go face and then get smashed 2 or 3 turns later.
---
Literally, i ended up losing

Hey man, congrats getting to rank 5 so early on. That's awesome!

As far as a budget option I think crazed chemist is pretty good. For a strict leeroy replacement I'd go with Reckless Rocketeer. 6 mana 5/2 charge. A little worse, but might give you that last burst with a cold blood on it.
---
As far as strategy, make sure secure the board by making favorable minion trades when possible. I like trying to muligan for Argent Squire and a Cold Blood against slower decks ie. Control Priest, Warrior. You can play the Squire, drop another one drop on turn 2 and Cold blood your still divine shielded argent squire for 5 damage turn 2. And then they have to respond with at least 2 removal options or you can keep hitting them with 5 to the face. Win win. 
---
Let me know if you have any other questions i can help you with, my dude, and thanks for the support :)!
---
its kinda sad that the raven only had something to do with witchwood, felt like the mammoth was way more thematic for all 3 expansions.
---
Kind of an interesting question but only cause I never played WoW and don‚Äôt know the lore. Does WoW have God‚Äôs? And do the gods create mana? If so I assume the card is referring to the lingering mana after you cast a 5 cost spell. 
---
The voice line when you play him is "Ahh, sweet essence." So, I'm assuming whatever essence he's on about tastes like ambrosia

Probably just a bug .. I checked my transaction history and it shows all the purchases .. Just email support if it continues this way ..

---
But wasn't Doctor Boom a 1-star card?
---
Literally me when I first started! Everyone has to start somewhere. :)
---
depends on the number of cards you have, but it's mainly preferences. As for me, I'm saving up and I'll disenchant all my other cards
---
I'll also probably end up paying for some packs but that's another story

Is there a tournament database or something similar available on internet? If these cheaters took part in 40 HCT events last year then ok maybe that's a big punishment. But I watch lots of tournament on twitch and judging from the names I see, I'd be confident in saying that almost no one plays *nearly* as many tournaments.
---
This would be a good time for a master plan...

Well, Tencent pushed out a survey a few days ago (in chinese) asking if people would be interested in mobile versions or League of Legends based versions of auto chess, so it's likely you'll see tons and tons of clones pop up in the Apple and Android mobile stores soon.
---
1. What archetype are you running 
---
2. I‚Äôd charge the spellstone up to max before playing it (not hard to upgrade and more value)
---
3.  Your deck seems pretty good, if u post a decklist I can make suggestions on what to add
---
&gt;One slip up
---
Way to downplay the issue. Cheating is not a "slip up". It's a voluntary action to gain an unfair advantage on their opponents. 
---
Thanks, I might disenchant some because I still have a fairly small collection
---
Honestly curious- how would you react if you noticed your 5 yo kid bm-ing? 
---
The point is that keywording it would allow Blizzard to create cards that tag the mechanic.
---
ie "Discover a card with Ranged" "Give your Mechs Ranged" or "Ranged Stealth Poisonous"
---
Much like how poisonous and lifesteal were expanded.

We already know Team-5 programmers are donkey. They don't understand computer science and  how to write actual production code what so ever.
---
Why not wait for the new cards, play out the new meta before you gimp yourself. Unless there's something you need, you shouldn't disenchant
---
Hmm, I disagree. I played a lot of Reno Mage in those days. And it was totally dumpstered by Had Druid, simply because it had an unlimited fatigue plan. The tempo notwithstanding.
---
So close to what?

I‚Äôve been playing wild this month and it‚Äôs much more enjoyable than I thought it would be. You should give it a try
---
You don't want to spend 3 mana on a shitty reactive card in Zoo. It's expensive, doesn't fit the gameplan, and the minion it kills is random. The best you get out of it is discarding it because it's bad.
---
Dark Pact is a lot better in Cube, the 2 mana difference is huge. You can go turn 5 Skull of the Manari -&gt; Cube a demon and Dark Pact the Cube turn 6. The effect isn't much better than Dark Pact and Dark Pact costs 2 less mana.
---
Why? I'm gonna assume you own most of them and you don't want them to be bad.
---
yeah, but like its just an rng slogfest, with the first 45min-hour being super easy into the last three where completely game bs which you lose the game based on your opening hand.

Yes or no.

I've played against this deck as odd paladin several times - and I can tell its really skill intensive. I have a 3-0 record against mechathun druid - and I think the secret to play against it is to pressure hard (to encourage him to end the game ASAP), and avoid killing the gadgetzans. I think too many players try to draw their entire deck in one to two turns, and then have trouble killing off their gadgetzan #2 or acolyte of pain. Since odd paladin plays small minions, it's difficult for druid to trade and kill their minions effectively. Often time, they will end up spending their naturalize on their one remaining minion and just play mechathun on the board, which then you can either stall with small minions and stop him from killing his own mechathun off, or you can leeroy and kill his mechathun while not triggering his deathrattle.
---
What tips do you have *against* this deck? Do you prefer if players kill your first gadgetzan? What about your second gadgetzan?
---
The secret plan is the boomsday project.
---
Aside from my main in WoW that was a male Gnome, I played exclusively female gnomes (when possible) and if not it was always female something else.  A lot of my gaming time people assumed I was female and I never corrected them. I just didn‚Äôt find that it mattered. In fact, it‚Äôs probably be better to be assumed male so you don‚Äôt get random creepy PM‚Äôs.

---
Of course yes but he tailored his collection around odd cost cards, this is just wrong, people disenchant class cards they don‚Äôt play and later regret it, this is so wrong, maybe the worst offender in selective disenchanting/crafting. I know dust is expensive, fuck this game. 
---
Aluneth (burn mage which is off meta) rexxar (midrange hunter) and  dk uther
---
I don't know exactly how the game looked but the fact that every comment here just says you should save scream is stupid. If there is 12 damage on board and you're at less than 20 hp you can't just do nothing and die to kill command since that is way more likely than the hunter having 2 back to back reloads.
---
Improvise. Overcome. Adapt.

2 mana secret: when you reach 7 mana crystals, automatically summon Dr Boom

Well as I stated they are among the most unique legendaries in the game (together with other build-around legends) but like 6/9 of them are bad.

And it is more intensive. When you have a complex enough vessel on the launchpad, your fps will tank to sub-30 regardless of your computer.

Tri-class cards are the reason I first got into Hearthstone. I was walking my dog through a park about a mile north of my house when I came across a neighborhood kid I'd never seen before. He was maybe six years old, flapping his arms like a bird in running in circles saying, "Crystals! Fresh from Kazakus!"
---
I thought he was pretending to be a magical bird or something, so I said "oh, are you a Phoenix like from Harry Potter?" The kid stopped moving and looked me dead in the eye and in the most serious tone you could imagine goes, "Tri-class cards are a new and exciting feature in the card game Hearthstone."
---
I talked to the kid for maybe an hour after that. He helped me understand that I needed to give tri class cards a try because of the unexpected possibilities they create. I talked to him about growing up, what it was like, what I struggle with the most.
---
I never saw him again after that day, but I kept the little purple crystal he gave me before I took off. I still think about that kid sometimes. I wonder what he thinks about the upcoming rotation and how he will feel not having tri class cards in standard. Honestly, I miss him so much and I just wish there was someway to know he was okay.
---
So, yeah, I think you make a great point OP. Your post hits on something deep that, you are right, people just aren't considering. Thanks for reminding us of that. This community needs men like you in the metas to come.
---
Mirror entity i guess? 
---
frozen clone into molten reflection? 
---
So no one will have a second sacrificial pact!
---
No they do. Rarity of a card is a function of its uniqueness and its complexity.
---
Primordial Drake was an epic card in part of how unique it was in Un'goro. It was the first minion with nearly on rate stats to be coupled with a battlecry that dealt AOE damage. As a result, Duskbreaker, which is basically a four mana version of Drake, was rare and Arcanosaur is common as it has been done before.
---
Twisting Nether is Epic, not because of what it does is particularly complex, but because it's the only board sweeper or AOE effect that just killed everything with no condition or damage amount within the classic set. The same sort of thing can be said about Brawl.
---
Dragonfire Potion was the first AOE damage spell that had an exception, Psychic Scream was the first board sweeper that shuffles minions into the deck, and Lightbomb was the first AOE and still only damage spell in which the damage it deals varies depending on the minion.
---

I started at rank 16 this month and decided to play a pretty standard even paladin.

Don‚Äôt see alot of players using this deck even though it‚Äôs alot of fun! 
---
Curvestone was at its worst with Shamanstone (#4mana77)

Odd paladin is a good one and OTK paladin is also good but costs more dust. OTK paladin is more consistant in my opinion but Odd paladin works well too. I‚Äôve used mainly Odd paladin and Secret hunter and have been able to get to 10. Good luck on the ladder! DM me if you want any of my decklists I will give them to you.

Most pro players really like the changes. 
---
There are a lot of upsides to the new system. 
---
It's a good thing. 
---
Looks like you need to give it a try lol
---
Nop, you have to make him draw using the naturalize or even you draw before Togwaggle to create more bloods and then give it to your oponent.
---
*it removes it from the board, I even stated he gets another N'zoth in his deck.  Surely you understood what I meant?
---
Are people arguing against the fact that psychic scream is bonkers? I'm done.  
---
That's barely 6 years ago, why shouldn't it?
---
The Bloods don't work that way. They get shuffled in after you had a regular draw (= after drawing an actual card or taking a fatigue damage. That's how 'casts when drawn' works). Usually you win by swapping a deck of Bloods and casting Naturalize in the same turn. 
---
Say you swap decks with 2 Bloods and nothing else in the deck and cast Naturalize. Your opponent draws 2 bloods, takes a fatigue damage, and then 4 bloods get shuffled in. Then the second draw from Naturalize happens, they draw 4 Bloods, take fatigue damage again, 8 Bloods are shuffled in. So they took 18 damage from Bloods + 2 fatigue ticks.
---
If that doesn't do it then you end your turn and your opponent draws 8 Bloods and takes fatigue damage again. So they took 42 from Bloods + 3 fatigue ticks.
---
&gt;It's astounding how far "quit being dumb" can get you in life.
---
Yeah? How would you know?
---
&gt; the thought of having to play other people and worrying if I will win or just lose every match I play hinders me greatly.  
---
Don't play it then? If you can't get past that level of anxiety thourgh medication or mental techniques for dealing with anxiety (or any other method for dealing with anxiety) it's not worth ruining your health further over a game like this.  
---
If you're anxious playing then you're not having fun and if you're not having fun then why bother palying?
---
&gt;for 4 years this game has been balanced with each of the 9 classes having an independent identity
---
Tell that to Druid.  Its identity was the "do everything" class, now it's the "do nothing" class.
---
Jaxx is almost always in at least a middle tier bucket when I see him. Mill house is bottom tier. 
---
In addition:
---
*Hearthstone is also a mobile game, so it is accessible to a larger audience, and playable anywhere you have a connection. 
---
*WoW is a subscription service to experience the content (after the initial free play period). Hearthstone's new content is freely available and built around an F2P model, pay when/if if you want, and have that content playable as long as hearthstone is in service.

I realise you gotta click the link
---
You can see the 2 screams on the history bar. 
---
And yes one of random spells killed one of his wolves.
---
Maybe I am an evil priest player (wizbang btw.), but I am not telling lies

Keyloh#1103 NA Trading 80g. You go first
---
Its wizbang sry
---
hmm man ur boring asf no entertaiment at all
---

Not a great take. A Fire Fly is great at turn 1, not so much turn 8.
---
It'd be cool in arena though you gotta admit it 
---
you were pretty lucky with the order. otherwise you would have faced 7 wolves
---
I agree with you OP, I think tri-class is one of the best mechanics for Hearthstone.
---
We effectively already have tri-class cards anyway.  Subject 9?  Pretty useless outside of Hunter, Pally, and Mage.  Hench-Clan Thug?  Pretty useless outside of weapon classes.  Calling those tri-class wouldn't change them, it would merely be a formality.
---
Tri-class allows team5 to develop more interesting "Neutral" cards, while disallowing them to be used by any class where they might be too abusive.
---
I'd also love to see tri-class spells.  Spells being limited to one class is a bit lame imo, as it heavily limits their play possibilities.
---
16 golden legendary duplicate ¬∞¬∞O
---
So you don't play it past turn 7 against priest unless you either can afford it, or desperately need it.
---
Subject 9 hunter and spell hunter have been around quite awhile and no one was complaining about them before Raka to the degree you see people complaining now. And I'm sure their winrates were worse because of druids.
---
Also, you can pick a few classes other than hunter and rewrite the sentence as "\_\_ deck are running \_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_"
---
It's mostly true that reddit and Twitch complains about the most dominant class every meta and proclaim it to be the WOAT meta.
---
I have been playing hunter a lot in the past year, before it became fotm, I don't think hunter's power level spiked heavily with raka. Rather that nerfs took away a counter to hunter.
---
I don't see any reason for a come back player not to be competitive in comparison to a new f2p player. It took me like a year as the 2nd type to comfortably sit at rank 5 every month as i was able to craft 2-3 meta decks by playing gazillions arena games. your dust collection is good for saving until the rotation and probably you can bank up a few thousand gold. I think by then it would be ok for some meta deck already. That is my assumption that you want at least rank 5. legend is a whole different level though. The key is to hold back yourself not to craft anything except Baku Gen Zilliax and essential classic legends like Leeroy, which probably you already have.
---
You would be surprised how often coining this out on 6 is still too slow. Psychic Scream is just Priest Vanish, when you get down to it. It removes the things on the board but it doesn't actually kill anything. What that means is that it's pure Tempo rather than Value like most AOE spells, and only running an actual win condition in your deck makes it a good card. Which Priest has right now, so Scream is a powerful card.
---
I think that, for much of Priest's history, Scream wouldn't have been played. An AOE that actually kills things is just better, even if it's less reliable. It doesn't "fuck your opponent's draws" reliably, only against specific decks that rely on a lot of tokens or on Voidlords.
---
So after looking into what you were saying, I realized that the first turn happened a turn ago from the original photo. What he did was Snapshot the Previous Psychic Scream from the History Bar, and then snapshot the most recent Psychic Scream on the history bar on the same turn.
---
Also the Spellstone Wolf took damage, and the other set of them didn't, so they aren't the same photo.
---
You don't always have the option to trade something off especially at typical gallery priests, and the times you do, it can be a massive tempo loss. "Running the wrong minions" isn't correct because the minions you want change so much throughout the game, you might've lost card draw cards, etc. 
---
Sorry to disappoint you mate, trying my best to improve, I'm still new you know üòÖ but thanks for advising me where should I improve
