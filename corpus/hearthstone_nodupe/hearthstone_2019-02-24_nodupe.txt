I think Even Paladin and Even Shaman could survive it as well. It just weakens then to fairer strengths. It also would allow Team 2 to print strong 2 drops again. Odd Mage of both styles would be fine as well.

This change really only kills Evenlock, Odd Pally, Odd Rogue, and Odd Hunter.

Oh dude I‚Äôm sorry for being so defensive. I got some dude in this thread arguing with me about how SSD doesn‚Äôt really matter for games, so I‚Äôve been kinda a dick here, cuz that‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous. 
---
If you‚Äôre using a SSD, fairly decent processor, and at least 8GB RAM... it should not be doing that. I would be frustrated about that if I were you, especially if you‚Äôve tried reinstalling and the nuclear option, reformatting. Hearthstone is not as simple of a game as people seem to think it is to run, but there‚Äôs no reason it should be doing that if your machine is halfway decent. That kinda stuff is so hard to diagnose and fix.

I'm glad he remembered that people initially praised these as "Reno done right."

The problem isn't that they're consistent (That's probably a very GOOD thing). People really have an issue with the particular benefit they give.

I really wish Blizz would put a greater emphasis on in-game decisions than deckbuilding ones.
---
Yeah don't listen to that guy.  There's a reason you were required to encrypt your drive, and props to that school for implementing it.  However, it killing your windows was obviously not suppose to happen, and they should be more than able to fix the issue (even though they clearly cannot).  
---
My advice is to make an appointment with the Dean of your program and tell them what your IT issues are.  It's another PITA step you have to unfortunately take but it will light a fire under IT's ass to get it fixed.  
---
It kills any deck that actually wants an early game. Which is most of them. "I can play behind curve for 5 turns" is *really* bad, especially since the mana discount is really important early on.
---
Good luck trying to build a board when your best play is two two drops in the first three turns.

Sorry, can someone explain?

What did it cost?

---
I can downvote you and not be mad. Most of us don‚Äôt get so infuriated on reddit that they can‚Äôt multi-task...
---
Yea, we just disagree. These two cards create such a boring, limited, repetitive dynamic in the game that it is not comparable to other deck types. 
---
I can understand your dislike for OTK decks, but this is much much worse. (I was fine when OTK was pretty much just Exodia mage, but it is getting out of hand right now, agree.) 
---
Yeah, all of those three are extremely similar. Norwegians are able to have conversations with Danish and Swedish people almost without any complications. Sometimes there is like one weird word we can‚Äôt understand, but the languages are basically just slightly different versions of each other.

Aggro is the only archetype I find interesting. Every decision matters a lot starting from turn 1. I have no idea how people can play control games that aren't decided until turn 25.
---
Hooray, more horribly-balanced cards!
---
They should really limit the amount of legendaries allowed per deck. The dust cost of most decks are fucking absured.  Force people to be more creative with cards that aren't legendary.
---
wall priest doesnt impact the design of evry future card adn evry future nerf/balance change, wall priest way be more problematic/stronger now but baku and genn are design for now and future they have to big of a impact litterly evry single card needs to be be around them desinged.
---
I tried to argue for Genn not being less of a problem than Baku. They ruin the same things about the game mainly design space and balance. Yes even decks are not as good after nerfs, but after rotation most of the Baku decks loses a bunch of cards and will probably be weaker as well. They will not nerf any of them, they've said they don't want to ruin the cards and as you've most likely seen here on reddit, all the possible nerfs are too impactful or not impactful enough.

You reply doesn't make much sense in this context.

Decks can have alternative wincons and switch from aggro to control. Just like it's a very real wincon for druids to just smorc people down with hero power and minions.

---
Did you really have to repost something you didn't make from circlejerk? I feel bad for you.
---
&gt; thats why upgraded hunter hero power wasent made to be 4/why warrior wasent made to be 3
---
Um... by your own logic you answered your question. Armor isn't health. Also, your logic is flawed because Warrior and Priest hero power are already the same. 
---
Armor can go beyond health. It is easily more valuable than health. So that's why 12 health for 4 isn't a big deal. It is really only worth it if you have taken 12 damage in the game. Otherwise that 4 mana will feel like a waste. But armor, you can benefit from that at any time. A 4 mana 12 armor card would be op. Hell, druid has been flamed until the end of time because they have a 4 mana 12 armor card. 
---
This is why lowering the armor to 3 actually makes the most sense. 2 mana 4 armor is really freaking op.
---
I love Wild, but I am generally opposed to almost all nerfs, including to Genn and Baku. I want one format to be like Vintage MTG where we can see what the best decks are using all cards from all time, with the fewest restrictions necessary to prevent things like consistent turn one kills. I love the idea of comparing the best decks of all time and watching decks evolve with the card pool.
---
I am probably in the minority here. I think most people want wild to be more like MTG Extended, where it‚Äôs a controlled and frequently changing meta just like Standard is, except with some more cards. But Standard will always be better for that, so I don‚Äôt really see the point.
---
One idea I saw someone mention in another thread is that every other hero power would be improved. This doesn't seem too bad as it allows Genn decks (the less problematic of these two) to still have a satisfying turn 1 option, but also adds a little room for strategy.
---
Your opponent summon 2 silver hand recruits via Baku? You can feel safe using AoE since he'll only be able to play 1 next turn. You want to use a 1 mana fireblast this turn? Next turn you'll have 7 mana and want to play your 6 mana minion, maybe you wait to see if the ping will be more useful next turn.
---
Both decks get nerfed, both still have similar early-game strategies, both can still make similar power plays, but it requires a more thought and time to get the same amount of value.
---
I support nerfing Baku and Genn just to put an end to Omnislash endlessly remaking the same Brian Kibler video every week.
---
And people are saying it shouldn't be. I think Baku should give it's own unique upgraded hero power, because it starts turn 1. Justicar's only starts after turn 6, and if you draw her.
---
That's the single most difference between the two cards. An upgraded hero power from turn 1 is sooo strong. It's the reason why in games when you didn't get justicar it felt so bad.
---
So if you are going to get the benefits of a 6 drop turn 1, clearly it needs to be balanced/tweaked because that is kinda op.
---
Your poll has too many options You have 4 options are in favor of the negativity, 2 against negativity, and one IDC option. While you did add context to some of those choices, they don't really merit the necessity of having that context. A better poll would look similar to the following.

Let's face it, once you're done reading the What's Working What Isn't and Ask competitive, there isn't much left to do on the competitive sub.
---
no effect, it's a card game.  In card games you buy packs to get cards to make a better deck, why is that so hard for some people to understand that? 
---
Make them 0 mana 0/1's with the battle cry, upgrade your hero power. Make genn also have (you will always draw this on turn 4) exception and baku have (You will always draw this on turn 5) exception.
---
And then! Just delete the cards!
---
[removed]
---
Even before those days. Warrior was all the greedy control legendaries to the point is was only legendaries. Ysera, rag, baron, Sylvanas. I remember i could never play it but then i spent money and felt like a god.
---
The way I would prefer it is to have them HOF'd to a new "Wilder" format, where you can play with all of the cards before their nerfs.
---
Two of those are awful decks that shouldn't have existed.
---
I don't like the fact that it has totally warped their nerf decisions. Cards that would usually get a 1 mana increase are getting at least two if not more to prevent them from just being used in even instead of odd or vice versa. 
---
&gt; I guaran-fucking-tee you there is a weekly meeting
---
LOL Weekly, try Daily.
---
I get them like twice a day. I have no idea why. 
---
The thing about genn is; rather than promoting an aggressive playstyle like some baku hero powers do; genn promotes a tempo-based playstyle that's not inherently aggressive. Essentially it gives you 1 mana for free during 5 turns during the game. Don't get me wrong, that's really strong, but it's not nearly as oppressive. So yeah, I also feel like baku is the problem to primarily focus on. But I wouldn't be against an elegant nerf if they come up with one for genn.
---
ok?

---
Kingsbane, aggo pally, mech hunter, aggro token druid, pirate warrior, there are many viable aggro decks.  In fact Even Shaman is one of the greatest anti-aggro decks, suppressing aggro that could exist.
---
Shaman is its own problem, since other than Even Shaman no shaman deck sees play, and that's a problem.  Odd Warrior is personally not the form of control warrior that I want to play against for eternity.
---
"why is hs getting less popular?" is the point of this topic.

Stuff that was the same back when hearthstone was not getting less popular can hardly be the reason for it, can it?

---
The complaints were much more louder back then. 
---
Baku and Genn are badly designed in two ways:  1) they're too powerful, 2) they foster repetitive gameplay.
---
Your idea makes them extremely weak, eliminating reason 1).  However, it replaces that reason with a different one, which is that the cards don't make internal sense.  Upgrading the hero power in a deck stuffed with 2-drops isn't appealing.  Making the hero power cheaper in a deck stuffed with 1-drops isn't appealing.  Currently, the cards feel good to play, if boring, because you plan your game around your consistent curve, and it pays off nearly every game.
---
As an example, I'm currently playing Even Rogue.  This deck utilizes the fact that you're guaranteed a weapon on turn 1 to use 2-drops that depend on having a weapon in play, like Bloodsail Raider and Sharkfin Fan and Toxicologist.  Without a guaranteed weapon on 2, my deck no longer makes any sense at all.
---

---
To each his own, but isn't it as exciting as watching paint dry?
---
I posted about it a couple days ago but the game was me as control mage and my opponent as quest control priest with the seance and benedictus plan. I managed to get my opponent to lethal range a couple times but my opponent copied my deck and got my Zola so he stabilized everytime. Most of the game I spent pressuring with water elementals from Jaina and cards from sindragosa while my opponent would just clear and heal. It felt like I had no chance but I kept playing to see what would happen. Eventually I got my opponent to 12 health and he cleared my board but chose not to use Amara or play any minions. Earlier in the game I had gotten brann off toki and, with 2 cards in my deck, I won the 50/50 to top deck janalai for lethal.
---

Honest question, have you played Genn decks?  You can test this nerf out for yourself, by refusing to hero power until turn 4.  My guess is you will not have good results.

I‚Äôd say that it‚Äôll make Genn decks weaker in the early game and stronger in the late game. I mean, in the late game, Genn makes no difference... even decks always end up floating mana if they use their hero power. I think you‚Äôll see Genn control decks that are rather strong if you give Genn the upgraded hero power (assuming you get some control tools that are even). 
---
Lol, the 1600 or 3200 dust is nothing compared to how much more it takes to craft odd/even decks.

uhmm, i might be wrong here, but that‚Äôs wrong. they create an obscene amount of value in the *early* game. 
---
hero powers get worse as the game goes on, whether that‚Äôs deal 2, armor 4, 2 1/1s, a 2/2 weapon. they get worse. they‚Äôre great in the early game (and are crazy value) because they answer your opponents cards with ZERO cards. that‚Äôs value. 
---
Feel free to guess. I can give you a tip: my all time record is 99 quests in a single month.
---
No.
---
imo the heart of those card is the upgrading/discounting the hero power at turn one,so i think we can get rid of the restriction and make it bad on other aspect
---
I dunno the solution, but Genn and Baku were the straw that finally broke the camel's back. Baku is not an interesting card to play against.

I always outvalue them with my Big spell mage, otherwise every OTK. Hunters can also outvalue him with early Rexxar.
---
Well, I'm saying whatever you roll from animal companion will win you the game, so that's a guaranteed win as well. It's not a single solution puzzle.
---
It would beyond suck.
---
Think drawing Patches the Pirate except if you draw him before playing him, you outright lose instead of just being at a massive disadvantage.
---
Because China's laws shouldn't apply to us.
---
So if you are looking for more here is a tip my friend told me about and it seems to work for me. Always have you location set to high accuracy and set it through your app permissions. I get them a lot about places I have been. Also they test to see if you lie. Once they catch you you will almost never get them.
---
What is the point of this?  You're supposed to (ab)use the cheap/upgraded hero power for early value/tempo/armor, that's the entire point of the card.  Genn's effect is NOT worth waiting several turns for.  Baku's definitely not worth waiting 8 entire turns for.  That just gives you a dead card in your hand that doesn't even do shit when you do end up playing it.  That's like keeping Mind Control in your hand every single game, except instead of being useful on turn 10, it's kind of shitty one turn earlier.  
---
The only reason this suggestion is reasonable is that it would totally destroy the cards, which therefor means it's a change Blizzard could actually implement
---
Everyone‚Äôs said it, but as someone who plays a lot of odd warrior here‚Äôs my two cents. 
---
OTKs are a big threat because odd warrior needs a perfect hand and draw to out tempo them. Oddball decks like tesspionage rogue and some quest priests (especially if they resurrect a lot).  So decks that are even slower than odd warrior.
---
And finally, deathrattle rogue and hunter can be a bit of a toss up. Warrior needs to remove the egg before it gets triggered, but then they need removal after that. It‚Äôs a bit of a balancing act because of the egg isn‚Äôt removed you get out valued. But If you remove the egg without adequate removal in hand you can easily get out tempoed. Of course, you might just steam roll them too. 
---
A little late here, you could even have the players gain 2 crystals a turn. That's what I wish Tavern brawl did more of. Instead of just different cards and scenarios try different core game mechanics.
---
1/2 windfury, maybe?
---
So you think that blizzard is incompetent to correctly buff a card? Ofcourse nerf to spellstone can be justified, but where is alternative? This 200 dust change afftcted 3000 dust package to play Spell Hunter. (weapon, 2xepic, zul'jhin) For example would change in Baited Arrow damege from 3 to 4 break the game? (most of 3 mana drop now days have 4hp and 4 drops are rarly played and most have divine shield or +4hp) This would created good 5 mana drop. &lt;= Would truly balance the deck to 50% winrate where it should be. Nerf are too negative, too depressing :D I don't wonna play a game that is depressing :D Make meh happy
---
We have single cards capable of full clearing at 5, 6, and even sometimes 2 mana. Equality is fine in Wild. 
---
You are now informed sir. This happened to me and it was a loss 
---
HS's entire playerbase probably covers the whole spectrum on this issue. For cards like Genn/Baku, I would personally be VERY frustrated if their consistency were similar to Reno's where in some games I simply wouldn't get the hero power my deck was designed for (ex: Odd Paladin). I understand there are players who really like HS's many zany effects.
---
I'll agree to disagree on this one.
---
I know, it's a big problem. I'm not denying the problem. 
---
Well, a 50% chance to be exact...

Arena WAS Wild for most of Hearthstone's history, even before Wild and Standard existed. 
---
Blizzard created Standard Arena because players (many here on Reddit) complained that the card pool was too diluted with cards from all of HS time and new cards never showed up.
---
Wild arena can be a breath of fresh air for a time, but I imagine that, with time, those same complaints would surface again.
---
its not creative or viable. A better combo would be to ancestors call al akir then spellstone it in wild. Except you're kind of better off using malygos instead
---
There is nothing wrong with either Genn or Baku in general. What's wrong is Genn and Baku in Paladin, so that should be fixed instead. 
---
That's his win rate as Paladin vs Paladin.

I liked 1 mana Rock Biter because it allowed me to play a combo Leeroy deck.
---
I can't play that combo anymore. Should Blizzard revert the change just because I liked it.
---
It doesn't work that way. 
---
Just remove the taunt.
---
And give it one attack.
---
And turn the frog into a sheep.
---
Easy peasy.
---
Nice whiteknighting lol. Also, you're a hypocrite for telling others not to be a dick to her while you yourself are acting like a dick to her with this post.
---
Regarding the post, you're linking to a youtube channel from six years ago that she very likely has forgotten about. Even if she does know, who cares? 
---
I bet you're just hungry for some drama.
---
 
---
True. I finished it with alarm o bot and the biggest minions.
---
After Blizzard had fired so many people, they had so little workers they are now classified as "Indie Company".
---
I'm just baffled. If I see someone spit out what I believe to be conspiracy nonsense my reaction is to ignore them or I express genuine concern for them because it's sad to be trapped in that way of thinking and I hope I can show them that the chemtrails theory is actually nonsense.
---
You seem to think that's what I'm in and your response is to be a dick to me. Lmao. Cool dude.
---
Also while you're using the definition of controversial which is "debatable" it's common if not almost universally used to mean creates public outrage. Literally means "turn against" in Latin. So yes if someone is accused of being a pedophile they are controversial immediately.
---
And dude you might happily be ignoring everything around you because you're above it all so good on you. You somehow have time to argue with someone whose concerns and who is themself beneath you, however.
---
I don't get how your lol dont care attitude is something you can actually hold onto while typing anything in response to me. If you actually didn't give a fuck you wouldn't say anything. But here you are pushing against the cultural change I'm helping to inflict on something you involve yourself in because you're happy to ignore other people doing it without telling you while you minimize their influence.
---
When there are too many sets in arena it just becomes boring. You cant get any decent synergies and you can't play around any cards. My idea for arena is: at the start of the draft they should add a pick of an extra expansion from wild, cards from which will appear during the draft. Or maybe just one extra random wild expansion every season.
---
I get these when I don't play much as a reminder to play the game. I never get these. Mails when. I play a good amount of games during the season 
---
There are some tools out there, that let you save any number of decks. you also could simply put your deckcodes in a table. I hardly believe, you are playing more than 18 decks every week.
---
[https://youtu.be/qtk\_-YpxLt0?t=51](https://youtu.be/qtk_-YpxLt0?t=51)
---
Wild arena with just all cards included just means that the card pool is far too diluted, and you would never play around any card anymore. It would take all the skill out of playing arena.
---
"Wild" arena with a manually curated card pool would be awesome, but would require human labour in Blizzard's end, and arena probably isn't worth enough to them.
---
This makes Genn useless. I‚Äôm not sure you even know why the card is good. 
---
Oh, this crap again?
---
Amazing he himself isn't tired of talking about it by now.
---
Wait what they actually are? 
---
/r/customhea - oh wait
---
Considering Liam has *literally* given me two Liam's once in the same deck, pulled turn 6 and 7, I'm probably not going to do well, but thanks for the vote of confidence!!
---
I can point mistakes IMO yes, but I don't know his hand once the cards got replaced, all would be assumptions. I'm assuming you don't play this match, so you don't know how important is to mess with priest res pol + avoid having 3 1/1 cards send to my deck for a scream, what was the reason he used one res with zilliax having both velen and maly in hand. I played assembly on 5, not 6, before dynomatic "shit" play. The shield slam, I can give you that, maybe I could used before. Anyway, I'm done discussing with someone that thinks adding minions to priest's res pol is a shit play.
---
whats so wierd about it, its the way cubel... OH MY ITS TURN 6
---
Some of the rez priest have been using topsy turvy combo. geist might not be enough, they just need to rez multiple high health minion.
---
Best way is just to use geist and try to dilute their rez pool with cards like polymorph,hex,tinkmaster,the ungoro taunt summon 3 raptor, stuff like that.
---
Oh, I know it's a thing. That's a whole other level of broken that really proves how braindead Blizzard are. 
---
(EU) BroKenUniTy#2463 80 gold quest trade, you go first, Ill edit this once Im done.
---
no... just no, the whole idea of making your hero power cost 1 or upgrading it is to provide benefits. Sacrificing all odd or even cards to get benefits on your the same turn that you would want to play a card for example playing a 2 drop on turn 2. If you had a 1 cost hero power on turn 2 it just kills the cards. Genn is not a problem atm and baku is problematic in paladin which is losing all of its cards after the expansion.
---
Sure nice nerf but way 2 bad to see play
---
Weird flex bro. 
---
The deck scores were insane too by the end of wild arena. I think the way it is now is way better them wild arena. 
---
I'd go as far as to say Zoo and Odd Pally aren't that "aggro" either. Deathrattle Hunter is also mid-range. Honestly, OP couldn't be further off from the truth in his assessment that mid-range was in a poor place.
---
You might say this version Genn is broken with Death Knights because it doesn't say "starting hero power" but they're rotating out so it enables a neat combo in Wild for players to experience. I believe Blizzard **must** make decisions like these for their game to gain attention or else it will decay. This is a great year to do so, and start making out-of-the-box decisions like increasing quest rewards or other methods of getting players back at the game.
---
I trully respect Blizzard's vision as if has been my favourite game company for many years now, but never understood why they "hold back" on giving stuff or pushing the edges of card design where you can see these days how a free-to-play surprise game that came out of nowhere took over the Royale genre in a week. They're afraid of breaking the game by exploring wild wicked effects and that fear took them down.
---
I love this game, hope they bring Hearthstone as fun as it was back in KotfT or KnC where they actually went a little "crazy" on card design.
---
Peace ‚ô•

don't ask so much for a small indie company plz. if the technology existed, they would've done it aeons ago!

Reddit doesn't work that way lol, if you comment, the post won't go to the top.
---
The only way is if more people get interested and upvoted the post bumping it up, other than that is deleting and reposting but i think that will be against the sub rule ,since it fall under spamming.
---
Anyway why not develop something to notify the users whenever there is a new update in the app itself? That way you don't have to make new post and when user see the notification in their app, the can choose to update it.
---
This is definitely an interesting and significant nerf, but I think overall these would be pretty unplayable. The idea behind even decks is to hero power to fill up the extra mana that you have on odd turns since all your cards are even. And not being able to HP on turn 2 would be a detriment to all odd decks which are mostly aggro.
---
&gt; They‚Äôve already made balance changes for Wild in the past, so it‚Äôs a moot point. Things that end up with too high a winrate or too much negative feedback do tend to get nerfed. Naga Sea Witch got a well deserved nerf after tons of player complaints
---
Incredibly disingenuous example since surely you know that the Naga Sea Witch + Giants interaction was a result of Blizzard changing the way the engine calculated discounts. That's not how the original card worked or was ever intended to work.
---
Again you must know Shadowboxer was changed because of unintended interactions created after the card was printed.
---
I don't see how with a straight face can argue that preventing cards from breaking due to engine changes is the same as balancing something due to being "unfun". 
---
I still don‚Äôt understand why they brought one of the all time most RNG based cards back into the game. 
---
What? There are 18 allowed decks? I can only see 9. How do I access the other 9 slots?

I wouldn't be oppossed to having it around for like a month or two as an event, just not have arena be wild only permanently
---
Lol
---
"the code" is that you have to play as and against all shrines a lot to know your strengths and their weaknesses. You don't get the cards you want all the time, or even the shrines, but that's part of the challenge. 
---
All the while Blizzard is treating homosexuality as a tool...
---
Nope, hadn't heard that was a thing - good to know, Thanks!
---
A deck technically being able to win another way is not the same as a deck having multiple win conditions. Maly Druid has multiple win conditions. It has a fair bit of reach, an outlasting game plan and the DK. Mecha'thun lock is hardly similar as it only has cycle and survivability. That deck is built to do just one thing.
---
Cloning Priest is a bad example. There exist a four minion version which is pure OTK, but the most common one is deliberately built to have multiple wincons. A pure OTK deck wouldn't run LK or Lyra. The value plan is one of the main win conditions, just like in Maly Druid.
---
I'm not going in depth on your matchup points, as I don't agree with how you play them. You definitely need to play for a resistant board against Maly or you die to buffed Swipe (multiple win cons, remember?). Just apply enough pressure to force out resources. This is similar to how you face Cloning Priest. Against Cube, it really depends on how the match plays out. I have to say, I don't find myself going for value very often.
---
There is definitely difference between how you play against Topsy or Mecha'thun and how you face Cloning Priest or Maly Druid.
---
Not only is no one interested in another Baku Nerf idea post. Yours actually makes the card stronger. Why?

I know the best would be if they removed them but that's not gonna happen 
---
No
---
He suggested to simply play the whole hand. Your calculation makes no sense in that context.
---
üñï
---
Totally agree. I think an incorporation of where we put our minions is a great point of what we are all saying. We want play decisions not deck decisions. You even see it in discarding now (I‚Äôve never wanted something to work as badly as I want discard warlock to work) with the ability to ‚Äúdecide‚Äù what you discard (reckless diretroll and shriek) 
---
Yeah, I find I run into them when my casual mmr drops really low, like when I'm trying to make a super bad homebrew work.
---
nearly 4 years: 49 shaman... the rest is 60, but there just haven't been any shaman decks that were interesting to me
---
at least someone roar on that case,most likely you
---
Yes. Let's let Even Warlock always have a Mountain Giant in their opening hand.
---
What should we talk about if not for gameplay?
---
You made the right decision.
---
Is there precedent for Hall of Faming an expac card, versus just waiting for automatic ‚ÄúHoF‚Äù via rotation?
---
For the swarm
---
Somebody with a higher APM can fit more actions into a set amount of time (in Hearthstone's case, they can click their mouse faster and make more sequential decisions) than somebody with a slower APM. APM priest is named as such because its combo requires so many sequential actions to be played within a single turn that you're often fighting the turn timer to get your combo off, and therefor you need a high APM in order to pilot the deck well.
---
Good God. I thought you stopped.
---
It does mean actions per minute, and it describe how many physical inputs you are putting into a game. In Hearthstone that basically just refers to playing and managing your cards. APM Priest is an OTK deck that requires an enormous amount of actions to actually kill someone in a single turn. It takes so many actions and is so complicated (unless you study it a bit or have a flow chart etc) that its low winrate is actually a reflection of how physically demanding it is (most people can't do it) rather than how effective the deck is.
---
What part of "free things are arbitrarily efficient" is hard for you?  I honestly don't see how you don't understand this.  Do you just not understand the word "value"?  What's your hangup, here?
---
Kripp the Salt Elemental
---
That wood be as crazy as taking all your Magic cards in your suitcase when you fly overseas. That's impossible.
---
No there isn‚Äôt yet. But it is a viable option according to some people.
---
I only got one once
---
Oh sure they‚Äôre efficient, they provide good tempo, but that is completely different from infinite value.
---
I can see how that might be confusing but what about just having more deck slots? Are they worried that new players will expect themselves to have X decks? I‚Äôd say 18 is already a super high expectation as I barely hit 4 or so right now. Not sure I see what the problem with infinite or near infinite decks is. Just add a page when one overflows right?
---
Been playing the deck for ages and it is not even close to hard to complete the combo if your opponent has no taunts. I actually prefer to combo on Mobile as it is much easier
---
Primarily 3-drops in arena is not incorrect, especially as hunter, as long as they are well statted.
---
Once you get to rank 25, you can craft whizbang the wonderful. It's the only card required in the deck. If you use the new whizbang deck, then you start the game with a random deck out of a pool of 18.
---
I joined the game for specifically that reason. If you have small amounts of storage on your phone you learn to find 1-2 great games 
---
What's wrong with warrior? Especially after the quest rotates?
---
Cloudless#1979 add me, show and I show, then we'll do it :)
---
Imagine how absurd a baku deck would be if it could mulligan for prince keleseth. There really isn‚Äôt a good way to nerf these cards without changing the hero powers
---
I'm gonna do it...
---
They are stream sniping him.
---
2 cards moved to HoF
---
No other changes
---
Pre-order the new xpac for $60 and get a hero portrait! 
---
OP suggested that warrior was an issue with odd decks so it's just a response to that
---
This is why Blizzard should make it like chess, where you have a set amount of time, which each turn you use the time, but excess time gets added to the total. That way people who rope every turn would lose, but those who only do it a few times, could still do so, and win the game.
---
I‚Äôm curious, what class do you usually run? Also, when making your deck, I think you should look at curve/having a decent amount of low-mid cost minions
---
Give them better stats and then activate it on play, not starting in deck. Reno/justicar style. Fixed. 
---
Contrats!
---
Same have a 2070 card don‚Äôt know why it lags 
---
Yea changing the graphics in the game doesn‚Äôt do anything either
---
The real problem I have with discard is its natural variance. It's the kind of variance that's unhealthy for competitive settings.
---
So sometimes you discard the perfect card early and can't be beat. Another time you discard the wrong one and can't win. I strongly dislike mechanics like that. As a competitive player, I never want to see such mechanics become competitive.
---
If Blizz could make the mechanic less swingy, I'd be more ok with it, but I strongly believe HS needs to move away from very high-variance mechanics.
---
This guy gets it
---
WOTC doesn‚Äôt want vintage to exist.  It‚Äôs only a format to excuse people playing with Power 9 cards that are iconic to MTG.  It exists for collectors not tournament players and it‚Äôs not supposed to be balanced.

Enough of these insanely powerful random effects. *Sometime you get an OK card that doesn't really help much in your situation. Sometimes you win the game on the spot*
---
Omg Regis Senpai Noticed me! 
---
I just assumed you were hosting the announcement! Sorry for that üòÖ
---
Uses spells to do face damage rather than minions on board. See also: "burn mage".
---
A game icon is something that should always be instantly recognizable. You don't want to change something this important too often.
---
Ahh so like the aggro mage we have now or alternatively the older one with pyroblast and fireballs for finishers
---
I think I just stumbled upon the solution.
---
Make Genn/Baku start the game on the board as minions with 0 attack. Kind of like totems in a sense, *and they may not attack*. Their ability is an aura effect on the player. Amount of HP on Genn/Baku to be determined(probably in the 6-10 health range).
---
When they die/are silenced, the player loses the upgraded hero power and goes back to the regular one.
---
This promotes interesting dynamics where the player is incentivized to customize their decks in order to protect Genn/Baku if they want the effect long-term, or in the case of an aggro deck, don't even bother. This could mean investing in minions that heal.
---
Notable tech options and minions that are dangerous to Genn/Baku are Crazed Alchemist, Ironbeak Owl, Spellbreaker and spells such as Topsy Turvy, and of course Mind Breaker as an alternative.
---
&gt; "I like the card" is not a sufficient enough of an excuse.
---
Of course it is, people play games for enjoyment and if that enjoyment gets ruined they may very well go elsewhere.  
---
People forget this is a game which is why ranked is the worst part of it as it really removes a lot of enjoyment from the game as people play the drudgery of ladder grinding.  
---
You just summed up Hearthstone.
---
You're an idiot.
---
Risking collateral damage with sympathy. That‚Äôs a bold move, Cotton
---
The Deathwing is going to destroy this post if you don't flair it quickly!
---
And whatever gets announced will be canceled by September...
---
I think I ever received 2-3 surveys about youtube in my life and never about google.
---
I also made a suggestion, that both of the minions effects are inactive in hand. Really bad in early game, and also in Bakus case means playing a bad minion, but the good effect is worth it, I think
---
So hunters mark went from played to still played, and spellstone went from played to still played. Hence my premise.
---
You probably don't care, but I was looking forward to the wild brawliseum and the wild arena. More dust and gold during the lunar festival was great, but it's "content-less", I want to do different things than regular ladder and arena (ah the free rastakhan pack just replace the regular brawl, big deal..)
---
But I do appreciate the daily master qualifier stuff, it's a new thing to try out. Although that seems a bid demanding, I just want to play a couple of matches, and on my pace, not a whole 7 round swiss tournament..
---
Both still played but both easier to play against
---
Of course the cards arent as strong after the nerf.  Perhaps you need to read my title again, they didnt work. Hunter is still oppressive and meta defining.
---
What decks exactly are you using? I have no trouble using decks like control warlock against hunters
---

80g quest trade  Travincal#1724
---
There should be a card that reverts hero powers to what they were at the start of the game, before Baku and Genn. This will also stop death knights. 
---
Elder Bronze dragon
---
6 Mana 4/6
---
Battlecry: revert all hero powers to their original state
---
The yearly card rotation...
---
The older three sets lose their Standard legality to make room for this years set of three.
---
Watching me playing indie games is about the same as streaming I guess
---
Their impact in the game has not changed, and the core of the deck has not been addressed. Not only does the 'play around it' argument not work, it has been old and outplayed since before the nerfs. "Just play around 5 mana spreading plague" "just play around the nourish on 5" "just play around UI" "Just play around"....still not fun. It's not keeping players and its certainty not earning any.
---
Added. Im AryA#22662
---
I just found out that rewards give legendary minions too :/
---
I rotate around 10 standard decks, my issue is not the win rate. The problem is how many hunters are STILL warping the meta in ranks mostly under legend
---
Definitely love Justicar but was a problem when control warriors existed. In the mirror it was literally who could draw justicar first.
---
It‚Äôs the shadow card from Valeera
---
&gt;Odd Warrior is probably the only other true "problem" odd/even deck at the moment IMHO mainly due to its polarization and as much as I actually enjoy playing it I think it could do with a nerf come rotation as it is losing nothing except Stonehill and Flurry.
---
Flurry is absolutely HUGE to lose for Odd Warrior.  I'm not even sure the deck will be good without it.
---
I'm totally with you though.  They should just nerf the Paladin/Warrior/Rogue hero powers and leave Baku and Genn as is.  Lesser-played Odd and Even decks are fun and interesting, and I honestly think Genn is pretty balanced (Plus, everything good about Even Warlock is going to rotate out next set anyway).
---
The strength not in the deck, the strength in you. 
---
Good job.  
---
one day may it rise to the top!
---
always in opening
---
Heartharena isn't cheating, it ranks the cards relative to their power level and synergy with your current deck.  Top streamers use it because it's helpful to see possible synergies they might have missed.  9.5/10 times Kripp (best arena steamer) will pick the best card that heartharena would also pick- he's proven this with "blind drafts" with HA off.  It's a tool that can help, but absolutely won't win you games by itself; you still have to know how to play, bait out and test for possible answers, and react appropriately/conserve your own answers when possible.
---
Reminds me of this one Hunter player I saw once, his deck was *literally* nothing except 1 mana minions and he **NEVER** targeted minions, he only attacked face (and used hero power). He got me to 4 health eventually as well, was about to be salty for losing to a drone who just goes face endlessly without trading when it would be beneficial, but I skillfully topdecked a Healing Rain so I managed to win.
