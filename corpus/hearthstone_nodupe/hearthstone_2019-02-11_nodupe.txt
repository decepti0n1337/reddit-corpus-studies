Yeah Shaman's requires planning and even deckhuilding to fully make use of its effect.
---
You can just slap Deathstalker into literally any non-hero power based deck and its practically the best possible card. Infinite value that adapts to the situation... on top of an anti-board and armor battlecry.

It's not a bad sentiment but at current people are really annoyed at the gutting of the Classic set, so it's an impolitic time to suggest nerfing or rotating more of them.

Fun and interactive, what i sure love about those decks...
---
No one would run a 6 mana consecration that doesn‚Äôt even give reach. Not even [[powershot]] saw a whole lot of play.
---
The fact that an auto include for hunter also has a board clear attached to it is problematic because Hunter otherwise *would not run board clears*.

3/-/- | Deal 2 damage to a minion and the minions next to it.

And it casts consecration... 
---
I mean it only took 14h for someone to finally point it out. So there's that. 
---
Just play evenlock. It's handlocc, but better.
---
its about ethics in boob journalism
---
Did you coin into Book of Specters? What time do you normally play arena at?
---
Buffed Saronites were nerfed. It was an incredibly big change. 
---
Fortunately it is a card which will get weaker come every expansion as the beast pool gets bigger and bugger. I feel they're holding off a nerf until Rexxar can rotate into wild
---
roses are red violets are blue
---
It's consecration, plus iron hide... Which is 5 mana and 2 cards. Plus it gives you the best hero power (read: best effect) in the game.
---
The rest of your deck is largely irrelevant afterwards. 
---
Idk maybe sincere?
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs to blame. I think that it was originally planned that way, then they either decided it was too much to localize and cut it, or they pretended to cut it to and bring it back to play the hero. 
---
There‚Äôs no innate reason why vicious scalehide‚Äôs body and text had to be on a beast, same with stone skin basilisk and cave hydra. They chose to make these interesting beasts that patched hunter problems like healing and aoe, knowing they‚Äôd be in the pool. It‚Äôs not like they magically decided to make beats minions with relevant text right after the zombeast hero and didn‚Äôt realize people would put two and two together. 
---
If only blizzard said that they won't add new beasts for balance reasons, instead of blurting out that it's too hard to code in different languages.
---
TIL I was the villain I've complained about all along.
---
Had no clue it affected the handbuff aspect, unless this guy is running keleseth though then I don't see how rogue's usage of saronite was nerfed 
---
Oof
---
Lots of slow control decks run doomsayers because they're such great anti aggro tools. Either you drop 7 damage into them (instead of your face) or you reset the board and gives you the tempo to play something else.
---
This deck is incredibly easy to play if you know the other decks so you can play your removal appropriately. Literally just play taunts on curve usually unless you can board clear a big board. More often than naught the enemy cant deal with an ogre never mind a turn 9 tutor of ogre and grizzly. If they leave it up you can just mass dispel their taunts and kill them 
---
My favorite is when I put out Frozen Clone and Mirror Entity on turn 8, and they Lich King into it.
---
Hi, Galileo sends his regards to you. 
---
To be honest I‚Äôve been an avid hunter player before it became ‚Äúhot‚Äù to play hunter. I always complained about not having a decent board clear and ways to deal with control or a big board. DK Rexxar was an insta craft for me and was the best decision ever. Played it all the way from release of KotFT till I got 500 wins. Adding Zul‚ÄôJin to the mix just made hunter even crazier and fun to play. So don‚Äôt complain. Us hunter have been in the shit for too Long. Be happy it‚Äôs rotating out and move on.  
---
More like one step behind 
---
If you could repackage this deck for a  low budget player, how would you do so?
---
Is there a way to strengthen this deck against combo? 
---
Crowd roaster is a surprise. Out of all the rastakan epics, that one making the top ten is surprising.
---
But you described the game right? You don't kill a late game deck before lategame, it gets to do powerful late game things. 
---
I'm sure quest priests are over talking about aggro decks like,
---
I disagree. If you happen to draw badly, and can't kill ~~them~~ *their minions* before ~~the reward~~ *establish a board*, ~~you've just wasted a ton of resources, and then they heal, and probably get another copy with [[Seance]] and [[Gorgonzola]]~~ *you just die to kill command or cold blood.*

Yeah lol
---
Book of specters is an incredibly well designed card imo. A card that pushes archetypes in an incredibly powerful way, that is difficult and interesting to build around, that is barred from already existing decks abusing it to the point where it's way too busted.
---
Yes, but my point was that in an actual game it isn‚Äôt. 
---
Here's the original pencil sketch: https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/a0wdn4/jaina_proudmoore_portrait_pencil

---
I‚Äôve pulled this off once in about 30 games with this deck 
---
Forgot that card existed lol
---
There is sometimes a possibility of the obscure zombeast combination that messes up a combo deck
---
Ok, but we're talking about his versatility. We're saying because of the value he can give, you don't need to worry about whatever else is in your deck.
---
I can't blame blizzard if they never wanted to touch the pool of beasts as a balance lever, because the only reason that's a thing is because parts of the community *cough* this subreddit *cough* exploded when they found out that it wasn't expanding with each expansion. 
---
I think the balance option here is simple and follows blizzards nerfing mantra, make Rexxar cost 7 or 8, if they wanted what I think would be slightly better, make it 8 and up the aoe damage to 3. 
---
Right, got it. Thank you. Yeah, quests could‚Äôve used some more work for sure.
---
I mean playing against priest getting a board presence and tempo is obviously what the card was telling you is the best move. I see no problem with this. /s
---
Nice.
---
0,06% chance of happening btw
---
Personally I'd like an alternate Jaina portrait with her BFA look.
---
Evenlock?
---
Mind sharing a list?
---
Honestly, I think well over half of Rexxar's rise in power level was due to the nerfs that took place around him.
---
During the period of time where he "wasn't good", Jade Druids were playing bigger and bigger men, Priests were Raza/Anduining, and Patches charging out of every deck disincentivized people from playing the 2/1s and 3/2s that Rexxar punishes.

Mages wear armor. Its just clothing.

Doesn't asking for a deck kinda defeat the purpose of if being funny?
---
Goddammit I love Zilliax.
---
Whats stopping, for example, a rogue from killing all your minions? If all your taunts are dead, they cant protect your face.
---
I really like the spellstones, despite a few of them being pretty weak and a few being archtype-enabling all on their own.
---
The most fun deck for me is Espionage Rogue, although not that good to climb with, but can get pretty crazy sometimes.

Def aiming for 5 this season. New ranking system made it so much better of an experience imo. 
---
I hope that your dragon‚Äôs fury didnt roll Glyph too many times.
---
First of all Congrats! Why would you play this over the cube version without undatakah?
---
Yeah I managed to hold on for a few more turns but that was a huge swing turn for my opponent. I spent too many minions trading into the taunt that I completely lost board control. And playing a ‚Äúzoo‚Äù deck, it eventually cost me the game.
---
You admitted it man, its pretty inconsiderate to waste others people time who just want to play a game when you rope every turn because your cooking. Maybe you should get over yourself.
---
So... make a confusing and arbitrary rule that does almost nothing except hurt new players?
---
Okay........
---
In both decks the armor gain is stupidly high, thats true
---
I'm color blind. 
---
So glad you corrected me it was an injustice to say 50 packs what was I thinking.
---
&gt;  This will still get them called SJWs 
---
But social justice types are body-positive and wouldn't want them covering her up...?
---
The card is broken
---
Actually, it has nothing to do with Magic. I just like the idea of a tri-class card. 
---
I barely hit 15 rank and I did all the runs in either half or a quarter of the wins. Either you need to stick to a strategy to win or you had some bad luck. 
---
you can go without Zilliax?
---
Its Maa'am. 
---
Ma'am Horror. 
---
Hunter and priest for climbing in standard and then majordomo warlock and lockdown shaman for fun in wild. 
---
Tempo rogue, mechathun loc and druid, midrange hunter. Pretty sure i could do cubelock as well but priests are not that common at rank 11-10. Am pretty casual as well
---
You should add 2
---
Your claim does not invalidate mine, therefore it's useless to press on it. As you well know.
---
"Look at me, I'm commenting on someone using complicated words because I'm dumb."
---
I'm correct, that's all there is to it.
---
It's what playing hearthstone in midwest America is like
---
Doesn't that deck beat odd pally without the mindbreaker?
---
Nah, I just give him what he wants, it's a better approach than the roleplaying game that follows when you call a moron like that out.
---
I like that you went online to search for argumentation errors now that I made you aware that such things exist, seeing as you were obviously oblivious to them before.
---
pretty much this. 
---
i just played a game against odd pally, and even though i had the coin, i had the absolute nuts. i think i played like 50 fireflies against his tokens. he proceeds to play win more cards and only ever hit me in the face (not joking). never punished and i could never win with a fair deck.
---
this is why blizzard prints stupid cards like rexxar or godfrey, because all aggro does is play a 1 drop on turn 1 and away they go. the only come back is stupid cards like that (i don't approve of either in case that wasn't obvious).
---
it is also why in aggro vs aggro, is in my opinion one of the worst match-ups, because it's whoever gets the coin loses. what a betrayal of what got me into hearthstone... even though murlocs were a thing since day 1. /shrug
---
That why Im like Yogg's brawl xD
---
You claim "git gud" isn't something that is said to piss someone off? Don't make me laugh moron. It's the equivalent to being out for conflict. I don't dictate your intentions. Instead, you try to lie, and fail, for some reason.
---
As I said before, because you don't play by the rules of correct argumentation, I don't bother with you either. You get special treatment. I said this before, but still you bring it up like it matters. It doesn't, as I get to dictate how I respond to your garbage.
---
Good that you love it, so do I, since I dominate you to the fullest.
---
weird. i beat every odd warrior i draw rexxar with. maybe because i play slower hunters only.
---
I dont know but these last two round of nerfs has in a way made me play the game less... I dont know why. Usually they make me interested again.
---
As I said before, in your case I just troll and bash you back and won't be doing anything else.
---
Again, exactly the case rofl. You denying it doesn't make it not so, sorry.
---
I'm probably more literate than you are, as you, I would guess, does not speak 3 languages. So again, another failure on your part.
---
I'm not riled up, though I like your (yet another) kindergarten trick (you're mad!1one). I just treat you like the useless shit you are, with contempt.
---
Nozmemu intensifies
---
We are safe guys, her breasts are covered.
---
If they rope, you do the same. In my experience (playing since beta) they stop roping immediately.  They are probably trying to get a free win by annoying other players.
---
[[Metabreaker]]
---
Well technically you got two golden legendaries. 
---
realistically, it was a cutting of the standard beast pool and the addition of cheap lifesteal cards (stealthed knuckles and poison dispatch kodos lol). if the current beast pool existed back then, i think it would've seen play in every hunter deck even though there weren't many. though to be fair i can't remember hunter being played at all in wotft. i remember 3 decent kbc decks, but none from frozen. in fact, i can't remember hunter being played before that either, ever since naxx nerfed undertaker. i don't mean tournament decks, but the actual meta.
---
Only a question out of curiosity, whether it was forced (didn't have it) or they chose not to put it in.
---
Dire frenzy into 2 emeriss, its a super fun deck
---
Reminds me of the original unleash the hounds deck. 
---
You probably don't play wild then?
---
I'm at rank 9 all I see are aggro odd mage, even warlock
---
Someone explain this draft to me.
---
I see 8 cards in this image, six of which are spells, yet there's a book of spectres in the deck. 
---
Three out of the six spells depicted cost 2 or3 mana, yet there's Dragon's Fury in the deck. 
---
Why
---
Ever faced Jaraxxus, Eredar Lord of the Burning Legion?
---
Honestly the first time I played him in arena or a brawl somewhere I tried to emote his "Hello" just to realise after my second click he would repeat that line. My opponent probably felt BMed.
---
I believe it gives you a super strong hero power which can give you both armour and deal damage, being able to play that on turn one would be too much 
---
Maybe... if so, he had pretty good arena and pushed his luck way too far. 
---
It was awesome, to get full RNG power from random spells. I was laughing out loud even in the bus when I was playing. Blizzard - more Brawls like that pls :D
---
Same for me üòÑ. I wanted to  shadowreaper anduin and i got him that i felt so bad 
---
Dude, nobody disagrees with you in there being some conventions shared by most people on this but that doesn't make it "objective" maybe check the definition of that word? 
---
Bih there ain't any wooooshes here 
---
With direction Activation Blizzard is going. You may not be too far behind us lol
---
oof. I'm sorry :(
---
Huh? What do you mean? Of course it's the real Jaina out ther.e
---
Like people are saying, Midrange Hunter.  The minions are cheap, Rexxar is the only Legendary but auto-wins some matchups.
---
Of course it does. And disagreeing puts you back on the troll path: going into "hurrr durr nothing is objective" mode is *de facto* trolling. The second you try that is when you start trolling: when a subjectivity is shared the same way by everyone, it becomes the objectivity of the collective.
---
If the whole human race experiences the same way what is "fully clothed", then fully clothed is objective as a definition. Since you agree that this is the case, then the discussion is effectively over.
---
Could take an idea from chess and make speed (5 minutes for each player) and blitz(1 minute for each player) fo rr the whole game, probably extend the time to make control viable but it could work
---
I play a even hunter with N'zoth in wild with Garrison commander in it, 2/3 good stats makes the Frostgiants chepaer. So I can build two beast per turn. I will post the deck later.
---
the guy was probably bored of all posts about moving Whizbang to classic so he tried this very unusual joke ( but not really a joke though )
---
Dota 2 has mechanical skills to take into account, as well as 10 players in a match which is a lot of moving parts to cause changes.
---
Even then though, at high skill brackets a lot of dotas games are very similar. There was an entire TI that was nothing but deathball push down mid.
---
Don't worry buddy, I dusted a golden Rexxar
---
Theres always pint sized potion + sw horror
---
also blocks OTK Pala's horsemen from activating 
---
I‚Äôm using a similar one. I have Darius, Akali and a couple other differences. I was using forge of souls to draw weapons out because I don‚Äôt own Countess Ashmore. I think I‚Äôll cut the forge of souls for a mindbreaker and maybe cut something else for a battle rage, see what works best.

&gt;Wait, talking about different ways of being dressed is offtopic when talking about what constitutes being fully dressed? That doesn't really make any sense now, does it?
---
It does. If we're discussing the burning temperatures of +100C, it's off topic to talk about the lukewarm temperatures. 
---
What's the name of the actress? For academic purposes ofcourse
---
Are you actually comparing HS to dota? They're so fundamentally different that it would be just as effective to compare HS to racing games when it comes to randomness in that kind of context.
---
That's why I said "moving towards".
---
Also I don't think there is much of a difference between a T1 OTK and an OTK before T10.

Swoosh#1756
---
I think the deckslot argument for equality a bit weak. What am I going to replace equality with in a control paladin deck? There are just no other paladin boardclears really so even in wild the best replacement for 2 mana equality seems to be 4 mana equality.

---
No idea what you play against in wild but Hunter is barely a thing save for the hyper aggressive mech deck (I don't even know whether the deck runs rexxar since it either wins hard or loses hard on by T5).
---
They are going to draw same cards as they did before
---
All 4 of the horseman have amazing voicelines, specially [[Darion]] 
---
It isn't really helpful in constructed either
---
&gt;&gt;They want to have solved the problem by the time the next expansion comes around.
---
&gt;Depending on how he worded this, this may mean that they have the solution figured out before the next expansion, but not implemented. So I wouldn't take this to automatically mean that yet another balance change will arrive before April.
---
Not sure why they would wait once they have found a solution especially since worlds is a few weeks after rotation (market that new set!)
---
&gt;&gt;difficult to keep tight class identities in wild (the few neutral healing cards each year eventually make heal hunter possible)
---
&gt;I assume Iksar is saying this just as a point about Wild, not something they're really concerned about? 
---
This was just a sidenote while discussing class identities. Not much they can do about it.
---
Word police here. 
---
Cost cutting 
---
And they‚Äôll have to play them again, slowing themselves down while you‚Äôve had another turn to draw/prepare defenses or set up your own lethal. There‚Äôs a reason people complain about getting psychic screamed.
---
Sure it does. 
---
Let's say a deck has 60% winrate, 10% are mirrors. 
---
This means the non-mirror winrate is 55/90 - 61.1% while the mirror winrate is 5/10 50%. 
---
Now, the meta morphs completely, and 40% of your games are mirrors. For the non-mirrors the deck maintains the old 61.1% winrate, so 36.66/60 wins. Mirrors are 20/40 still 50%. Total is now 56.66% as opposed to 60% previously, 
---
I'll be honest with you, I wanted to make that joke, but really, I'm just glad somebody did. 
---
Yeah i am pretty confused with that. Hunters are bad at board clears, but good at single target removal, just like druids. Thats why they have hunters mark, deadly shot, crushing walls, and poisonous synergies. Rexxar is a "boardclear" but costs 6 mana so they maybe though it was okey to print it (like spreading plague was for druids).

If they arent suposed to remove big single minions, then are they supposed tohe be bad at removing anything on the board? Does that makes them unable to play slower archetypes unless they have playstiles like freezing the enemy board, vanishing it or psyquicscreaming it? Because those things dont feel very "hunter-y"
---
Craft Genn as only legendary, play Even lock as its easy to play at lower ranks and win. I can give you a balanced Decklist.  After you get good at it add 5 card otk package. 2x Mechanizers Bloodblom Doom mecha'thun for fun. (Guldan and Lich King rotates so its not worth it as ftp. Genn and Baku are some of best neutral legendaries to craft as ftp.) Genn Greymane is good in wild as well. 
---
Guldan is OP as is Lichking, so if you got dust craft this deck. Its Balanced. 
---
Instead of Guldan and Lichking 2x Boonemare

Those are rookie numbers, yesterday i went 0-3 with a deck with 9 demonbolts
---
Does it really? I've never thought of that, but it does make sense, all horsemen winning the game is written as a part of the hero power if I remember correctly. Nice catch.
---
FRC intensifies
---
Flame totem was the reason why having so many cheap tokens useful in that deck.
---
I play a ton of wild.
---
Yeah, strategy was the wrong word.  That's the only sensical thing you've pointed out in any of this.
---
I think it was 3/2, no?
---
It‚Äôd only be the tier above Golden cards that do that. Very rare, very expensive ^hire ^^me ^^^Blizz
---
So I should get 6 demon bolts.
---
I also like war bears a lot, but losing the lich king felt like a real blow when I tried it. The lich king can save games; one special not is the 2 mana, take 5 damage and kill undatakah. You could try replacing grizzlies or drakes to see if that works.
---
BM'ing at rank 20 as hunter lul
---
this ^; I just used mindblast because clone galery it¬¥s a more popular deck right now, but the main reason is the same. Stall until doing you combo.
---
upcomer?
---
It's a rare glitch, that is suitable for dropping a fun fact:
---
Internally heroes are also coded as a card entity within Hearthstone's interaction scheme. If you open up the Hero section in the card collection and search for "basic", you'll get a list of all the 9 basic Heroes.
---
If you search for "epic" instead, you'll see all the alternate Heroes instead.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/7l9o80/morgl_card_apparently_an_epic/
---
Priest is slow but it's usually more closer to a combo deck than a control one (Maly+Velen or Anduin+Mind blast), so fatique is rarely a factor. After PS, they will get those cards one at a time (unless recruit), would need to pay for them and wait a turn to attack, so Priest gets more time to set up his finisher. Finally, in most of the case, it would be cards that are now behind on curves and so far less threatening.
---
They gave you no quarter.
---
Hey thanks for the concern! The deck does very well against otks that attempt to damage you like malygos decks. It does struggle against mecha'thun decks as you can see from my list of poor math-ups. However, you can mill 4 cards with naturalize which won me many games. I also saw very few mecha'thun decks from rank 5 to legend. 
---
there is nothing more satisfying than an aggro pala deck drawing one silver hand recruit, you shuffled back into his deck, after another!
---
Jaina‚Äôs portrait was changed to cover up her cleavage in the last patch. 
---
Yeah, I feel like we're getting a lot of free stuff these days tbh. If you pick up all the freebies you're getting well over half the set(and about half the set isn't playable anyway).
---
This is not that great for a newcomer, who has to catch up previous sets and the value for money for buying extra cards isn't great either(I say as someone who pre-orders), so things aren't perfect, but for established players the freebies are quite generous these days IMO.
---
Decks this is probably not fun to play against:
---
Any Hunter, any Paladin, any other aggro deck.
---
It is not
---
I mean you get a 3/4 instead of an 8/8 taunt but you most likely get more effective health from a second thekal than a second amara
---
Sorry, I'll just go sit there and play hunter litewlly all day
---
and by harder you mean you have to not draw certain cards to win quickly and easily? I agree, controlling which cards you draw is hard.
---
Interesting! Thanks for that info. I'd be curious to investigate deeper.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt think it needs a nerf
---
As soon as I saw the post I knew this comment was going to be here 
---
&gt;they talk a lot about preparation but didn't find a good reason to nerf it at the moment
---
Please don't Nerf prep. I hope they come up with a solution the the ubiquity of the classic set before any more of the cards/archetypes that have been around since the beginning of the game get butchered.
---
Luckily, priest can beat itself if it draws poorly.
---

---
expectations. if people expect and accept randomness in the game its ok.
---
while others want a more general TCG experience i guess
---
Yeah, I think a lot of people are far removed from the new player experience that they think Adventures were great for new players, but they fail to realize that those players don't need cards, they need decks. Nowadays, new players can spend the same amount of gold to get the guaranteed legendaries from expansions then simply dust and craft competitive budget decks right away rather than slowly unlocking wings of disconnected individual cards that are good in decks once you have the rest of the cards available.
---
I find they're about the same until the final boss in monster hunt.  I've always felt like the jump in power level between the first 7 and the last boss is really big in monster hunt and it can be very hit or miss.
---
I like to tech in cards that generates crappy minions for them to resurrect like \[Gravelsnout Knight\] or Leeroy.
---
No doubt, that seems like the best idea for a new format.  But nothing really has made it into the game since TB has been out. We have been saying TB is a testing ground but where is the progress?
---
I would agree here, the final monster hunt boss is a drastic change there, while in dungeon run its a more consistent curve upwad
---
My note 9 does great. Ive never disconnected but play maybe 20 games a week on mobile, so who knows.
---
There's still plenty of copy pasted decks in rank 20, this just happened to not be one of those games.
---
Classes are supposed to have a weakness. Hunter's weakness for the longest time had been card draw and now they have one of the most powerful card draw cards in the game
---
**PEW PEW PEW**
---
Their hero power reflects that
---
I'm pretty sure Bloodworm was out before. And Scalehide, Cave Hydra, and Hunting Mastiff are the real problems and they were all revealed and were the reason we were complaining. We knew they would be good and wanted to use them. 
---
100% agree. Specially Rastakhan Rumble, the art and the voices are very well done in this expansions.
---
My favorites are:
---
*What, you tink you can take ME?*  
---
*Hir'eek, grant me wings!*  
---
And of course:
---
*Cheatin'? I never fight fair!*  
---
Yeah sure rotation would be the moment.
---
do, you'll be a true hero for it

lol, loved it.
---
Yeah the best way to counter it was to play it yourself
---
what other cards did this odd quest priest run? i'm interested
---
I honestly think this is reasonable but it guys classes like Rogue. I would not be shocked if they just completely removed Genn/Baku from the game. And i'd be okay with that decision. 
---
I mean, Valeera is still hanging out in just her underwear.
---
I can hope.
---
There old CFO was "fired" (but he left to become CFO at Netflix) and a new CFO was hire to fill his shoes. the new CFO has put out a blanket statement to cut costs. its one of the reasons why Heroes of the Storm competitive tournaments was getting axed. I've been a big Blizzard Fan for a long time but the future for Blizzard being a powerhouse gaming studio is now put into question.
---

---
I'd say that's _almost_ correct but not quite.
---
The problem isn't that all the good two drops are gone, it's that the goal posts as to what is a "good" two drop have shifted because of other cards.
---
Keleseth is a huge part of this, because every two drop has to be weighed against the value of +1/+1 on everything you draw. Tools like Psychic Scream and Spreading Plague turn your two drops into liabilities. One drops and three drops have become a lot stronger. The ultimate failing of two drops is simply that they are only as strong as they used to be, not stronger.
---
Maybe it will make your opponent think you are using taunt Druid.
---
Is that his winrate under his name? 
---
She now has a piece of clothing covering her breasts
---
To be fair Deadly Shot hasn't historically been great removal, and Hunter's Mark has only recently been super good with Candleshot. I don't think Hunters historically had reliable removal like Mage, Rogue, Warrior Priest (other than 4 attack) did.
---
It's never been viable to have a Hunter deck sit back and remove loads of minions using their efficient removal cards like a Control Warrior could.
---
As far as phased out cards I do unfortunately, to keep up with standard decks. 
---
There's a deck called Bazookadin which just concentrates on the holy wrath otk with Shirvallah. It's basically just centered around board clears, heals, stalling and cycling your deck. Either until your deck is thin enough for the chance of an OTK to be high enough or you drew your entire deck and can deal 50 face damage the turn after.
---
I played it like 100 games (casual, it's a fun deck) and had a decent run. But be aware that it's just as "fun and interactive" to play the deck as it is to play against it. Games play out very similarly. 
---
Looks like a fun event but this isn't "Developer Insight", it's just an announcement
---
*[This sub rn](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/024/207/brainlettttt.jpg)* /s
---
I don't think they know what "insight" means...
---
Control Priest kills with burn in general. It's not really a specific combo. 2 Mind Blasts + 3 Anduin HP (16 damage) and 3 Mind Blasts (15 damage) are nice ways of doing it because Alexstraza takes them down to 15 in one turn, but plenty of times you'll be burning them out at higher or lower life totals.
---
That poor 1/2 guy clearly got lost
---
Why do you think it's doing that?
---
It's because blizzard won't update their fucking deck recipes REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 
---
It's because they painted themselves into a corner with shit like Backstab and SI-7 agent, as well as the hero power. They made Rogue's early game tempo tools so insanely strong that they could no longer print early game stuff for them without making them OP. Prep exists so all Rogue spells need to be horribly overcosted. Weapons are usually garbage because they invalidate the hero power and Rogues usually don't have the health to spare. So all that's left to print for rogue is a bunch of end-game infinite value meme shit. 
---
So you get two situations:
---
* Rogue remains strictly tempo SMOrc 
---
* Somehow Rogue is able to survive into the late game consistently and now they have a bunch of absurdly broken late-game infinite value infinite cloning charging 5/5s and 28/9 infinite lifesteal jade idol bullshit and everyone hates it
---
The Rogue classic and basic set has relegated Rogue card design to either making the entire Rogue set awful and letting them stay as tempo, or giving them some survival tools and creating some insta-win-vs-control Shudderwock-esque torture chamber deck. 
---
Rogue had 1 great sustain card and 1 great life gain card (in a very specific deck). They were both nerfed. Giggling Inventor and Leeching Poison.
---
Full random clown fiesta is honestly a good time.
---
It may be an unpopular opinion, but I love deathstalker. I‚Äôve always wanted control hunter to be decent, and for years it hasn‚Äôt been. Finally, Hunter gets some late game viability, so you don‚Äôt have to play aggro hunter exclusively. 
---
Yes, NZoth mill rogue is great.  Can make for long games though. 
---
Well, naturalize, mulch and recycle are from before KFT. Poison was added as a keyword in KFT too so of course those synergies come after that expansion, same as warlock getting lifesteal synergies.
---
It's actually a lot of tempo AND value; cards in your opponent's deck don't really have value until fatigue becomes a factor.
---
I really hope they don't try to add an anti-Baku or anti-Genn card, I think the only one of those tech cards that's worked well at its job was Golakka Crawler, and that was just painfully game-winning. 
---
Ironically ü§£. Unironically that‚Äôs his health percentage. 
---
To be fair, rush warrior is more of a reactive deck, so it's not that out of place in this specific case. 
---
Yeah I ran into a run of Metha'Thun Druids while leveling so I added in a Geist and it's an instant concede from them because the only thing they have left is a 10 mana 10/10 and fatigue damage.
---
I forgot about Explosive Runes, but in general I don't think any class specific solutions really count because the answer to an oppressive meta shouldn't be "just play class X" because that only trades one form of oppression for another.
---
I wish EMP operative was like "silence the next mech played" or something.  Silence fits more with what an electromagnetic pulse does to electronics anyway.  Fingers crossed for the neutral tech options in the next expansion.
---
The other person tried to explain what a patch was by saying it's a patch, so I guess I'll just say: a patch is a small update to a game, usually a quick or minor one to adjust numbers, fix bugs, or add in relatively small amounts of content. 
---
I spent like an hour checking all those sites. That's why I thought I'd try my luck here
---
I don't understand that Rogue Deathrattle tempo deck. Seems like it is all over the place.
---
I havent had a golden card in 2 expansions. And I buy A LOT of packs.

I did the jade spam with Druid for my only win. 
---
Haha yes of course. As long as you have skill you can take a deck of river crocolisks and elven archers to legend! No offence, but the deck distribution is totally different nowadays. Two dozen packs? Wow, almost 120 cards then. Should amount to the dust equivalent of almost a full legendary! With the three other random legendaries acquired it will probably be a blast playing ranked against full blown netdecks. Like, sure, if you streamed your ascent to rank 5 with a budget deck with one or less legendaries, I'd be very interested to see the videos, no question about it. It does sound very unlikely though.

---
I am not altering the deal, pray I alter it any further
---
Warlock &gt; Shaman &gt; Hunter
---
I'd say it's just a matter of how easy it is to draft a consistent deck for those classes. I'd say warlock can go in a lot of different directions, so you'll almost always end up with a 7+ deck.
---
Hunter favours aggressive strategies - you can't outvalue any class in the late game, so you need the early game aggression to be able to put a clock on them with your hero power.
---
The most successful shaman decks I've drafted relied on bloodlust or quality cards - the latter is obvious, if you get good cards you'll do good with any class.
---
Damn, guess I should go free to play seems to be the key.
---
Same. Warbears are too op in arena, and having 4 of those is a disaster for anyone who runs into him.
---
I like this more than just "open until you get a legend".  Because I've already done that, and still don't have a library that can keep up with the endless stream of frost lich jainas, spell warriors, and kingsbane rogues.
---
Its called salt
---
Also Cho, don't forget Cho
---
So basically its 3 free packs, possible card back and all you are doing is playing the same decks thats in the single player mode in a PvP best of one.  Can we please get some real content or formats.  I'm all for giving players free stuff but this is not anything worthwhile for players that have been waiting for something new. 
---
China has serious issues...

More things that 99.9% of players can't experience. Got it.

Check out the top ranked decks on HSreplays and use those. Or the meta snapshot on tempostorm is pretty good too.
---
Jade druid, just spamming bigger and bigger jades untill you had 30 attack on the board
---
You added an unnecessary 'and' at the end, making the number have a decimal at the end (...777,000.777)
---
Yeah, that's possible too, completely forgot. So many combos. 
---
Alright thanks for the answers, but why did i get downvotes just for axing a question ? 
---
**Summon** means making him appear in the board (either playing it from hand, or from deck, ressumoning him from graveyard, appearing randomly from an evolve effect...)
---
**Play** means only from hand.
---
So yeah, it doesnt work, of course. I wouldnt craft a legendary just for that, you could ask here before crafting it instead of crafting then comming here to complain.
---
I said that Quest Shaman was good against Anyfin Paladin. Obviously, this is because the deck has murlocs which wrecks their combo. 
---
Then, a bunch of people decided that despite the fact that I was the was the one who pointed it out, I somehow didn‚Äôt understand why the deck was good against it and that they needed to let me know it was because of the murlocs. Or that you don‚Äôt need the quest and could just play murlocs. 
---
All of this is not only incredibly fucking obvious, but it‚Äôs also information I very clearly already knew. Hence my confusion.

Oh sweet summer child...you should've played years ago when there were still duplicates and all that crap.
---
Spending 50‚Ç¨ to pre order TGT and only getting a single legendary (Icehowl) out of it...that's real pain.
---
Spellstones and shadow vision (and the insane amount of removal they can create) are the problem with most priests archetypes, the high roll potential of Cloning is not even an issue most games. 
---
What can I use to replace Leeroy? Most decks seem to have him. 
---
How are people this dumb? How can dis be?
---
What was really interesting to me was the bit about Chakki and having to finish media training before being able to appear and speak about the game. Makes you wonder what happened to Donais after that last mishap with the media team and whether or not they banned him from speaking or if it was on his own accord.

it has to do with China being petty about censorship and Blizzard not wanting to lose profit from them

6/7/4 | Deathrattle: Reveal a minion in each deck. If yours costs more, return this to your hand.

1. You're going to have a difficult climb.  There are too many OTK decks against which you basically cannot win.  If you are easily tilted,  these auto-loss matchups will necessitate plenty of breaks.
---
2. To offset these auto-loss matchups,  you need to maximize your good matchups.  This means putting super colliders into your deck.  They are your card advantage engines.

3. Good luck.
