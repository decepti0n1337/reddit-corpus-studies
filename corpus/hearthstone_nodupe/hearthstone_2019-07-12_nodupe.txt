I had a feeling the card worked that way. It explains why Shudderwock didn’t copy it at first.
---
---
---
&gt; That ignores how effectively removing a card from the game via a nerf can allow multiple previously unplayed cards to enter the meta.
---

---
True, that's also possible.
---
&gt; There's also the issue of obsoleting decks indirectly without offering any refunds like you'd get with nerfs.
---
Eh. That's a thing that can happen, but so is nerfing a common card that makes some legendary suddenly unplayable. You won't get your dust back for that legendary, either. The system isn't perfect.
---
&gt; Buffs are less accurate in that regard and run the risk of directly creating problematic cards.
---
It's a possibility, but so far that hasn't happened, has it? Again, we have one card that can even be considered problematic, and that's arguable.
---
Seriously if this expansion doesn’t buff control decks across the board it will be another season of brain dead aggro decks.
---
Warrior.
---
Is this real?
---
Scuffed. It should be called BEEES???
---
Okay I log into, oh look it's a card this will fit nicely in this warrior deck. Some people dont look at every single card that comes out in every single expansion. I have been playing since beta(I did take a break) and I still dont know every single card in every single expansion. Now yes if I was very high up in ranked I expect that players would be more aware of cards and I would see it more often but not at low ranks. My point also wasnt how it was acquired it that it is I standard, if you wanna play crazy stuff there is a wild mode for a reason.
---
except infinite value
---
26 minutes on mobile with bomb warrior, first try. Seemed pretty easy
---
&gt;not true or cosmetics wouldn't be a thing.
---
Why not? players like them. My point is that *you* like the cosmetics you have and might enjoy your collection/favourites, etc. Other players do not know or care what your collection or favourites are.
---
And you say my opinion isn't unpopular but here I am getting downvoted lol.

Pretty boring. Random card generation is not such an exciting mechanic IMO

Interesting... Right after the interview in which they said they "learned their lesson" about infinite value, and that the new Quests' rewards would NOT be infinite value... \^\^
---
but after implosion you have imps... after this your bees are dead
---
If I recall correctly, those are usually set and not random. I got the same two you describe, for example. So you probably won't get a different legendary quest
---
I can’t tell if he is hunky cute guy or adorable teacher.
---
Same lol not sure why people are complaining
---
This card isn't even an issue. You are dumb
---
&gt;The system isn't perfect.
---
I didn't say it was, but at least it *allows* for that potential and has done so in the past.
---
&gt;It's a possibility, but so far that hasn't happened, has it?
---
No, but we're talking about nerfing and buffing in general, and in regards to addressing balance issues in a meta, nerfs are better than buffs in pretty much every way.
---
Ye I'm bored of seeing that class going full random too. You're not even playing your deck, the deck itself gives you another random deck that sometimes can work, and sometimes just tells you to gtfo walk your dog. I'd rather play anything else that is consistent even though I've been liking mage a hundred times more than all other classes since the beginning of Hearthstone.
---
I am disappointed.
---
You can beat ragnaros earlier though. I did it turn 2 with hand of rafaam, double starting boom bot treasure, and a 24/24 Edwin off bag of coins.
---
Yes, but we see the mage quest reward. While none of the "infinite" value we bitch about is actually infinite, that hero power is the same crap we call infinite.
---
Online, from my home, sitting at my desk, comfortable. Notice how i am not out at fuck knows where surrounded by an unpredictable number of people i do not know? see the huge diffrence there?  
---
Look i do not care that much about this specific content personally but it is just really fucking stupid to me to lock it away like that. For those that do want to to play it but cant get to a gathering it is a problem tho and they shouldnt lock away actual content like that.  
---
  
---
That said if YOU like gatherings then by all means go to them, enjoy yourself and have a blast man.  
---
Honestly i wonder how many people have no idea gatherings are even a thing or that you can get a hero or do this at them.
---
Looked up MtG Bee Sting. How does that exist in the same game as MtG Lightning Bolt? Jesus, and people think the strictly worse cards in Hearthstone are bad.
---
What the hell lol. Have you tried closing and re-opening the app?
---
No, not really. The corniest man I know is hispanic.
---
Not a fan of that design. I thought the Druid and Warlock quests were much more reasonable with no infinite value attached to them. I suspect people are going to start severely hating on this in about 2 months, just like for the DKs.
---
I can’t really see this bringing mage up to be a suitable climbing deck unless there will also be more tempo cards to support it.
---
Control shaman is nearly a 50/50 split so far against control warrior, with all the new cards and quest it would most likely have the majority, it certainly won’t lose hard
---
What are you doin with those stacks of 40 packs friend?
---
Damn, what kind?
---
Does any one know if this will work against Reborn minions?
---
Now the real question is can you play 2 quests at once?
---
BEES!! https://media.giphy.com/media/dcubXtnbck0RG/giphy.gif
---
So how does this work in wild can you use both quests at once, or is it one at a time? If you can use both do they both start in hand?
---
I would like the buff patch better if it didn't include Snipsnap.  By far the best 'new' card from the patch was that mech, and unfortunately, it is the largest buff to Bomb Hunter (already a good deck) and Bomb/Control Warrior (also already good decks) compared to its impact on other classes.
---
Besides that, most of the buffed cards that see play, see play in new decks to this meta.  That's fantastic.  I don't mind if some of the buffs whiffed; actually, I am glad that not all the buffed cards were pushed into meta viability, as that would feel like a "forced" meta.  Pocket Galaxy does lean towards the frustrating side of things, but honestly, I think it is one of the less frustrating ways to lose to that deck...
---
It feels like we could have seen a lot more freshness if they hadn't bolstered the existing T1 decks like they did.  For a first try at a buff patch, I actually think this is pretty good.
---
Having in game achievements and rewards would be a great addition to the next solo adventure. I could definitely see a time trial being an achievement as well
---
We do have a royal palace in Hawaii, actually.
---
Everybody gangsta till the wasp ridding-lightning spiting cobra shows up.
---
The wording on the tooltip doesn't clear anything up. If you're using BEEES! on your own minion, it would be dealing excess damage on your turn.
---
Your other reasoning makes sense though. Overkill only makes sense with attackers.
---
Gruul you say?   
---
IM GONNA DO IT
---
Especially difficult as rogue considering BEES is a Druid card.
---
Not sure you understand what strictly worse means if you're calling Mass Hysteria strictly worse than brawl
---
I love this copypasta
---
Does exactly one (1) priest thing and exactly one (1) genericish thing for a reasonable cost. I'm not seeing the complaint really. It's not a great card, but it's a priest card.
---
What is Rafaam hero power?
---
Those exclamation marks should just be a question mark
---
I like the fact that if this was on custom heartstone Trump would have rated it 1 for balance and 1 for design.
---
You know it as much as I do.
---
Nine mana is a lot for a board sweeping effect. Functionally, it is a nine mana Psychic Scream, which is way to slow to rely on saving your from aggression.
---
By the nature of its cost, it is a rather narrow card.
---
Leeroy and Shadowstep does the same for less
---
Cast or stock removal? Neat piece.
---
It's not really free though, it's a card in your hand instead of some other card that might actually do something or generate more cards immediately. I have no idea why so many people think a card that does nothing other than generate long-term value belongs in a combo deck. What deck in the meta are you going to improve your win rate against by generating random spells one turn at a time? You're going to keep up with Dr. Boom?
---
i had that come up for me 3 times in the tavern brawl. but I still need to read the cards to understand the game so I declined it  to not shoot myself in the foot.
---
And it broke the Antorus raid for a whole week.
---
I appreciated that :D

Hero powers have always been "infinite value" to some degree, and this doesn't seem nearly as offensive in that regard as Build a Beast or Delivery Drone, nor does it seem as powerful as several of the other Death Knights' hero powers.

Easy, but will take longer (in a good deck) than many people might think.

Regardless of whether you think it'll be good or bad, you can't judge the potential a card has without looking at other cards of similar effects.

Additionally, when pro players look at cards, they look at cards based on their individual power level as well as based on the meta. A card not fitting into the meta doesn't mean it's a bad card.

I hate big priest because it’s so common between 10-15 which is where I usually sit. I don’t play enough to grind to rank 5-10 anymore and I typically prefer value based matchups and it’s just so hard to out-value big priest.
---
I'm very sure the "sky temple" is from the Throne of the Four Winds. It's Al'Akir's place that flies over Uldum.

Agreed. Especially weird when you consider how the reno in [[Pilfer]] looks more like the original design, so its not like they wanted to redesign him.
---
Damnit I actually read everything you wrote.. your point of the Terrible Secret about the Meta makes me think you have zero idea what you're talking about or something.  It's the same every rotation.. certain classes dominate the first part, and certain ones are terrible, most notably priest.  Its because the sample size of cards is so small the start of the new standard rotation.  So whatever class has the best classic cards will be the best.. and by the end of the last expansion they do so much making up for priest being crappy all year they print Outragous things like Psychic scream.  And priest gets its moment in the sun.  That's what really happens.  Every year.  Maybe you should actually just copy decks offline like you talked so bad about.. because based on your apparent lack of core knowledge of the game, I say you're not having fun because maybe you just arent good.

Doesn't it just change the way your cards are rendered, client side?

It doesn't use any information that your client doesn't already have; it's not like you can use these mods to look at the cards in your opponent's hand.
---
&gt;And for all our sakes, just don't go making already good cards better.
---
*looks in Thunderhead's general direction*
---
I still don't understand that buff, to be honest. The card was already good, but making it an "over the top" statline on top of the huge text on it? 
---
It's not like Shaman was in the dumpster or anything.
---
Also, with the cards revealed in this expansion so far, it looks like they're pushing shaman super hard... 
---
If there's just a few more decent cards revealed for the class, shaman is gonna be NUTS next expansion.

You lost 35 dust because of a mistake you made. You knew the rewards were one of each.
---
There's no way you're getting Kabal Lackey, Medivh's Valet and a secret 50% of the time by turn 2 even if you run 26 secrets. If it's true, you're using anecdotal evidence of a small sample size.
---
How does it add a copy of itself to your deck and draws that copy of itself? I think you're confusing something here.
---
This Hero Power does not add any new cards into your deck, where it would actually matter for Fatigue purposes, instead it only fills up your hand, giving no protection from Fatigue whatsoever.
---
It sure is infinite value, however only in hand, not in the deck.
---
What am I missing?
---
It was never drawn, that's why. Bombs only explode when drawn, and if burned, they never actually enter your hand.
---
Inb4 nerfed

Yeah but now you can really, really only play two cards a turn.

---
Because you don't want to Mulligan giants in order to play the quest. Giants mage are a deck about creating a big board and killing their opponent in 2/3 turns instead of generating value. You play cyclone and that shit because it's a way to get you to the point where you can create the insane boards. it doesn't make sense to play both things because they have different win conditions, you don't want to actively dump your hand while playing giants mage, you look for gigantic swing turns with cyclone. But after that the game shouldn't last more than 3/4 rounds
---
Agree to disagree I guess.
---
Priest Quest play 10 neutral taunts, hero power passive:deathrattles trigger twice.
---
Overkill with Bees interaction- I am gonna end Gurubashi-Bees interaction's whole carreer
---

---
If they keep releasing expansions bundles for $110AU then it might. This is absurd pricing and precisely why I became a FTP player. I can only speak for myself but blizzard has priced themselves out of the market by expecting me to pay that much for potentially average cards and a hero skin.
---
No, it doesn’t. Hobgoblin gave buff to cards that you play from your hand that had 1 attack. Not summoned minions.
---
Warrior was very very hard, took like 200 bosses. The rest was cake, except for Druid which was very hard to get my synergies with, took almost a hundred. And then priest was just fking stupid, every time I grabbed battle totem I didn’t get cthun, every time I grabbed stealth I only got bigs and taunts, every time I grabbed the 5 cost card, I only got smalls. I never lost to the first or second boss before with any other class. It was under a hundred but damn this one was the most frustrating.
---
Quest would probably be played at heavy tempo or pure control deck. Aggro Shaman won't quest at his mulligan and it's overall slow.
---
Did that one already and I had lots less trouble with that one. Only rakhan’s left then I’m done
---

---
Sort of ashamed i read through 3/4 of that seriously.
---
The quest doesn't fit cyclone mage or pocket Galaxy mage tbh. I see a quest mage with mana cyclone being created but with a completely different gameplan from the current cyclone mage deck (which is a dumb deck name because the deck is defined by giants and not cyclone)

1. Since the wording is attack, the Bees can be used to prematurely trigger Freezing Trap and Snake Trap.

2. Wild Combo: Addled Grizzly Combo to turn the bees into 2/2? If so, Druid now has options to kill giants.

You're wrong, unless they change how it works before the patch drops

It does have to be on your turn though, it isn't *just* deal excess damage.

---
Yes. Then it dies. Horribly.
---
There's quite a lot of decks, at least in wild, where the namesake card or combo is the alternative wincon. Mecha'thun lock for example tends to win moreso through dropping a couple big demons rather than the combo (against aggro and midrange, which are the two most prominent kinds of decks). Similarly Jade idol in druid rarely tends to be more than a Jade golem per match, with big taunts and armour doing most of the heavy lifting. Idol's main job is to be a wincon against classic, reactive control decks without a combo kill or similar to clow out matches. (Then we have people who wonder why odd warrior struggles against Jade druid, when Odd is its natural prey.)

---
It seems as if they are hopelessly addicted to one-card build-arounds and massive swing turns as the way games are won, with those things intended to be counterbalanced by aggression. 
---
Building up incremental advantages toward a win has been deemphasized for long time. You don't kill them fast enough, and then the big swing just demolishes everything you've done so far in the game, or the value engine comes online and it outeighs all your modest moves.
---

I don't take offense I just find it annoying that everyone makes these assumptions that they know how a card is going to act based on assumptions. \[\[Mayor Noggenfogger\]\] text says "Targets Chosen Randomly" It does not say "Targets Chosen Randomly from valid targets" but if you attack it can't be redirected to an enemy minion.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Not to mention fro your original comment of "If you are familiar with the HS". The thing is there has never once been a card in the history of the game that has allowed you to make a targeted attack against a friendly minion. There have been ways to make friendy's attack each other but that has always been a random effect which can work differently than targeted effects. For Example, if you mind control tech a full board you kill the minion on the other side. If you try to Mind Control a minion with a full board you simply can't. Which is something I doubt most folks even know

9/5/4 | All targets are chosen randomly.  
---
Linecracker gets attack doubled by overkill.
---
Youre thinking of Gahrzilla.
---
Overkill doesn't work when minion is attacked :/
---
and playhearthstoneFR is still dead
---
How does it work for other non-American countries? Have some examples?
---
But your opponent has to change class for pilfer to work!
---
(It doesn’t LUL)
---
People don't want to play your cancerous netdecks in Casual. Simple as that.
---
It's bad enough that everyone plays the same unfun and braindead shit on ladder. Give people at least one game mode where they can get away from it.
---
Just sort by new. It’s all there.
---
Sad to see people downvoting the truth. At least the majority on this sub supports me.
---
No worries. I generally agree that, while mass hysteria is nuts against some boards, there are lots of boards (such as high health ones) that it's bad against and is usually worse than brawl. Priest really wants psychic scream back lol
---
Your hunter deck, you win early or you give up late game. Depends on the specific deck list as for how to improve.
---
Np, I got my golden rare and stopped, keep working hard for me.
---
Need to see it to know what to change
---
Looks like you’ve been cursed. You’ll need to paint a Hearthstone logo on your front door using the blood of your firstborn child to keep him away from you.  If you hear “Here it comes!” at any point of the night while you’re asleep, then you didn’t draw the logo right and you’re in some deep shit (I’ve gone through this once).
---
 If you start to hear his tiny footsteps coming towards you, have a weapon ready and be prepared to play Ice Block in real life. 
---
Good luck fellow gamer!! 😟
---
This is GOLD. Lol
---
The deck is probably good.
---
If your early is good, attack more the eneny hero and let hin do the trades. Looks like you are playing an aggresive deck but with a slow control playstile.
---
Go face!
---
I just beat the brawl after picking Hand of Rafaam twice too.
---
EZ MODE
---
Just don’t watch the remake. The original is crazy messed up.
---
That seems likely gwent.
---
Does this make [[Cult Master]] playable?
---
mate ive been playing since naxx and habe reached legend many times as well. However ive never been top 100 so mad respect on that. I still disagree with you tho
---
Try to reroll and you'll get a warning telling you that rerolling a legendary quest will give you a normal quest.
---
Which actually seems kind of backwards. Overkill is basically a deathrattle for enemies since it requires the minion specifically to die before it can trigger. I could see how there would be an issue checking it after the minion is removed but that still seems more like what should happen.
---
Ignore them.
---
Casual is casual, doesnt matter if you win or you lose. You are free to play what its fun for you. Dont let others force you to play something unfun just because they are the ones that want to have the fun. They can concede in casual without any penalty and no need to add you to insult.
---
Keep playing that mech hunter if you like it!
---
Play it in every single deck of course
---
I'm playing on MOBILE, I'm going to post it. 1 minute
---
It sucks because in the lunar event you could reroll the legendary quest for another one
---
Are we gonna ignore the fact that if there exis a creature that can swallow the moon, its weight alone will cause more problems due to gravitation, than him swallowing the moon?
---
even in alpha and beta this game was about one-turn swings, don't remember massive stealthed edwins? charging mountain giants? lol
---
In wild it could have summoned dirty rat
---
Her old voice lines were better :(
---
Wow, one single specific matchup during a specific month doesnt mean thats all "old hearthstone", man...
---
I'm running arch and hearthstone runs just fine with tzdata 2019b-1 what makes you think that is your issue?
---
Yeah, token druid has been using some more expensive cards lately, and this has the possibility of brining [[Cult Master]] into viability. If anything can do it, it's this.
---
I perspnally think of tommy boy everytime I see this meme
---
[[Linecracker]] doubles it's attack as overkill, not when it survives damage. [[Gaz'rilla]] ok the other hand does that ^in wild and as a hunter card
---

4/4/2 | After a friendly minion dies, draw a card.  
---
You still want some mid to early game with dice or you’re gonna get screwed by it at some point.
---
You're welcome
---
It's used as a figure of speech.
---
is it the one with the goblin nazis?
---
Ohhhhhh I just reread the overkill mechanic. I always thought the card had to be the damage initiator to trigger the effect. Instead its just that the card's damage is dealt on your turn. Well, I learned something new
---
I think you are correct
---
Hold him in hand for Piloted Reaper, or use him as a Call to Arms target, or Play him with Rat Trap down
---
Heartston plays great on my brick of a 5s
---
upgrade to Xs
---
The nostalgia goggles are strong in this one!
---
Where do I sign
---
This will be an insane draw engine with cult master as well.
---
 I want at least 1 synergistic card with Big Shaman archetype. I just love the deck but it is not in a good place right now.
---
VALUE
---
It's mediocre. Might still makes the cut but cable rat and sludge slurped provide a second battlecry, and cost as much mana.
---
Would craft this so hard.
---
Actually wouldn't mind the Oprah "BEES" meme version either, come to think of it.
---
Save it until you want to craft a legendary you want.
---
Hey Qwenthur, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "Petition". Calling a thread a petition is essentially a subtle request for agreement upvotes, and petition threads generally tend to be poor prompts for constructive discussion.
---
Sfp4#1775 NA 80g quest, ill show you go first, have a trade history

Cable is a second battle cry for quest, better post quest, and gets the lackey immediately

Does Kripp still shill for G2A and complain about being stream sniped every time he loses?
---
Seems pretty great in Hunter.
---
Welcome to the heart-pumping, high-risk, high-reward tier of Hearthstone. A turn 1 (with coin) 4/4 is devastating against certain decks. The downside is significant, but do you feel lucky?
---
&gt; There is a risk that future expansions might boost this effect to undesirable heights – like how people often disliked Jade decks – but that remains to be seen.
---
Maybe you should read the pogo part again.
---
&gt;He is a known Priest hater and Rogue lover so no surprises there.
---
He mentions in his stream how incredibly bad blizzard's decision making is, because Priest has no playable deck. I wouldn't call that a hater. 
---
&gt;There's a really awful double standards in this sub in general against Priest and in favor of Rogues..
---
What do you think is the reason for this?
---
I also didn't get it at first, have fun!
---
control decks?
---
yah that's what I figure -- poor chap just keeps losing em
---
Same here. The game will run after a fresh install, then after the first disconnect I am unable to even load into the game. It just sits at the startup screen. Clearing cache and app data do nothing. I'm on a Galaxy s8+  I thought it might have something to do with the new pie update since I've had a lot of other issues.
---
Half the sets aren't played. GvG for instance has like 4 playable cards in the format, everything else is just for memes. If you dusted everything after rotations then rip, foolish move.
---
It isn't Dalaran
---
Don’t forget you get deaths shadow as a hero power
---
This card could easily break wild.
---
emperor thaurissan 1 turn + Linecracker + 2 * Bees + 1* Earthen Scales
---
= 1turn 1280 armor.
---
If you have two Earthen Scales then that is 2560 armor. If you addin one Abusive Sergent you will get 3587 armor. For the rest of the deck you can just filled jade as wining condition, with ramp and card draw.
---
Why are you booing him? He's right
---
Whoa about an hour ago this happened to me with an opponent’s emotes.
---
Not sure if this is linked but I was watching stranger things yesterday and now I’m not gonna sleep
---
Wait, I thought Overkill only works offensively, not defensively. If you run Ironhide into something, it can summon the Runt, but running the BEES!!!! into the Ironhide won’t do anything.
---
Also if you get the spell which turns all of your minions into legendary minions reduced to 0, you can just get turn 1 wins if you get more leeroy/sky captain kragg/king krush than the darkness.  T1 is pretty good I would say.
---
Bro just keep scrolling lol
---
I understood it as effecting all android 6 users. I've been able to play after reinstalling, however as soon I close out, I can't get back in and have to reinstall. I've been catching up on my reading...
---
They're NEAT and call backs, but they don't do anything other than that.  The Nozari reno thing is coincidental.  Otherwise Nozari has a lot in common witha  treant spell.
---
It’s something that I want to try eventually. Right now Mint does everything I want to do, so I struggle to find a reason to dabble with only limited free time. Though like you say, I doubt I’d ever go back once I do!
---
Well I've only been playing since dec 2017.  Honestly i should just dust all my wild cards though.
---
MrWizard#1236 NA Have 80g quest for trade, ill show but you go first! Have many successful trades!
---
It should be active now. Conceding equals a play FYI.
---
It's simple
---
&gt; it is just the ilusion of it.
---
Are you saying people feeling like they are having fun aren't really having fun? Wtf is this even supposed to mean?
---
&gt;My experience against Rogue is me rolling my eyes for 8 turns
---
Yeah, but people seem to be really ok with it, even seem to like it. Maybe you are just the rogue hater?
---
&gt;This is an oversimplification of the Priest combo playstyle. But yeah you just reinforced my point there. That's exactly how ppl feel Priests play like.
---
&gt;&gt; the opponent spams saps, backstabs and such to everything I play while spaming lackeys and other random generated stuff, then I clear the board and they finish me off with some sort of leroy into shadow step or double evicerate or something like that.
---
ok, bud. Let's agree to disagree here
---
Except its not free, its an investment.  You provide content so people keep playing your game.  Otherwise, they stop playing and you don't make money.  Its called an incentive.  And the incentives just aren't all that great, especially when its clear they didn't take the 10 minutes to look at the decklists and make adjustments as needed.
---
In the same vein, blizzard made tavern brawls only have 1 hour downtime instead of 2 days.  But realistically, it shouldn't ever have been a 2 day affair with the mountain of cash Blizzard sits upon.
---
I'm saying its poor optics.  It creates a disconnect between what the company has in terms of resources and the product they are pushing out to consumers.
---
Maybe off-topic, but I noticed 1.6k is an abbreviation for 1600 that has the same number of characters, but requires an additional keyboard to type
---
yeah the chance to roll a heads would be 1-the chance that you roll no heads.
---
Weird story... during brawliseum I got added by a #8 legend player after I beat them with a deck I’d made myself. I hadn’t played ladder in a couple months so I was like Rank 16. 
---
He was a proper c**t.
---
To be fair... neither is Nicolas Cage.  😎
---
Berserker was the first card I though about when this was announced
---
Sent
---
&gt; non-Legend Priest player like me
---
Yay! Another Priest player complaining their precious, special class isn't competitive in Standard! We've almost met quota for the month!
---
There's always going to be a worse class, and Priest really hasn't been that in at least a year prior to Rise of Shadows.
---
You drew the short straw this time. Druid drew it after the nerfs in Rumble format, Mage drew it in Boomsday, and Warrior drew it in Witchwood.
---
The issue you see lies more in your enjoyment of the game being way too dependent on Priest being decent in Standard. I would either try to play it in Wild, where it is much better even disregarding Big Priest, or try out Paladin since that seems to be the only class you don't have an issue with that has viable decks to play with.
---
Plus, Dr. Boom, Mad Genius isn't broken. Powerful, yes. Broken, no.
---
I have gotten those messages before. Sucks. 
---
But on the other hand, I’ve gone to casual to test out my home brew decks and gotten stomped by hunter after hunter after hunter.... so I kinda get it
---
Kibler thinks literally everything should be HoF'd.
---
Kibler thinking something should be HoF'd means it's a day that ends with y.
---
Not surprising
---
The best time I've seen posted here was 15 minutes.
---
I'd be okay if it was 12 mana 1/1 "Taunt. Has +1/+1 and costs (1) less for each spell you've cast this game". Vulnerable to silence, but who cares, if your taunt is silenced, you probably lost anyway.
---
Mining, brothels and gambling.
---
I have one too.  Just keep it to admire the animation.
---
Don't call them infinite value generators since that's the wrong term to use.
---
Why would that be fun?
---
Yeah, but you can usually find turns when your hero power is bad for the situation. Usually with kaboom or zap cannon
---
Did you read my comment? Boom’s not the only reason other control decks don’t see play. Also you fail to address what makes ysera any more of a win condition than boom. I’m not talking about card types here.
---
Problem with that card is it only targets non mechs, and mechs are so prevalent, especially in aggro decks, that it often doesn't get many targets.
---
[https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-135/](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-135/)  
---
I don't really care about anything below rank 5, and since I play only on NA I don't care about other regions either.
---
It just deals with OP's situation, of course it won't beat the entire deck. But since you are a Rogue, it gives you a good chance to win before or on such a turn 8, turning the matchup from even (among all brackets, so maybe slightly unfavored in better ranks) to favored (even).
---
Literally had the same thing happen to me last week
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/rKSdH0a
---
Oh wow I didn't even notice the 8 minions
---
Dust it and craft normal Millhouse, is this even a question?
---
thats 28 damage in two turns if you set up two gurubashis, and thats if he wont attack it. if he attacks it for less than 3 damage its over 30 lmao
---
accept that sometimes you draw the nuts and sometimes your opponent draws the nuts and queue next
---
Grave horror in itself is balanced
---
Kinda bullshit honestly. I had the perfect run and finished under 30 minutes only to find out it counts time when you're not playing and I had to take a break between games.
---
&gt;I also find it strange that you call ysera a win condition but Dr Boom doesn’t count for some reason?
---
Because Boom is boring to play against it. They drop it on 7 or as soon as they draw it and there's nothing you can do. Ysera is on the board and something you can actually interact with.
---
So yeah, Dr. Boom is a win condition, just not a particularly fun one to play against
---
&gt; is not enough, poisonous minions are garbage and they would be frozen anyway, deadly shot would kill only one giant etc etc.
---
depends on the class. I play shaman the most and they have a ton of ways of dealing with the giants (hex, scheme, thunderhead + overload), one of the most overlooked is forcing opponent to use cards early so they can't just hold cards to get their giants down earlier. If they have to double ray of frost something early, you basically force them to have to pull off a huge cyclone turn to stay in it.
---
I theorycrafted a deck for this with Linecracker

---
My ad/tracker blocker is currently blocking 133 different requests :P
---
Oh yeah it's big brain time
---
but of course complaints about the content make for the best content.
---
There's always going to be a worse class, and Priest hasn't taken had that spot in upwards of two years. Every format between MSoG to RR has featured a strong Priest deck if not several.
---
A weak Classic and Basic line-up for the class allows the class to play and feel different every year unlike Rogue, which basically plays or played the same twenty or so cards in every incarnation of Tempo or Miracle Rogue. 
---
Granted, Priest's Classic and Basic line-up really only lacks a good win condition, which is a good thing for the game long term, while boasting one of the best one drops, the ability to play a twenty-eight card deck, two of the best pieces of single target removal, and more than a handful of cards that have seen use in and out of formats.
---
I would hate it, except it walks all over Warrior and I hate Warrior far more. So that makes me actually love it.
---
Ysera doesnt give your Minions rush and has 5 different hero powers. Boom is a win condition and a removal, thats why he is a problem.
---
It's just annoying to click five times to reroll, there is no reason for it.
---
I finished under 30 minutes of playtime but it didn't count because I had to take a break between games, was a perfect run.
---
I'm not a huge Kibler fan but he has been vocal about his criticism of blizzard multiple times before. He does events for them but he is far from a shill.
---
&gt; “old control warrior” you’re referring to is literally from the beginning of the game. 
---
How is this a counter-argument?
---
I often wonder how Blizzard should change Millhouse to make him playable. As-is he's just too high risk to ever be viable.
---
So there is no reason to watch several streams?
---
You can reroll in a sense. Uou just need to commit dishonorable sudoku.
---
It's hard to keep your disguise as a dragon - all humans look alike.

Im watching the new season, almost done, tbh, the constant flickering of the lights is getting on my nerves, like... do something else, it is so obnoxious (imo)

otherwise Im having fun with the show, cant wait to see it go down :)

ily buddy, hope you have a good day
---
The reveal goes out of its way to point out that reno is a narcissist that is only in it fo the gold
---
At least the memes and shitposts occasionally make me laugh a little.
---
The 4 millionth post complaining about whatever deck someone just lost to.....  how long can dis go on??
---
The heroes are getting weapons dong @ me
---
Ugly card art imo. Thoughts?
---
Blizzbabs can't appreciate deep mommy voices like Nozari's and Shirvallah's
---
Alright, Im starting to see a deck forming here. Bee Shaman with windfury and eureka. If anything sticks you win
---
I beliebte the figure of speech normally uses "Fake OCD". It may just be a wrong memory though as english isn't my first language.
---
When the nerfs happened to rogue "majority of people" were saying that it is direct nerf to warrior which was not true. Warrior win rate/ played rate went up. 
---
Your last statement is not true at all. Rogue is one of the popular class to play in hearthstone. Losing to control warrior and freeze mage feel alot more bad than rogue (just look at reddit and the post about them-- no one is making post about shark being op).
---
There's a card called Lunar's Porcket Galaxy now and Mage can generate enough cards to get one if not they are running it already. And as I recall that's why they Hall of Shame'd Ica Block right? Now MAge has more tools like the Twinspell to freeze enemy minions or cheap spell generator mechanics. I lost many games to Antonidas + Appraentice + Mirror Images + Freeze + Burn in last months. Quest Mage was one good counter deck at higher ranks where Control Priest and C. Warlock were pretty strong. 
---
For Priest, keeping your minions alive is not so easy. That's why Midrange and Tempo Priest decks are not viable unless there are some broken Dragons. Silence Priest is a shitty deck. All other clases have early removals/denials/weapons/heropowers as they were designed to be geared for a tempo game. I'm not going to list all. In the last three months I placed every control card and resurrection mechanic without the D. Spirit + Inner Fire combo, wondering if I can create a late game strategy with the cards Blizzard designed for me. Like a Big Priest, but not with huge minions, and enough slots to add more removals and board clears. My biggest drop was Catherina, and I ran Grave Horrors because I had a lot of spells. I wasn't even close to a climbing WR. Against Control, I ran out of cards in my hand and got a lot of face damage enough to cause me the game even if I still have cards in my deck. I tried running Elysiana and Bwonsandi in diffrrent decks but nothing works. You can't resurrect pyromancer can you? And you can't win the game if you have a late game plan that will work vs. both Control  and Aggro. Priest removals doesn't win Priest the game, you have 2x of each, and you need to hit your opponent in the face to kill them.

Can u link it here?

I meant in contructed especially wild but yeah big priest is pure cancer. If anything its gonna be the deck that makes me quit this game.

 "I think omega devastator isn't that good, because it can't deal perfectly with one specific deck, which can be beaten anyways with my other removals."
---
Ukab the Suneater confirmed?
---
Is that why people were crying about rogue when it had lower winrates than hunter? Both pre-nerf and post-nerf?
---
Entitled prick still living with his mom
---
What if they changed CC to only pull from the pool of minions playable by Mage?  Probably inconsistent with other "random" affects, but also means they don't have to think of CC every time they make a new big minion...
---
A good way to upgrade it with time is to use beasts synergies, like scavenging hiena, and other low cost beasts. It will make your deck stronger, more consistent.
---
Feel free to look in the internet for what decks are people trying to get ideas on how to upgrade your deck, or what things you want your deck to do.
---
Works great on my iPhone XR
---
Unless you're hauling your PC to a Fireside Gathering, yes
---
You’re totally right, I’m definitely biased lol
---
Everyone brought decks that are good against warrior expecting everyone else to bring warrior like last week.
---
^Found a warrior player that somehow still manages to lose
---
Lol at those winrates.  
---
Basically just an advertisement for how over powered omega assembly is in the current warrior when combined with Boom.  
---
All good, nothing to see here, carry on.
---
You now get a guaranteed legendary in the first 10 packs you open from an expansion. No more duplicate legendaries. Whizbang and Zayle Shadowcloak will generate full deck when put into a deck.
---
You should either buy packs from the expacs which are in standard right now until you hit a legendary, then go to the next one or save up fro the upcoming expansion.
---
Some adventures a free to play, just go into solo to check them out. The newest one had to be bought with gold or cash (they don't reward cards anymore, purely for fun/some packs/cardbacks).
---
Will still have well over 50% win rate.
---
I mean of course the winrate gonna be high because whenever a warrior plays omega assembly they've probably already won(because they made it to turn 10)
---
I was thinking he was going the other way but whatever
---
Pyroblast is direct damage tho
---
Invoice Number are just the cursed number from LOST series: 4-8-15-16-23-42
---
What's the fastest run completion so far? 21 minutes feels pretty insane, I didn't even think I'd get it in under an hour.  
---
Hand of Rafaam taking up their early turns, allowing me to build a board presence, and Bag of Coins allowing me to cheat out a giant Edwin, really swung the games hard in my favour.  
---
I always lost to Vaelastrasz, as the mill game would completely overrun me, but this game I managed to get lucky and have some Faldori Striders onto the board, which proceeded to summon a bunch of Leylines.
---
First time playing with Togwaggle too, I've tried Boom and Hagatha, and ended up always losing to Vaelastrasz.
---
This was honestly a blast, and I had a load of fun powering through this.
---
I know right? Releasing it on the 4th of July was a great choice, no one's too busy to watch until the middle of the afternoon!
---
That's completely false against Warrior.
---
1. I would recommend buying Rise of Shadows Packs until you get a legendary, then start saving for the newest expansion Saviors of Uldum, which releases August 6th. If you're just coming back now you kind of missed some good stuff, as Blizzard gave out some free legendaries that expired two weeks ago, but it's not impossible to keep playing. 
---
2. You're probably missing a lot of cards from the last 3 years, so I'd recommend dusting all of your wild cards since you can't really play in that mode anyway. Assuming you played a lot before One Night in Karazhan, you should get a good amount of dust from disenchanting any Wild cards you have. 
---
3. Lastly, Solo Adventures were free for some time, but recently, starting with the last expansion Rise of Shadows, they made The Dalaran Heist, a new paid adventure. It costs 2800 gold or $20 to unlock the whole adventure, but if you don't like solo play, it's not worth it since you only get 15 packs and a pretty much useless legendary from it.
---
Wow cool!
---
Throw in splintergraft and you might get Rank 15.
---
There's no doubt about what the best class is. But it is easy to counter. So some brought counter decks, and some counters to those. Look at past GM line-ups. They constantly bring the (counter-)counter to what was most popular previously.
---
Lol, just because I didn't agree with you.
---
Yes, easily and that's generally the game plan.  
---
Bomb warrior can pick up earlier kills but with the majority now being control warrior the game plan is structured around getting to 10, there isn't a lot that's going to pick up the win earlier except incredibly RNG and really and really bad play by the opponent.
---
For sure and I agree, I just think that if one deserved to be Hall of Famed more than the other then imo it would be Mountain Giant, but there are strong cases to be made for either, or both. You can at least play around Sea Giant by putting less minions in play or killing off 1/1's or something, but it's hard to play around an opponent's hand size.
---
Damn. Seeing that sorta work with only 4 upvotes is just sad.
---
Since the bees take up board space you only get 2 copies. This is 10 mana to end up with a 3/4, a 3/3, and a 3/1.
---
If you already have the full sets, gold is better because you're saving for the next expansion.
---
From what I know there's 3 top classes with a fourth close contender. 
---
Mage warrior rogue are currently fighting each other for the top and hunter fighting right below them. 
---
I believe mage has the edge as the games are answer my turn 3 giant or die, followed by since you answered it I generate 13 random spells "if you survive you win"
---
Rogue is just a consistent pressure deck that can adjust itself midgame to counter the opponent dueto how many lackeys and spells it can discover. 
---
Warrior is a bear if it reaches turn 10. There's only 3 classes currently that cam end warrior before turn 10 through all its removal. Mage, rogue, and sometimes hunter. 
---
The current bar to get into this meta is not die to mages giantspamm while also somehow be able to kill a warrior before 10. The remaining classes aren't flexible enough.
---
Omega Devastator sits on your hand for all of your matches till turn 10. It's not so good against Rogue or Hunter either.
---
Linecracker, a 7 drop has to live for a turn with 5 or more HP.
---
So the enemy has to be able to do 6 damage, or have a silence, or have a taunt, or have a flat removal, or just kill you over the top.
---
It's funny how we see all these "blizzard plz" posts when the only time they were ever impactful was on deck slots, something we wished for for years.
---
Don't get your hopes up, nothing's coming
---
All that for a drop of blood
---
Wow, this is some next level tinfoil hat nonsense. Now a application that does nothing but translate data on your own PC is affecting matchups. What's next? My card back or wallpaper making me run into more Warriors?
---
Not really that crazy. It was 80 packs and I think I averaged about 1 legend in every 12. About the same as what was found to be average by Hearthstone Mathematics on YouTube.
---
Value matchups in wild.... Ouf that sounds rough LOL
---
Because tournament meta is different than ladder meta, that’s why.
---
I’m not mad at this brawl but it is just the dungeon run format slapped together with a few new bosses someone of which there was nothing really changed about. I am having fun though
---
I didnt talk about reveals. I talked about releases. I dont really need to know every card beforehand, I can live it with it being a surprise.
---
It works properly in the brawl, but I never took it in heist, so can't say there
---
Specialist format is a completely different meta from ladder. A lot of discussions here are relevant to Ladder.
---
I think Warrior is unplayable because the Mage sideboard auto beats it. Spirit of the Shark which is bad against everything except for Mage and Warrior is really good against Mage and Warrior, giving viability to Rogue.
---
Man, if you think /r/hearthstone is for weebs, I pray you never set foot in /r/shadowverse
---
*chuckles* 
---
I’m in danger
---
Pray for them to only have one minion, then hit the one you want to kill. It hits the poisonous boi, then dies
---
It is exceptionally smooth. Pretty widely regarded as a much prettier game than LoL. I am starting to think you havent even played Dota...

LOL, it's not smooth at all. The attack animations need a massive rework. Please, I've played 15 years of Dota, I know what I'm talking about.
---
It is by far aesthetically pleasing than LoL, which is exactly what I've been saying.
---
I'm just saying one oh these three subreddits has posts like 'AYA BLACKPAW SO T H I C C AYY LMAO 🐼🍑👅💦💦💦💦'. I mean no offense to actual weebs.
---
You can brag however much you like, but there's *no way* they're talking about picked winrate here. Aside from the fact that it says "generated..."
---
* The pickrates above are very consistent -- the class cards are about 3.5-4x more commonly generated than the neutral cards, even though zilliax is widely regarded to be much better than some of the other cards.
---
* Hecklebot is much worse when it's generated, since you can't pick or avoid it for the matchup. Its presence on this list *only* makes sense if we're talking about generated cards, otherwise it would be a great discover option when picked because you'd only pick it for the right matchups.
---
* Generation fills your hand, so having a 1 mana card is *not* terrible. Spark Drill fills your hand significantly worse than everything else.
---
* [We have the numbers for delivery drone](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/9lrj64/hsreplaynet_most_and_least_picked_mechs_from/), and they are nothing like the above stats, and Goblin Bomb has a higher winrate than Unpowered Steambot by 3%. It even has a higher winrate than weaponized pinata. These are old results, and delivery drone is not the same as early omega assembly, but there's no way to look at the Delivery Drone results and think what you have been saying.
---
You're just bitching about the results because you were wrong, and you're unwilling to accept it.
---
They should suspend next time, count only gameplay.
---
Is there a place to get the underlying data that feeds into this?
---
There was r/thehearth but i recall it wasn't very popular. If i have a deck idea, I would post it here.
---
Yeah. The bomb reads "you *take* 5 damage"
---
You aren't dealing anything
---
"41 minutes" is not a gameplay screenshot. Shit, that's closer to a meme than a gameplay screenshot.
---
Nerf this card. hOf brawl too
---
Not. Dust. Him. Not only for his value (probably he will be a staple in all Standard Druid decks for two years), but also because you don't know wich decks you will play in the next expansion or even in the last one of the year. I am not a Druid fan too but I began playing Token Druid because I found him in one of the first packs, so.. never say never :)
---
This article doesn't really go into much about identity at all and it's just really another promo for SoU.  
---
It will be interesting to see how some of the statements made pan out though like avoiding power creep (might want to look at Warrior there as it can only get worse if you don't do something about it) or avoiding quests feeling too much like an "I win" play or not worth it at all.  
---
Untapped potential and corrupt the waters already have me wondering.
---
clockwork giant op
---
It has to be, though. Could you imagine if it were good? We'd all be yelling about it.
---
Not to mention that by the point in the game Omega Assembly is played you USUALLY are in Boom Form, which means the rover has rush and so does the token.
---
DIE INSECT!
---
 I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Aya  Blackpaw. That perfect, curvy body. Those bountiful breasts. The child  bearing hips of a literal goddess. It honestly fucking hurts knowing  that I'll never mate with her, pass my genes through her, and have her  birth a set of perfect offspring. I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance  to get Aya Blackpaw pregnant. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I  can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would Blizzard  create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in  our faces?! Honestly guys, I just fucking can't anymore. Fuck.
---
[Oh look, more of it](https://i.imgur.com/BHzRF0U.gifv)
---
really bruh? really? commenting "why" without reading the post?
---
I don't think this is a mistake. Its nice that there's an easy button since its a good way for people to get resources.
---
For those who want a challenge, they can try Hagatha or Lazul. They don't all have to be the same or balanced. Think of it is an Easy, Medium, Hard mode.
---
So when you see a turn 7 linecracker you immediately waste everyhting on it because the opponent MIGHT be able to kill you? I'm sure that works out just fine
---
if this is satire it's very well done. i barely skimmed the text but i don't think i could make a more hilariously bad deck if i tried.
---
The first boss isn't hard for Shaman.  It's an easy blow out, 1 mana 2 use per turn Evolve is busted as hell if played correctly.
---
He should've been named Beta Devastator. That's a great name.
---
When heist first came out I took a few tries to do a run where the killing blow of each boss had to be an improvised explosive or bomb from deck
---
Seeing how powerful the warrior hero power is here, I'm now trying to do a run where 100% of face damage is from bombs alone
---
Who cares though? The card backs have no value. You can't sell them or trade them or whatever else.
---
And I say this as someone who has every card back possible apart from the ones you had to pay an absurd amount for (like huge set preorders) - I keep it on random anyway because I like 95% of the designs... And I definitely don't care about one of the designs being "less exclusive" now or what the fuck ever.
---
Change it's cost to 4 mana, change stats to 7/7 and maybe change the text to overload 2
---
Yeah, that could work. I’ll play around with the idea!
---
I’d give it 1 less health and 2 less cost to make it mediocre instead of complete shit.
---
Oh, I’m a moron. Misread the title and spent several minutes staring at the pic without getting it at all. My bad.
---
Too aggressive sucks, but to be so uninteractive as warrior is? That's so frustrating. Watching people throw down giant threat after giant threat only to be answered by one of Warriors seemingly infinite removal is absolutely dumb. 
---
Control warrior is literally so uninteractive that they have no idea what to do when I play spell Hunter for an OTK. I play nothing because I'm just waiting for Jepetto and they just sit there confused and not knowing what to do because they don't have any minions to use their cards on. I never feel as confident about a win as when I play this deck vs specifically control warrior.
---
...well shit 😂 that actually sounds like a very reasonable combo. It's only two cards, and the kill turn only requires you to spend 3 mana so you'll easily have the spare mana to silence or otherwise remove a taunt.
---
That's **actually** going to be a thing, isn't it?
---
Cool
---
That's not even remotely true. No need to throw slander out there because your post was removed 4 months ago.
---
No, I think Execute and Shield Slam are better. Omega Devastator is frustating because the best case scenario is excellent (turn 10 and with Dr. Boom) and Warrior can get 4-5 of them in long games. But it wasn't even two of for a while.
---
1 mana lol
---
Good cheap decks include Mid-range Hunter, Silence Priest, and Murloc Shaman. You can definitely climb and compete with those.  
---
Staple Legendaries include Zilliax, Leeroy Jenkins, and right now Blastmaster Boom is very very strong if you can manage a good Warrior deck (Bomb and Control are the two most popular Warrior decks)
---
The point of the subreddit is to be all inclusive of all hearthstone content while trying to appeal to as many users as possible. Right now memes are where we draw the line, that could change in the future.
---
Don't be a cunt mate, just giving my opinion on it.
