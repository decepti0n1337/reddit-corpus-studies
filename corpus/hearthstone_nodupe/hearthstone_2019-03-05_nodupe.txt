People who get butthurt in casual...
---

---
Why are you so insecure? It's casual? I played odd paladin in casual today, I destroyed my opponent who was playing Control Priest. Am I crying they played control priest against my tier 1 deck in casual? No. Because I just wanted to complete my quest quickly, and didn't want to play odd paladin in ranked because I think the meta right now is unfavourable.
---
Cry me a river. It's casual. If it pisses you off, concede and move on. That's the beauty of casual. It literally means nothing.
---
---
---
Deep sigh...

Firefly is quickly becoming one of my favorite cards. It's just so positive and generous. Practically costs nothing at all at one mana you drop him on the board and that chill ass motherfucker gives you  another 1/2 to use later in the game. And you also get this adorable little 1/2 can ping things but usually is too harmless to be removed.
---
But more than the FF is just so positive. It comes on the board like "Fwhoosh!" and I'm like "yeah FF let's woosh" and when he attacks he's like "Fwuhhh!" and I'm like "yeah they are SO Fwuhh!" He doesn't say some bullshit macho shit like "I will destroy you" he's just like "nah fhwuush." And it looks so happy. I mean this is an inanimate insect literally brought to life by magic. It understands it's life is a temporary magical gift and the dude is just fucking loving it.¬†[I mean look at his face he's just so happy.](https://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/335/100/55466.png)
---
I am literally never sad when Firefly is on board. IDK if he's gonna make it into the metagame or not but for now he (or she) a pretty chill card
---
How the hell does saying ThatsAdmirable bit about free stamps for ice cream evolve into this.
---
Vilespine Slayer?

English bro
---
Not sure why you think Fire Fly is better designed than the other offenders like Zilliax and Sludge Belcher. You can fit it into almost deck that isn't hard control. 
---
I think a 1/2 ‚Äúadd a 1/1 mech to your hand with magnetic‚Äù would be good
---
Alley Cat was a really good 1-drop, too. Always felt fine, just a nice, solid drop.
---
summon al' alkir 
---
And then they have some broken board clear cards. 
---
I love this card, especially in arena. It gives me insight into what kind of deck they drafted or their mindset. Example: a person chose holy smite over squashlings and baffled me
---
&gt;When a tribal synergy card is sees heavy play without any additional support, that's a red flag.
---
Fire Fly sees play in mostly non-Elemental themed decks. But Fire Fly is a great designed card? 
---
What cards are going to be switched to wild? Can someone please link me a list? 
---
Love this card, works so well with my sac pack üòç
---
&gt; This is the point right before the rotation where everyone decides to jerk off all of the ridiculously powerful cards by calling them ‚Äúwell-designed‚Äù.
---
Well-designed cards are allowed to be rotated, you know. It doesn't matter how well-designed a card is. If it sees play, it's going to get boring after long enough.
---
&gt; Cards like Fire Fly, Keleseth, Tar Creeper, Azure Drake, Stonehill, Chain Gang, prenerf Bonemare, and yes, Zilliax, that are just so much better than other options in their mana slot lead to a more boring game, where 35% of decks are running the exact same 10 card neutral package.
---
You really, *really* shouldn't be lumping all of those cards together.
---
Keleseth is polarising based on draw. That's already bad.
---
Azure Drake was extremely versatile, where sometimes the Dragon Tribal or Spell Damage mattered. It wasn't broken, but it was too versatile making it too ubiquitous, so its rotation out was healthy. I have no problem with Azure Drake's design, nor do I have a problem with its rotation.
---
Saronite Chain Gang following its nerf sees play in 5.5% of decks. That's healthy.
---
I'll give you Tar Creeper.
---
Stonehill Defender, while as popular/strong as Tar Creeper (21.4% to Stonehill compared to 23.8% to Tar Creeper) is a lot less boring, because it utilises the Discover effect and has a degree of variance to it. Not only this, but Stonehill power relies also on other cards in the rotation. Stonehill in Odd Paladin is largely so appealing thanks to the amazing class Taunts that Paladin has (Righteous Protector, Tarim, Tirion).
---
I'll give you pre-nerf Bonemare.
---
I'll give you Zilliax on account of just being *that good,* but boring? Eh. Zilliax is fine in its current state, I am just concerned about it next rotation.
---
Now... Fire Fly.
---
Fire Fly is better than any one of those by design. Better than Zilliax because, unlike Zilliax, there are different reasons you may play Fire Fly. Fire Fly can be useful for Tokens for Odd Paladin, it can be useful for Combo activations for Rogue, it can be useful for Elemental synergy in Shaman (or Mage), and it can be useful for hand size retention in (Book of Spectres) Mage as well.
---
There are a ton of decks running Zilliax that don't care about the Mech or Magnetic, only the rest of the card. And Zilliax is by far the most popular card in the game as it stands.
---
Point being, Fire Fly was good for synergy, not just good by itself. It was decent by itself, but its popularity is not just because it's "technically" a 2 Mana 2/4.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs possible to like a card‚Äôs flavor or enjoy playinga specific card while still conceding that it was probably a little overtuned.
---
I wouldn't change Fire Fly at all. With Zilliax, the only "satisfying" nerf is making it cost (1) more Mana, but that's a *big* nerf that doesn't need to happen right now, because Zilliax feels A-okay to play against.
---
I'll piggyback on this seeing as how the comment was deleted, but I want other people to read this to have a better understanding.
---
If like that person said, we should respect someone trying to complete a quest, then I would like all my opponents to just concede against me as I am trying to complete my own quest as quickly as possible. I don't want to play odd pally in casual, but I really wanna get my win 1 paladin game quest complete ASAP. So please, from now on, if you see me running Odd Pally in casual, just surrender and respect that I am trying to complete a quest. /s
---
See. this is why this mentality is really... dumb.
---
It's casual. People can/will play whatever they want, and you know what. That's just casual. Deal with it or go find another game if you are too sensitive.
---
My elemental Mage will miss you deeply

---
Millhouse + Cryostasis gets close, but it will never fill the hole it left in my heart when it left standard.
---
For once I agree with OP. Well said.
---
I was referencing the Modern format due to how it went from being just another format to being an important format that players need to master if they intend to compete on an international level. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The Wild format will most likely be incorporated in Hearthstone tournaments when its meta game differs exponentially from that of Standard both in terms of power and style.
---
I agree, though people did take issue with it because it was very difficult to fully remove in time for Crackling Razormaw to drop down.
---
mikemage#2310 EU, 80g quest trade, I'll show and you go first.
---
They do fix these, either by giving a coin or reducing mana cost. There is one with Equality still at 2.
---
Only when it goes face though! SMOrc
---
That's weird. They said all the cards in these puzzles were snapshot-ed so so they wouldn't change with card changes. 
---
This, having strong neutral cards dilutes the identity of decks, and in turn cause all games to play out the same way.  You can have strong neutral cards, but have them be more niche that fit in very precise deck archetypes., ones that showcase the strength of class identities not overwhelm them.
---
It also allowed for smoothing out curves for odd decks.  And gave many decks a 1-drop that was better than passing the turn, but had more value than the average 1 drop.  It also gave cheap bodies for Funglemancer.  It also provided Flame Elementals as a quest completion option for some quest rogues.  It also gave big spell mages flexibility to combine with their pings in early turns to remove key targets.  It also provided token druid with cheap minions to setup Savage Roar and buffs.  It also provided Shaman to setup Bloodlust turns cheaply and Hagatha/Shudderwock value (on top of the aforementioned elemental activator).  It provided paladins with cheap buff targets.
---
It was extremely versatile.
---
Magic the Gathering *Arena*, yes. Hearthstone is still nothing compared to MTG as a whole. 
---
If you understood how blizzard has evolved in the last 20 years you'd realize that's the exact opposite direction they are trying to go. I like to use the term strategic depth to describe this, and that's something Blizzard tries to stay away from so they can draw in more of the laymen. 
---
Springpaw is fun, too.
---
Aggro shaman before LOE got rotated was so incredibly broken because of this card, finley, and tunnel trogg
---
Those three pirates?

Lee, Lifeson and Peart
---
It's *possible* it comes out in late April.  Or they finally have the technology to do World's on a past patch.

All I know is that the set won't launch before April 3rd.  Anytime after is fair game.
---
That ball theorem fucks my brain
---
Gosh, one more month of this current meta...
---
Yeah man. Rad synergy with Toxmonger, Timber Wolf, and Scavenging Hyena.
---
For referance for people who dont understand, r/AskOuija
---
Throw in a lot of hyperbole, words like cool, awesome, fun and exciting and you got a text book Mike Donnais interview
---
picked a random asian. thanks SNJing
---
That truth only reinforces the validity of the problem though. The game should be about reacting to what your opponent does with their cards, not about knowing whether you'll win or lose from the get-go because both you and your opponent know all 30 cards in each-others decks and know their win condition.
---
Hyena is straight cancer though with this current meta
---
The actual reference is r/477
---
Y'Shaarj and Finja are both basically Recruit effects from when before Recruit was a thing.
---
Dr Boom and Zuljin arent
---
I was watching American Dad just before voting and thankfully it influenced my choice, POG!
---
N'Zoth's First Mate is quickly becoming one of my favorite cards. (...) That chill ass motherfucker gives you a weapon to buff later in the game. And you also get this additional adorable little 1/1 that's **in charge now!**
---
If they decided to do something like that, newer players would have a hard time even building a single deck as the classic set makes up a decent portion of beginner cards, let alone an efficient ranked deck.
---
Oh yeah I think Scavenging Hyena could be safely nerfed to gain +1/+1 when a friendly Beast dies and it would still be really strong. 
---
Poor Fire Fly, just like the TV show we all lived you so much and you were taken from us too soon.
---
This should be a copypasta
---
About how fun would he say spells are?
---
Whelp, RIP this sub for a while
---
Melisma#1343 NA. Looking for quick quest trade. 
---
But as it is now, new players make good classic cards and they get rotated anyway with the HoF
---
Im glad its rotating but its a fun card. I will miss it.
---
Keleseth was pretty busted. Yeah, no 2 drops is a big cost, but so is a deck with all odd cards. Except in both cases it became apparent it wasn't as big a cost as we thought, and the potential upside was simply better than most of the 2 drops we had available in the last couple years. It wasn't like there were only one or two decks that could use Keleseth. The guy has been slotted into decks of almost every class, from Shudderwock Shaman to Zoolock, to Recruit Hunter. It got to a point where printing new 2 drops like Vulgar Homunculus didn't matter, because there was no way it was gonna be played over Keleseth at the time.
---
And, like you said, he's crazy swingy. Things have settled down a bit, but for quite a while we had a meta where large percentages of games were determined by whether or not you drew Keleseth. He's in your opening hand? Yeah you've just won 9 times out of 10. That's not healthy.
---
Let him have his moment of unadultered happiness lol
---
Look at this fat cat with golden yeti. Why don't you share your ~~lentils~~ exp with the rest of us?
---
Yeah I was gonna say OP is jumping the gun more than a fair bit. For as powerful as Deathstalker Rexxar was, playing him was sheer awesome sauce.
---
This really helps the metre
---
I never understood why you‚Äôd want to play even with pirates. The best pirate support, south sea captain, can‚Äôt be played at all. Can‚Äôt play boarding party or any removal aside from walk the plank. Just doesn‚Äôt seem worth it to have a 1 cost dagger all game. 
---
Actually the only name i knew from the list, as the funny guy who was in a random Zalae video. First time i've got more than the 1 consolation pack so hurray!
---
Good night ;(
---
You play the normal good rogue stuff like Prep, Backstab etc. and your 2-drops synergize greatly with the 1-mana dagger.  I was hyped for it before the expansion, until I saw Raiding Party that pretty much killed the idea.
---
He's called Chillwind Yeti, give him some Frozen synergy. Gains +1/+1 or +2/+2 if a minion is frozen.
---
Well said. I wrote up a [pls nerf all the things](https://www.hearthpwn.com/forums/hearthstone-general/card-discussion/81460-balancing-dominant-cards) thread back around that time (tgt?) for similar reasons. I got my wish! 
---
 It's a game dude.
---
One of the benefits of shaman's upgraded hero power is that they get to ignore this restriction. 
---
I levelled an eu account so I could use it for eu tournaments and have another place to get legend. Almost my entire climb through sub-25 ranks was against bots with the same decks. Made it pretty boring to climb. Must be selling fresh accounts with x amount of gold.
---
Yea but during that time hunter was trash so it was never really an issue. 
---
The deep sigh at the start was the best part!
---
Activision literally made cuts because they weren't maximizing revenue to shareholder expectations. 
---
It won't be cheaper and worse, now they're going to try to sell us all Solo content again on top of it.

---
Do you actually think they would delay releasing an expansion due to Htc scheduling?  
---
Isnt part of the impact because it was basically the first card to force every single deck to run some type of tech and removal for it?
---
that deck was the first to consistently end the game by turn 4 unless you had instant removal. It stopped being useful only after the entire ladder reacted to it.
---
*Genn
---
Cubing grizzly and playing play dead after that felt disgusting 
---
Honestly, I'm in favor of almost any suggestion that would make this game cheaper and/or add more features. Your specific idea is cool too.
---
That doesn‚Äôt somehow make it not a valid point. 
---
This would be nice. A mid range deck that isn't just a fancy aggro deck paired with a "control-in-a-card" strat like hunter has would be fun. Paladin outside of aggro is one of my favorite classes.
---
Absolutely insane how overpowered that entire expansion was. Hell even the cards people thought were gonna be bad like [[To My Side!]] were powerfull.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind drawing dad, I wish he would hurry up and buy those cigarettes already

Yes, and you keep the cards. When they are rotated you get 3200 dust
---
Ironwood Golem is not neutral, and Witchwood Grizzly is not what people typically refer to when it comes to Neutral Taunts. Really, only two decks have been able to really use Witchwood Grizzly at all.
---
He won‚Äôt burn anything if he uses his remaining 5 mana to play... anything
---
&gt; UI feels awful to play against. As an opponent you do everything you should, control the board, out value your opponent, get them low on cards in hand.... and then they top deck UI, clear your minion, heal themselves, drop a 5/5, and refill their hand.
---
That's really not how I felt playing against it.
---
Usually I felt like...ok, they killed one minion; if I was playing an aggro deck, usually I killed them the next turn.  If I was playing a combo or control deck, mostly I'm worried about the card draw, all the other effects are pretty minor.
---
&gt; In addition, win rates fluctuate greatly over time. Obviously a 10 mana card is going to be worse when both mana ramp cards just got nerfed. Nobody was complaining about those two cards being OP before UI was printed.
---
They kind-of don't though.  If you remember back when Innervate was nerfed they commented on UI with their own internal statistics, and said it was a pretty middle-of-the-road for winrate in the deck.  Far from the best card in the deck, but far from the worst card in the deck too.

It's so bizarre to me that this is a problem for enough people that Blizzard has to go out of their way to address it.
---
On the other side of this, whatever you played on turn 4 that required your opponent to use his coin and Vilespine must be pretty broken.
---
But will she get something to grant wings?
---
Because it wins less than 40% of the time as it's easy to end up with a bad hand early on.
---
If this became a popular deck, couldn't the opponent counter it by not playing multiple/any minions? That was the flaw I saw with gonk decks

No...just no.  There‚Äôs like a million reasons why this is not a good argument but I‚Äôll give you the best two.

Spell Hunter was absolutely a t1-t2 deck pre-Rastakhan's.

done with Blkced#1805
---
No, spell hunter with to my side became a thing when Barnes rotated out, because the Yshaarj Barnes combo went to wild.
---
Throughout Year of the Raven Spell Hunter was a powerful deck due to a lot of decks that beat it disappearing and most of the cards being from year of the mammoth, so it was fully formed without any aid from the new sets.

I guess next one will be Pirate Mage.

Start watching some streamers, or watch youtube videos of them. 
---
Firebat and Zalae come to mind, as they explain literally everything they're doing.
---
Learning to handtrack is a good thing, too, but only really helps, when you know what you're up against. 
---
Other than that: learn the meta, keep tech cards in mind, learn to play around certain cards, do NOT overcommit.
---
Gotcha. I should craft prep. Thanks
---
I run floop in my mechathun. Usually I use it for an extra auctioneer/wild pyro/acolyte of pain but it can be used to make a 3/4 mechathun you can kill with wrath + moonfire
---
Hearthstone needs to take some ideas from duel masters.
---
No no no. It's [[Budapest Okra]].
---
Un‚ÄôGoro was easily my favorite meta. Quests were cool, the game was statistically balanced, and every single class was viable in differing and interesting ways (....well, except Warlock.)
---
I‚Äôll be sad to see it go, but the expansions that followed power creeped it way beyond that initial, awesome first two months or so.
---
Second place is maybe Mean Streets of Gadgetzan, even though it was objectively problematic. I just loved the tri class theme. 
---
As someone who recently got into ranked play as a f2p player, craft ultra aggressive decks. Face Hunter with deathstalker rexxar as the only legendary can be tons of fun and can climb. 
---
The only thing that'll change would be that Druid would get significantly weaker and mechathun druid being non existent and warlock having half their decks become wake as well
---
I don't think this card was too strong, especially with 3 mana 4/2 kill this fucker back then.
---
"Laugh in Wild"
---
Maybe the right word he was looking for is token class? As in make lots of small guys and buff them to win (savage roar, bloodlust, silver sword, etc.). 
---
It‚Äôs the perfect team game.
---
Wouldn't it make more sense to make the announcement before the AMA, so people have a chance to ask questions in the AMA thread?

---
How important is King Mukla in the Egg Paladin?
---
Is this guy doing another season of Sherlock or what?
---
You may be joking but I think "Handbuff"-Lock will probably be a strong archetype next X-Pac. They already printed a few cards for this, wouldn't be surprised if they made a few more and make it really viable with Hir'eek being one win condition if you can flood the board with 5/5s (or higher) copies at a point of the game where the opponent lacks hard board clears.
---
I was thinking Vitus the Exiled. I've only beaten him once or twice. Gnomenapper I've beaten... I think 3/4ths of the times I've faced him. I don't think of him as a particularly strong boss, at least not compared to Vitus and Azalina.

Yeah TJ and Admirable are a great pair, but for a casual event or an Invitational.  I would much rather Raven/Sottle or Frodan/Kibler for serious competitive games imo.
---
Best caster of all time is still Firebat though.  I wish they got him back more often.
---
Best warlock in the year of the Dragon confirmed !
---
And Doomguard, Naturalize and Divine Favor.
---
how do i check?
---
As a 6 mana 6/7, this would still be a pretty bad card, and freeze shaman would still be bad. 
---
As a 6 mana 8/8, this would be a pretty good card, but freeze shaman would still be pretty bad. 
---
I imagine there must be a pile of unreleased freeze shaman cards that justified this statline, because otherwise it should have been obviously changed before release.

---
You can climb with it, but it's just long journey. Also the fact that it's a fun deck that actually requires skill to manage and use Espionage.
---
In the official blog post about Year of the Dragon, they state that the solo content will be coming out a month after the expansion launches, and that it will be first available to play in May. So April is a definite.
---
Well, no. 3/5 of my former "team" that I was playing with doesn't give a thing about competitive scene. Also I met a lot of cool people through the CS:GO and 30-35% that I talked to for more than 5 minutes doesn't care about it too. But at least almost anyone knows when are the majors.
---
BTW, "vast majority"? HS is a casual game that had a lot of players that are not "gamers" per se. They don't know Toast, Thijs etc. and they couldn't care less.

What this gentleman means is that cards from the Journey to Un'Goro, Knights of the Frozen Throne, and Kobolds and Catacombs expansions will be rotating into wild format, along with Baku the Mooneater, Genn Greymane, and any cards relating to Odd or Even decks. (and some other stuff that doesn't jump to mind.)
---
I am vehemently against reprints but in favor of reusing cards.
---
Uh, both of those cards are played in what tempo storm calls the strongest deck in wild.

No, you are right.  They do ban waves but they also do individual bans too based on reports.  They just typically ban all at once to mask the reason the bot was detected.

---
I totally agree, I think I wrote something like that on the Zilliax tribute post yesterday. I mean if people just want more of this kind of neutral card we'll end up with top tier decks filled with 90% of neutral cards. Spiteful summoner decks for everyone, replace your ultimate infestation by a mind control or a pyroblast and here you go, same deck! That's not a good way to design a game with 9 classes, neutral cards should be a toolbox depending on the deck you're building, not a list of cards that you must include in most archetypes and most classes.
---
:o nice tips
---
Literally the worst designed card in the entire game...   
---
I hope they never make this mistake again  
---
What about Illidan then?
---
Second time getting 4 packs. Woohoo.
---
Undertaker in Naxx would like to have a word with you.
---
You have to consider what a person could instead be doing for 1, 2, or 3 mana. 1 drops that are actually played are almost universally either 1/2 or 2/1 with the 2/1's having an upside, 2 drops are almost universally 2/3 or 3/2 with additional upsides, and 3 drops are either very good 3/3's or 3/4's / 4/3's with upsides. No one would ever play a 3 mana 3/3 in their deck or frankly even a vanilla 3 mana 3/4 (exception of course being the All minion for tribal synergies, which means it isn't exactly vanilla).
---
So, yes, you curve out 3 turns but at no point are you overwhelming the board or your opponent. Aggro can do so so so much better and don't need to care about card advantage if your opponent is dying quickly.
---
I stand by it as not being overpowered, merely efficient.
---
Very disappointed with how this game has turned out overall but definitely agree with this post. Well designed balanced, strong card, not game winning, and not unfun to play against. 
---
Same thing. You can do this for just about any card. I don't really care for buffs. Why would I want to see a buff for Illidan when all it means is that I'll see *more* Illidan?
---
If you ask me to nerf Zilliax, or Master's Call, or Crackling Razormaw, *then* we're talking, because I don't know what takes over after that.
---
What the f is this card ?
---
I wish there were more micro-metas in Hearthstone. Old Adventures added a couple of cards each week and people would experiment and the next cards would be added before the experimenting was 100% over. With a new set you get a max of 1 week experimentation aswell and then the meta gets more stale each day.
---
Oooof.
---
Thanks tho'
---
Are you new to this sub? Today is tribute Tuesday.  Tomorrow will be pull your dicks out for Brode Wednesday. 
---
Work shifts and earn real money.
---
I would enjoy seeing them adopt the approach Eternal CCG has used a few times, which is to give small buffs to "just for fun" decks to make them less awful without disrupting competitive play.
---
I mean, if we are talking about buffing one or two cards then yes, your point might be correct (but then newly buffed card can spawn new deck that uses other underperforming cards thus giving them second life).
---
But there are so many useless cards (about half of card pool) that Blizzard can just make entire expansion out of buffed old cards that noone ever played and game will feel fresh.
---
If the basic set is too strong you are forced to make new card stronger or they'll never see play. Druid isn't the only class getting the basic set nerf treatment.
---
That would be 1k gold. I don't know if I can afford that luxury. I feel as if any gold I spend these days is better spent on the upcoming expansion.
---
If the card is unplayable, buff it. Don't screw over new and F2P players by leaving basic cards unplayable and replacing them with power creeped Legendaries.
---
Well, if you say so. *unzips* Ben?
---
&gt; You have to consider what a person could instead be doing for 1, 2, or 3 mana. 
---
If you care so much about tempo.
---
But this is a value generator *and* a curve fill-out.
---
&gt; No one would ever play a 3 mana 3/3 in their deck or frankly even a vanilla 3 mana 3/4
---
And they wouldn't play a 1/1 either, but they do if it adds more resources to your hand.
---
&gt; So, yes, you curve out 3 turns but at no point are you overwhelming the board or your opponent. 
---
And? I never said you would be overwhelming the board. Of course you're not "overwhelming" it. That doesn't change the fact that you're getting three turns worth of plays out in a single card.
---
You know what other card does that? Pyros.
---
&gt; Aggro can do so so so much better and don't need to care about card advantage if your opponent is dying quickly.
---
Except this card is a solid Aggro card because it lets you fill out your curve and is a far better top deck than just about *any* other one-drop.
---
&gt; I stand by it as not being overpowered, merely efficient.
---
It's not efficient, it's just chock-block full of value. And for no reason other than pissing people off when you get to play it on Turn 1 so the opponent knows your next two turns are sorted. Because you either have nothing and play the additional tokens, or you have something and have even better tempo.
---
It's awful design.
---
[removed]
---
Damn this time i finally picked what people on reddit and pros endorsed and actually got more than one pack! Thx bunnyhoppor
---
Right so you just want to see War Golem and Ironbark Protector seeing play every year, do you?
---
No thanks. Low-budget players aren't going to stick around if they're playing the same cards all the time. The exact same can be said for high-budget players who are fiddling around with their playable Basic and Classic cards and not anything new.
---
There is no 13 mana minion in the game it can transform into.
---
and almost all of them are class cards 
---
&gt; (but then newly buffed card can spawn new deck that uses other underperforming cards thus giving them second life).
---
New cards and card nerfs can achieve this exact same effect. As much flak as Baku gets, it gave rise to Stormwind Champion and Raid Leader.
---
&gt; But there are so many useless cards (about half of card pool) that Blizzard can just make entire expansion out of buffed old cards that noone ever played and game will feel fresh.
---
No, because then the game is just about *that* buffed half (now a third) of the card pool.
---
You will never, *ever* have this pristine meta where out of the hundreds of cards (810 from 6 card sets, plus Classic and Basic) in the Standard rotation, even half of them will see play at any one time. It's a pipe dream.
---
Those look like 2 opinons, not really a lot.
---
Why does this sub even have mods lmao
---
Yeah Raza took a while to evolve from "grindy attrition" to "I'm going to draw through my deck and otk you."
---
Upset me when it did because I didn't have Velen and I enjoy slow grindy playstyles.
---
I disagree with your assessment that aggro just puts in various early game threats without much planning. Because aggro has a much smaller window of opportunity, every small decision matters, even in card choice. You only draw 5 to 8 cards, so you have to choose them wisely. The value of an aggro deck is measured in tempo and damage output, and the minions and spells selected must have the highest cost to value ratio to have a fighting chance. You dont get to play all cards, so you have to make sure that your cards are not dead draws and that they all serve their purpose.
---
It‚Äôs pretty incredible how Team 5 managed to take a *great, fun* solo mode and completely neuter/kill any of my excitement for it or future modes in three expansions flat. 
---
Dungeon Run was cool, and it was fun. Monster Hunt was less cool, and less fun. Rumble Run was (somehow) even less cool and less fun. 
---
Only Team 5 could latch on to a good idea and kill it this quickly.
---
But whatever, at least we get to *pay for it* this fourth time! 
---
Hallo?
---
Or maybe "whenever a minion is frozen, add a copy of it to your Hand" 
---
Shaman with blazecallers already in your collection isn‚Äôt a bad idea. Right now shaman is basically elemental/shudderwock shaman but I‚Äôm not quite sure how much will rotate out. Either way one of the few epics is blazecaller. 
---
I'm a faithless individual :)
---
I'll wait for groups and decklists to choose.  /r/competitiveHS usually has a good discussion before these events that will usually get you out of groups.
---
The Spoopy part is what always gets me!
---
because they repost all the jokes here?
---
ok.. Is that not allowed?
---
Awesome dude. Did you get lucky with a burgle and find a duplicate spell? 
---
I‚Äôm struggling on Rumble Run, with rogue, because I can‚Äôt find any healing and near boss 6/7/8 just get crushed by cheap combos
---
Divine shield paladin with blood knight has a 9/9 on turn 3, then proceeds to buff him up to like 16 attack. Then puts out a taunt minion who can only take 1 damage at a time, there‚Äôs no coming back from this without assassinates or walk the planks and I just didn‚Äôt have them 
---
I think it was supposed to create crazy board tension.  Like I better kill this or they will be able to UI me for free on T7.  It might have started off one sided and been too powerful.
---
The nerf has completely crushed the deck's ability to sustain while sitting down playing solitaire. I'm finding more success in the Control Paladin variants that play for the board with an alternate win condition without going full combo, like the Hakkar/Liam version.
---
nothing, I have opened both as well, however Celestia was the last legendary and I overall got all the good ones from the packs so I'm not complaining. I will use it in wild in ~3 years and people will be soo confused.
---
unfortunately I really don't see zoolock being a thing after this rotation. It probably had a good chance of seeing play, but doomguard gone will totally kill that deck. They'll need some serious support
---
Such as?
---
I think they're more flexible with class archetypes for expansions vs. the classic set. Warlock being a handbuff class for a year and a bit is OK, but it would be a different story if Hireek was in their classic set.
---
What does face collector do? I forgot. Someone here said he uses your deck, how?
---
I didnt use combos. The 2 shrine was just another win condition. I have deathrattles, vilespines( take them, they are too useful to ignore) and some control tools like vanish, etc...
---
Try to maximise your card usage instead of concentrating on one win condition. Hope it helps!
---
Why would Aggro use Ziliax over Leroy?
---
Are you complaining about cards that aren't even released yet?
---
Moorabai's ability doesn't work on himself, that would make him OP! /s 
---
i own both.
---
This is kinda stupid.
---
It‚Äôs a vanilla minion. Of course it‚Äôs well balanced, Yeti‚Äôs job is to mark the ‚Äòmidpoint‚Äô (read: balanced) stats for a 4 mana minion.
---
Of all the cards you could have circlejerked, this is perhaps the most boring. 
---
Thats how it should be, printing useless epic cards just to get more money from packs is worse imo
---
A surprise, to be sure.
---
Ziliax is a well designed card but similar cards should be printed in moderation. The amount of healing it grants against Aggro is simply too substantial to consider printing more of the same kind.
---
Lol the irony rivals the idiocy in this one.
---
Pretty much only priest players are going to miss that ridiculous card.
---
It'd be a 2 card, 9 mana combo with nova which gives you a 4/4 and some dudes in hand. Next turn the dudes are still there and for it to be "good" there have to be a lot/powerful minions for you to freeze. Which means you're losing. Because they have dudes and you have a 4/4. Moorabi is garbage and not because he's in shaman.
---
He's a 3 mana 4/1 "Your volume can't be reduced below maximum." and wears flannel.
---
https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/File:Ben_Brode(701).png
---
Lower stats than Magma Rager but that booming voice is worth it
---
That deck was the best priest deck ever. DK anduin and Raza ruined priest and its never been fun after that for me. 
---
But this is the Future of new players 
---
what about [[frozen crusher]]? its a 6/8/8 minion that freezes itself once it attacks. i would say its a decent at the deck of yours.
---
I occasionally see Zoolock in wild that runs him, also saw a weird Hunter deck that ran him once or twice. He's not a common play, but he's definitely not gone for good 
---
I tried but unfortunately he‚Äôs dead

6/8/8 Elemental | After this minion attacks, Freeze it.  
---
Is this the secret to open good packs?
---
hug druid is a fun meme. honestly almost as playable as moorabi shaman
---
People were jerking HARD on this one. I remember people outraged that minion-less hunter wasn't hunter , and besides the multiple summon cards I was super digging the "solo hunter vibe".
---
  
---
Besides, Call of the Wild was OP at 9 mana and I saw time and time again people criticizing To My Side for being too expensive at 6 mana.
---
...not!
---
Pity
---
Well you can‚Äôt in standard, alarm o bot is wild, but you seem to be missing the point regardless. If you bring it on to the board free at the start of your turn, YOU get to be the first one to play a card for 0. Presumably you‚Äôve built your deck around this concept, and your opponent has not. And you can also silence her by the end of your turn if you feel the need. 
---
There aren‚Äôt cards to make this viable now, but they could be printed. 
---
You do get something: the last golden hero.
---
You can't do quests without top tier competitive decks?
---
&gt; Hopefully they will address that at some point in the future.
---
I doubt it.
---
And then you drew vile spine, bone are and Lich King for the concede. 
---
I want to see majordomo into rag+Amara+thekal+another Amara. 
---
I am so used to getting far into arena, that I actually feel offended when my first opponent gives me a good fight or actually beats me. Those are supposed to be freebies!
---
Then you realize that you could just as likely have faced another infinite player. 0-0 games can be spicy.
---
You have some really weird opinions on card design.
---
Dope!
---
I got harbinger celestia :(
---
It really doesn‚Äôt though. It‚Äôs a 4 mana mirror entity, that also isn‚Äôt a secret. That‚Äôs never, ever good. 
---
Ah the memories - neptulon was so cool and that intro animation üòòüëå
---
Yep. I‚Äôm one such person. As a new player it‚Äôs a bit hard to get a decent collection going so I‚Äôd rather pay $10 for 9000 gold, dust, free golden cards collected from previous events along with  62 packs already on there to kick start myself and have a meta deck as opposed to making a new account and spendings months trying to get there myself. I know it‚Äôs not ‚Äòethical‚Äô but Hearthstone really is a bore if you‚Äôre just starting out and have no resources. 
---
Most of them are dust now lol. Yeah i had to craft most of the good legendarys since i'm a semi-free-to-player player.
---
No, that goes directly against one of the fundamental aspects the game was designed around and which played a major part in the game's success.
---
I think there's room for Secrets to become more adaptable to compensate, but there's no way they'd ever allow players to simply cast spells or even select targets on their opponents turn, and that's not a bad thing at all.
---
No. The game isn't designed around doing anything on your opponents turn. Most people are probably afk waiting for their opponent to quit being slow. 
---
Warlocks mains get to retire to wild. 
---
Have it already!
---
Control vs control is just as draw dependent as aggro vs aggro, you just don't see that because it's spread over time. 
---
Thanks
---
I think Jaraxxuss might make a return. Especially since the Death knights will also rotate out.
---
So many salty people in here. I played rexxar when odd paladin was THE DECK that was being played. The only way to counter their turn 6 tarim was getting rexxar since hunter has no aoe besides hounds. Also the only way to beat zoolock. It was anti aggro
---
It was also great against control since you keep getting either a strong beast or a small taunt or whatever you made. Lifesteal cards were hard to find but when you did boy did they carry me. 
---
Ungoro was the first expansion ive pre ordered and will definitely miss it as well since i love kalimos and jaina
---
Based on the nerf to flametongue, a board centric aggro or midrange archetype of some sort is probably in the works.
---
Probably just a trait. Seems pretty evenly split. 
---
I would concede too, against a cube hunter.
---
Cheers to you for playing a tier 1, HCT dominating, copy and pasted deck. 
---
Youre great!
---
**Battlecry:** summon patient assassin.
---
The poster child for the idea that some cards should be buffed.
---
After a few months they probably saw that noone is putting this in their decks...they could have given him +1/+2 or +2/+2 or added more support cards... instead they went "oh well some cards suck, what are you gonna do".
---
I have a normal Moorabi and a golden Temporus. I haven't brought myself to disenchant either of them. 
---
Innkeeper.exe has stopped working
---
Yup, at least Moorabi doesn't instantly lose you the game when you play it. 
---
Might as well have named her Duskfallen Millhouse Manastorm
---
Were you not there for Implosion, Imp Gang Boss, Darkshire Councilman, Power Overwhelming, Nerubian Egg, Haunted Creeper, etc.
---
Warlock has been a token class from the very beginning. 
---
Laughs in Doomguard
---
If you can point to an optimized Maly Rogue list I'll gladly give it a shot... I tried making my own list just because I know it's godly against Priests (When Razakus was all over Wild and before they rotated Conceal I had like 85% winrate against Priest using Miracle Rogue) but in Standard it feels gimmick and lackluster... As for Pirate Rogue,I know it's decent,but I despise the Deck as much as Priests so it's not something I'd ever take into consideration,thanks for trying to be helpful though.... 
---
At least with duskfallen aviana, the card was interesting and had the potential of being breakable. The sheer power that could be accessed if it could survive was great, I was waiting for someone to sort it out and get it usable.
---
Moorabi had no potential. It's benefit isn't even that great, especially in a class that already has tons of way to clog your hands with other random stuff.
---
Year of the raven cards aren't rotating, year of the mammoth cards are.
---
Whoops, I am sorry. I did not realize. Is it alright if I repost this with a title that doesn't have "curse words"?
---
It can happen sure, but it's rare enough. At the same time it might summon Doomsayer, probably instant win against rez priest which what this is a tech against.
---
WTF? If you're undercutting that then you're strawmanning or something. Why would you have any reason to undercut that? You're totally neglecting the core reason why somebody would pick April 2nd which is it being right after the login bonus period. Let's assume that, without taking into account the login bonus, it's just as likely to be a tuesday or Thursday, but so what? Who said otherwise? Is there some Thursday that has anything supporting it that is comparable to end of the login bonus period? IMO there is no single Thursday (nor any other Tuesday or any other day of the week) that is as likely as April 2nd. Do you disagree with that? If not then I don't get your point.  
---
April 2nd *is* currently the best candidate for release date. It doesn't mean it will definitely happen then, nor does it mean it'll be on a Tuesday. However it being a Tuesday does help support the date, just compare it to if blizzard did actually mean mean midnight the way you understood it. April 3rd being a Wednesday would be something that goes against it being the release date and I think that would counteract it being the end of the login bonus period.
---
Lol, someone is playing murloc druid and isn't getting rank 10.

\# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
The salt is real.
---
&gt; My bad, I literally just whiffed past the card and point, so my arguments for it kinda moot, but ty for thinking about it. sorry to waste you time
---
Ahaha no problem, I understand what you meant now that I see you were talking about Grand Archivist.
---
It goes without saying that Grand Archivist pushed such a deck design *along with Spiteful Summoner.*
---
But yeah, they both forced that deck type a lot.
---
&gt; 3) on the warsong thing I get that it was problematic, but wish they found a way for patron to exist without its burst, like if when a minion goes over 3 attack it loses the charge or such, so you an patron a board, but not burst for 100+ dmg
---
Two ways to do it:
---
1. Make Warsong Commander an Aura effect, so it reads "Your minions with 3 or less Attack have **Charge.**" 
---
2. Make Warsong Commander give **Rush.**
---
&gt; especially since wild is a bit of a "dumping grounds" where stuff can and maybe even should be op by standard's standards (lol)
---
Yeah Wild is trying to satisfy both Eternal formats for MTG: Legacy and Vintage (unless I whiffed the names). And it can't. It can't let you play all the old decks that you knew and loved while having every single card ever included, and it can't just let some cards run rampant forever and ever.
---
Wild needs to **Choose One** and, preferably, another format is made that helps enable other gameplay styles. I think Wild should keep everything ever, but another format the cycles through old expansions and enables both new and old metas to arise would be a great way to go.
---
&gt; so while I can voice my unhappiness with the occasional change I disagree with, I dont always have a better answer, so I wont be too harsh on blizz or any player with a differing opinion 
---
This is my take on Genn and Baku. Hall of Fame is kinda a shame, but I can absolutely see why they did it. I certainly can't think of any "satisfying" way to change Genn and Baku, and bluntly speaking, I really *really* like Upgraded Hero Powers from Justicar Trueheart, so I don't want them changing Upgraded Hero Powers fundamentally because Baku messed it up with a Start of Game effect.
---
&gt; I agree, what I intended to mean, was that the staple being a legendary was bad (like boom, rag, etc) and the occasional staple should be more in line with azure, 
---
Yup, I completely agree. If there is going to be a staple, I want it to be less than an Epic.
---
&gt; I just happen to think of azure as close enough, while you dont,
---
Wait, pardon?
---
I really like Azure Drake. I wouldn't change it at all. I would love to see it rotated back into Standard *eventually.* I'm only glad it rotated because now the game is different, and different usually makes for fun.
---
I don't think Azure Drake is "too far," as in "overpowered," but I do think it, like every other card that sees play, is "oppressive." Does that make sense?
---
If they decide to rotate Azure Drake back in in April, I'd be interested to know why, and I would probably prefer that they didn't. But I wouldn't *strongly* disagree with the decision.
---
With that said, where do we disagree on Azure Drake, exactly?
---
In any case, this has again been good fun. I'm more than happy to continue this conversation, ahaha.
---
RUSHING THE ENEMY FTW!
---
I once got it off Syndragosa and got a few cards from my water elementals freezing the enemy's minions but that was literally the only time.
---
Yeah, without knowing python, you can deduce answer has to be B or C
---
That's true. I think that was the most powerful deck I've ever played and I was genuinely upset when Raza got nerfed. Well this and Grim Patron. I started playing after Blackrock Mountain so I avoided the Undertaker Meta.
---
If only it said character instead of minion, you could then get a Hero card changing you into the opponent. At least it would have meme potential that way
---
Cube is the single most problematic card in standard and I can't believe it avoided nerfs for 2 years. Change my mind.   
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
 - Cube Lock  (Skull+Dark Pact)  
---
 - Taunt Druid  (Naturalize)  
---
 - Cube Hunter  (Play Dead)  
---
The meta has been (for a fair portion of the rotation) entirely revolving around which decks can abuse cube the best. The decks that have 1 mana cube activators have dominated the meta consistently.  
---
Damn. If at first you don't succeed try, try, try, try, try, try, try, (ok I ran out of breathe) again.
---
Now Thal‚Äôkiel is dead in WoW AND hearthstone.
---
2nd best was after all the shitpost or actual complaining, it stopped being used well before it's rotation out.  Still wasn't good enough standalone.  
---
I've had this happen several times, if you have enough HS friends it can happen especially if you all tend to be in the better ranks (where there are fewer players).
---
Exactly, only priest left and even the tought scares me
---
One data point is not close to enough to base this on.
---
No... People tried to make moorabi work.
---
I actually was running cauldrons in control mage for a bit... Just hoping for unstable into moorabi.
---
I never got it that way, but somebody evolved into Cho and gave me an evolution that gave me moorabi... Which made me want to pull this off to begin with. 
---
Same thing happened to me. Maybe if we pool our bad luck it'll create a tear in the fabric of reality.
---
What is this, some kinda Suicide Squad?
---

I think you're over-simplifying saying that CW always won Fatigue. Priest could add two extra minions to their deck (which wasn't as common a thing then as it is now) with Entomb. It normally wound up being about who got the most out of their removal, who got Justicar down earlier, and/or who got better stuff from Elite/Map/Monkey.

Thanks for the update, keep us posted!

---
&gt; Something in it for every class
---
Priest would like a word with you.
---
Youre a good friend . Although I must report you win trading :D
---
Imo, the "best" metas always come right after a 3-set rotation.
---
The "worse" comes just before the rotation since there are going to be decks that existed since immediately after the previous rotation.
---
But... I was about to make my post about Hemet Jungle Hunter.
---
You get the same dust as doing nothing if you have a normal copy (except Golden cards).  I'd only do this approach (dusting normal to craft Golden) if you want the golden cards.

For each playable card in question: ([Visual Flowcart](https://imgur.com/a/0lCl8t6))
---
1. If **the playable card is golden,** do nothing.
---
3. If you **are missing the playable card,**  craft golden.
---
2. If the **playable card is non-golden**, decide...
---
  * If you want to upgrade to a golden copy, craft golden.
---
  * If you want the most dust, do nothing.
---
4. If you **have a non-golden COMMON card**, always craft golden. (See **Example 1** Below)
---
5.  If you **don't have enough dust**, craft the highest rarity card you can.
---
We've gotten way more free stuff in other expansions, but nostalgia makes you stupid I guess.
---
My academic espionage rouge begs to differ
---
This card is a staple in a lot of decks. I'd wait until the expansion drops and the meta settles before dusting him. You never know if he becomes integral to a new cool deck.

Okay, sure ignore that part of my comment if you don't like it. My remaining point still stands:
---
Well, if games go longer you'll see a much larger portion of your deck, thus increasing consistency and allowing you to actually make strategic decisions with all the cards you have accumulated.
---
In other words, longer games mean more decisions, which in turn results in a higher chance that the better player outplays the other. Furthermore, the longer the game goes on, the more good and bad draws of both players will average out.
---
Good luck! Stealt minions, cheap spells and the minion that gives you spells when you play spells (Lyra?) got me there after ca 300 bosses
---
Blub blub
---
I usually do it just by getting Scepter of Summoning and drafting tons of big minions. Though that's my strategy with every class, and works quite often. I think my last run with Priest had double 5-mana Kel'Thuzads that made my board unkillable. 
---
The fact that they both play a large amount of spells doesn't make the similar. ZulJin is a much more controllable outcome than Yogg.
---
Just Keleseth in any class is an instaconcede for me. So glad this card and Baku are leaving 
---
When she flips over the second card, there are screws holding down the "triangle" on the cardback. [They are visible here.](https://youtu.be/4lfuiF14jeE?t=29) They are not present in the pack image posted by Blizzard, which is [here.](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/gallery/AE3I61NHVPPQ1551306604187.jpg) A small difference, but possibly a meaningful one.
---
And they play like 3 cards and survive 15 turns
---
Was good expansion not the best and quest rogue by itself was the reason why its not aimply the best..
---
Before some1 says something like quest rogue was beatable even before the nerf. Yea it was.. the problem wasnt that tho. I think it was the first deck that has been introtuced by blizzard that u know  you‚Äôr gonna lose/win at the very beginning of the game depending on your deck type.. zero interaction, zero fun for both playing with and playing against...
---
I have no quests, but I need to watch a friend win.  And maybe we can play sometime... claymore#21584 EU .

r/ArenaHS
---
So the crystal ball on the card is the same symbol as in the upper right corner of the [expansions tease](https://i.redd.it/skfi8ac3kbj21.jpg). Whatever that might tell us.
---
Haha, true enough.
---
Now this is something I can get behind. Maybe I'll try subbing out same cards to include the howlfiend and a doomsayer. Thanks!
---
All gone, friend.
---
Their plot is to bring a new expansion where we have to pay
---
What?
---
LOL my dude thanks for making me LOL while @ work yesterday.  And another big thank you for playing that deathrattle minion ;) 
---
Black Rock Depths. It sounded like: Everyone! Get in here!
---
That‚Äôs aftually fitting with the ‚Äòiron horde bronze flight‚Äô speculation surrounding the third set; in War Crimes, the book where Garrosh escapes and creates alternate draenor, they heroes at his trial all have to face down dark, alternative versions of themselves.
---
Old Gods 2: Electric Boogaloo
---
There are many situations where a Zilliax drawn and played still does not win against an aggro deck. It may extend the game, but if you were already low that extension may not be enough time to recover.
---
My point is that there are more OP cards that whose drawn/played win percentage is much higher than Zilliax and should be the target of these complaints well before Zilliax is.
---
This does not mean that I am saying Zilliax is a weak card. It is a powerful card. I just think it is powerful more because there aren't any other good 5 drops rather than it is an OP card.
---
"Togwaggle will return in The Real RockNRolla"
---
Yeah he has no outs
---
if you want a deathrattle card to stay alive, i don‚Äôt think you know how to properly use it
---
This is why you stay away from wild every time. 
---
So they're trying to mimic the plot between sets that Magic has been doing of recently?
---
Cause that's what it is.
---
Because this isn't the AMA thread, this is the announcement of the AMA.
---
Fire Fly is not a 2 mana 2/4 though. The fly and its token can technically be killed by a single 2/2 minion. Saronite chain gang is not a 4/6 taunt, that would be completely insane. You cannot make that comparison. 
---
You crazy. Think of all the times where you've thought "I need this exact card to win." - imagine giving yourself two (or more!) chances to draw that instead of something else.
---
It's the priest class identity.
---
Something interesting of note is that including the 3 about to rotate out there are 11 sets in wild. 7 of them being full expansions and 4 were adventures. Considering that 2 of the 7 cards referenced an older expansion it is possible we could be seeing a big bad from each of those full expansions.
---
Not broken, but having 3 free 4/4 was too op with a dash of RNG
---
The population has definitely dropped severely. I get the estimated waiting time pop up in queue almost daily now and at popular hours. In the past I'd only ever see that if I was playing at like 4AM or if I was playing casual wild or something.
---
Here we go...
---
Yeah I love evolving a 5 drop into a 4/4
---
Yeah, you right. Togwaggle is much too strong to be placed with a pleb like Yogg.
---
Just flavor. Its what she is able to do.
---
No, it was a 1 cost snowball card and those are really awful for hearthstone. A 1 cost that can fairly easily kill something as big as a 4 or 5 cost early game is not something that is good
---
no power overwhelming, no doomguard but other charge cards DO exist, leeroy and that 5/2 from classic
---
Not a 4 drop. Just a 4 mana minion.
---
some kind of suicide squad expansion?
---
Spell hunter is dead after rotation
---
Ill be back when the sets are released and you've perfectly predicted all three sets
---
Not anymore. That card made me want a lobotomy via plastic spork.
---
Isn't Violet Hold some kind of prison? It could be a team assembled to free someone from jail?
---
Hakkar Druid was very good against Clone Priest but then they ~~nerfed Corrupted Blood~~ made a buggix
---
I tried really hard to make freeze shaman work and the more refined my deck got, the less usefull he became. I actually cut him and that improved my winrate. Majestic.
---
Two people playing at the same time at the same rank range got matched together? SoOoO rAnDoM
---
I don't think it would include serious threats from the Warcraft lore like the Lich King or Kel'thuzad. It would most likely be a team made from characters mainly related to Hearthstone like Rafaam, Hagatha or Dr. Boom.
---
&gt; rouge   
---
   
---
It's not a Warrior card tho
---
Goodbye to a lazy card 
---
I would love to see a form of Deathwing again.
---
Also the Bad Guys Team‚Ñ¢ is pretty good, but I have hopes for Evil Team 5‚Ñ¢.
---
Who? 
---
I think you mean bill cypher confirmed its a gravity falls expansion hype
---
Check HS replay. In all the top decks vs aggro with Zilliax being drawn and played they still lose 20-30% of the time. That is not a small percentage. As well there are much worse cards vs an archtype that should be the focus before Zilliax vs Aggro is.
---
Fal'dorei Strider was the most broken card that sadly didn't have a broken deck to go along with it.
---
We're talking POGs, right?  Milk cap game where you stack em and whack em.  I assume this means they're inserting a "playing for keeps" mode?
---

"Thieves of Dalaran" or something of that nature.
---
I had jaina played on turn 5 once.. That was insta concede and turn away from hs for a week for me after that shit.
---
Yogg was often just a board clear + potential win con. Zuljin can be that plus build you a board of animal companions plus Christmas tree... But it feels just kinda short of a win con. It can often be answered with a medium-sized board clear, and then... Meh.

---
Almost never. Coining it is basically trading a later power play for a like, 65% chance to give a single minion in your deck 1/1... yea no thnx.
---
I guess that could work
---
Which I think is good card design despite everyone hating on him. The card requires planning and buildaround, and it does create a very large tempo swing (which is something a 10 mana card should do), but at the same time a smart opponent can play around it by keeping a boardclear ready for the turn after.   
---
It does big things without being oppressive. Gives you a TON of value on one turn, instead of infinite value over the rest of the game.
---
Was getting wrecked by all the agro we've cycled through. Turn what Jaina?
---
This was a mocking post of all the ones saying goodbye to cards rotating out 
---
Actually that's not true.  I'm fine with people netdecking.  I am not fine with the fact that I am now facing nearly 60% bots, and of the other 40%, most of them are new players.  And my "solution" is to play netdecks and win every game for the next couple weeks, because I chose to concede games I didn't want to play (bots and netdecks).

It's overpowered and will plague Wild whenever Rogue is strong
---
Playing many games of Freeze Shaman in wild I can say, he is more than underwhelming (sadly) would have been such a decent card at 4 mana with the stats
---
Shadow visions wasn't broken, on release people didn't even think it was good.  Shadow visions allows your deck to do whatever it is doing more consistently at the cost of tempo.  Priest is a class with a lack of options in the early turns and some extremely high impact spells on the later ones, so shadow visions was exactly what priest needed to start climbing out of the dumpster it had been stuck in for the entire previous year.

Thanks for the advice, can you explain why wall priest is a good deck? I played it and no matter how you put it you have little options til turn 5. I can understand if its just the best deck or worst bad deck i have versus aggro.

I liked spy mechanic in Gwent 
---
Chameleos stores card ids as a part of game memory. In your case, the card transformed into a hero, but the hero still has a card id. 
---
When Witchwood was released, the interaction between Chameleos and Voodoo Doll was investigated by DisguisedToast. He bounced a chameleos which copied a hero card later. When Chameleos replaces the hero, the hero would be destroyed when the voodoo doll died because the voodoo doll targeted Chameleos‚Äô card id which is now the hero. 
---
I will miss this in my shuffle rogue. I guess it's just their rogue now
---
I beg to differ, buy hsreplay premium and look at odd warrior's rates against every deck in the meta. No other deck has that many super polarized matchups.

---
Divine spirit should of been Hall of famed
---
How was handbuff a failure in Paladin? It wasn't tier 1 sure, but it was decently strong and fun to play. I definitely wouldn't consider it a failure. 
---
It's not just you.  It's been the problem plaguing priest throughout their history.  What most priest players love is cards like entomb or cabal shadowpriest that can completely turn the game on its head in the right situations, and people also tend to hate playing against those cards.  Which is why, for the majority of hearthstone history, priest has been by far the worst class.  They're afraid to make the sort of effects that fit into the priest theme good.  
---
4 mana 3/2
---
Terrible 4 drop.
---
So....prison break expansion?
---
Bad cards do need to exist, or atleast niche cards that are only good in very specific situations and so overall are just bad. Moorabi is not even to that level though, neither was Duskfallen Aviana. Both recent legendaries, intended no doubt to be memes rather than competitive, but are so bad you can't even just have fun with them.
---
 You feel really bad when unpacking them. Class legendaries, atleast millhouse was neutral and you would be better by far in both cases just playing a wisp or magma rager even ion a deck designed to synergize with them.
---
 I mean, really....wtf is that about? It makes no sense, it's a digital CCG, a buff is so easy to do.
---
There will be other expansions the fortune teller will reveal in more trailers that are all villains in violet hold that will break out. The first is Kobolds with Togwaggle as a villain. The next few, my guesses are, Edwin Van Cleef, one of the Old Gods will return, an abomination from Naxx and Mecha-Jaraxxus?

---
&gt; Point is, Blizzard isn't going to print bad legendaries *just so* they dilute the pool of legendaries. 
---
I can give you tons of examples of cards that are printed just so random effects have a very bad roll to balance the really good ones.
---
ex : Cursed blade, Temporus, DF aviana...
---
Illidan there instead of the lady
---
Oh, I 100% agree that true spell hunter will be dead. I was more talking about decks that could benefit from the value of getting to replay 10 or so spells for 10 mana. Obviously we need to see what new expansions bring, but if you can play Zuljin and get 2 animal companions, kill 2 enemy minions, play 3 secrets again, and maybe play 2 copies of a new spell it gets that is good, it could be viable. 
---
But as I said in my previous comment, I do not think a deck of only spells and weapons will be viable ever again in Standard for Hunter. 
---
The face damage wasn‚Äôt the only reason they played doomguard, though
---
Oh man. I am excited for a Miss Cleo hearthstone expansion.
---
Nah, this card has no place in Reno Rogue either
---
if theres a card that gives me 70-80% wr vs aggro the second i drop it im for sure running that card LOL
---
Changing the life instead of the mana would have been to confusing and difficult for newer players to notice.
---
Well no I think the not easily clearing drawback is too big as I said in the first reply. The only time it is strictly better in the priest matchup would be if both gravelsnouts gave the same minion (!). 
---
Bullshit, that's how
---
Dude i thought I was the only one. I started playing tempo rogue and actually havent drawn this card before winning 6 games in a rogue. All I want is spiders :(
---
He‚Äôs not a villain 
---
Dr morrigan?
---
Why would Arena thing be in a expansion(s) teaser?
---
I remember when this happened unintentionally with jade. Some card was leaked, I think jade blossom, and everyone was guessing at what a jade golem would even be, it was pretty fun. Quite a few people guessed it right too.
---
He's a Loot Hoarder and a Kobold Geomancer in one.  Want to draw a card?  Great.  Want to do more damage?  Great.  Nothing flashy, but always useful.
---

---
I prefer Battlerattle
---
It was like not have an internet connection, but i was able to log in to the blizzard site, cant send you the error code as i didnt save it and the game got connection back but thx for the concern
---
From where is it ? Is it the Wotog trailer ? 
---
It‚Äôs more of a year of the dragon teaser, as it doesn‚Äôt hunt to one expansion really. So it‚Äôs not far fetched to think it could be about arena rotation.
---
Totally agreed. Un'Goro came out as I was in the middle of recovering from open heart surgery, and I basically did nothing but play Hearthstone on my tablet for a month while I was laid up. Was fun every day, not cancer, different decks...oh those were the days.
---
Any ideas on when we should expect the first reveal?
---
Well my e-pride as a normal average alex is on the line 
---
Yes, but a 4 drop is a card that you can *drop* on *4* for board presence, and elven does neither of those (3/2 is not board presence on turn 4, and combo doesn't activate unless you have another card, and unless you have backstab target that doesn't happen on 4 usually)
---
Is there any version of healadin that works? I tried a version with Thekal Shrivallah and Kangor and it hasn‚Äôt done well at all.
---
I agree, just think FLJ is worse lol
---
I know what the rotation is but why would I need to save dust for a time when I will get even more dust?
---
What else would PvE give? Can't exactly reward you with actual cards from a Heroic Adventure. 
---
We all know as much as you do
---
Why are you like this?
---
The revenge of Artifact
---
All the cards that will rotate out will give you full dust refund, for example if you craft baku it will give you 1600 dust, then you can disenchant it for 400 dust. You can do it for every card rotating out for a boat load of dust
---
I have no clue what you're on about. 
---
Well, I agree that DK have too much of an impact on who wins, but my points weren't specific to the current meta. 
---
Honestly [this](https://twitter.com/renojackson_hs/status/1092809791880216576) is a much better solution that what you said. 
---
Apart from embracing the inevitable, you also deny your opponent the chance to play a game with Keleseth on curve. I like to think about it this way. Fuck turn 1 coin Keleseth shadowstep Keleseth
---
depends on how many HS-playing friends you have
---
Good catch!
---
Agree with this.  It was too strong not to run, but at the same time you'd have games where it was a 4 mana 12/12 and others where it was just a 4/4 and you never got any spiders.
---
It was a cool combo with Myra's, and cool with bounce effects, but I hope the next strong 4-drop Rogue gets is more consistent.
---
I have the big dumb 
---
start running,prey!!!
---
I really like that idea
---
How would that thematically make sense though? It would also potentially build a bridge between the Deathrattle segment of Priest with its Big variant.
---
Even then, unlike previous recipients of Wild card changes, Big Priest is not making Wild a miserable place to play at least not as much as either Naga Sea Witch or Combo Druid nor is it format dominating like either of those decks were.
---
Jataxxus works when there isn't a lot of burn in the meta. We need to see if Cloning priest, mage, or Holy Wrath Paladin are tier 1. My meta prediction for this rotation is "I have no clue," so I'm just going to wait and see. 
---
Guys, I have a confession. I crafted this day 1 or the Frozen Throne because despite everyone theorycrafting that freeze shaman wouldn't work, I still thought it would. It still haunts me 2 years later 
---
post yogg nerf sure
---
&gt; Honestly they should just drop 1 card with the new keyword in it before the full expansion reveal so we all go crazy over what the hell the word means.
---
MtG did something like that with their most recent set. The card was Light Up the Stage and the keyword was Spectacle.
---
Actually feels like something the UI could easily support

---
Are you playing casual? Try playing against a friend or the Inn Keeper until you're a little more comfortable. 
---
The Void Elves and Alleria did not receive their powers from the Old Gods, but from the Void itself. This is a big difference as they never dealt with the Old Gods, but with the Void in different forms.
---
The whispers they hear are those coming of the element itself. Void shows you all possibilities, but none are exactly correct nor wrong. You can't say they are backed by the Old Gods, because the Old Gods did not give them that power. You are right in that there are ways to use the Void for a good cause, just like there are ways to use the Light for wrongdoings.
---
Lmao yes your proposal is clearly equally as likely and viable a simply reproducing a card that already exists for another class. 
---
Your argument is worthless. 
---
Fought against my friend in arena. He was like kept emoting to get my attention. I was like "what a fucking asshole bm at the beginning of the match?" Then I kicked his ass and bm back. Then he messaged me after the match and I realized why the intensive emote.
---
My name is Ben Brode
---
Countess Ashmore? It's year of the dragon afterall.
---
You are missing one :)
---
I'm guessing it's 5 villain hearthstone original characters., since she's the first card, and the second one seems like it could be Togwaggle (candle, crown, gold). If I guessed that right, that would leave Rafaam, Hagatha, and maybe Dr Boom (he had no personality/development in WoW, and I can't think of a 5th) as the other 3.
---
No u
---
It would make any deck that could use it better
---
Rumors on some forums are saying they are building something up for a big WoW release.  There is some theories that they are going to do like a Legion of Doom thing in a future WoW expansion and tie it into anything WoW related (like a hearthstone set).  Would be cool if this turns out to be true.
---
God, Witchwood did feel like garbage.

I'm going to try to give them the benefit of the doubt, though. There was a noticeable drop in overpowered cards, which was extremely necessary after Frozen Throne and Kobolds. This rotation will hopefully give more not-broken cards their chance in the limelight.
---
Something something Oceans 11 Hearthstone
---
Hmm probably getting a shit ton of minions and then buffing them with cards like raid leader and blessing of might. Also Frostwolf can work but most decks have enough removal for that.
---
I laughed so hard. Thank you for this!
---
It wouldn't be completely unlike Blizzard to give Priest minor dragon synergies for a couple years and then leave them out once the dragon expansion arrives.
---
it's s6 only that's why you can use emulator and the model I put in (if you haven't yet)
---
They who wins achieve ultimate bragging rights forever.
---
Sir they've gone down the ventilation shaft!
---
I mean yes, I beat Warrior in Dungeon Run in 10 bosses, but I can‚Äôt build a deck properly due to a lack of knowing what cards are good and which ones aren‚Äôt, as well as how to expand my collection in the best way possible. Assistance is appreciated!
---
One of the points that people laid out was that an OTK should not be allowed if it has 2 or more ticks from Thaurissan.  I was just pointing out that this clearly qualified because you can't even have Thaurissan in standard.
---
Is this 2015?

hsreplay.net supports uploading your collection via Hearthstone Deck Tracker and filtering decks by what you have in your collection (and you can toggle an additional dust value on top of that)

---
Didn't they give everyone a free quest card? Those were at least as strong as most minion legendaries in their day.
---
I got it before I checked the comment, the joke was obvious and mildly amusing 5/10
---
Dragon Control Priest is good in Wild.  It's largely the same cards from the current Standard itineration but people tend to include Velen and Spirit Lash, plus Drakonid Operative, Netherspite Historian, and Azure Drake.  Some people drop the Velen and top out their curve at 5, run Divine Spirit/Inner Fire instead of Mind Blasts, or make other various changes but if you have the Standard Dragon Control Priest it's very cheap to convert to the Wild version that can take you to Legend.
---
It's also "The Year of the Dragon" coming up and Dragon Control Priest has existed for a very long time so it's not impossible that it'll get enough support to transition into the next year or reappear in a later meta.
---
It was.
---
Since the set will be in some way a revisit of old sets, they will probably want to showcase the memorable cards of those sets, like Dr. Boom's Lab.
---
GvG: Possibly Dr. Boom, but both Hemet and Dr. Boom have two legendaries already, so who knows.
---
TGT: "Who am I? None of your business!" Perhaps we'll finally find out who that was.
---
WotOG: Hard to tell, maybe the Fortune Teller will be the actual card, and she'll have an effect like one or all the old Gods.
---
Un'Goro: No idea, there's The Cavern Belows, which isn't an actual person. I'll go out on a limb and say no Un'Goro.
---
I haven't seen anyone bring it up yet, but they could remix Classic Legendaries, like they did in Old Gods. I'm not sure  who they would go with though.
---
pretty frustrating against dragon priest when playing 4 minion rez priest. Tho it made for an interesting play involving playing then killing off your own Prophet Valen 
---
Lol, that‚Äôs pushing it.
---
Crafted him for a Control Style even paladin, works surprisingly well.
---
Definitely not worth dusting Sees way too much play 
---
Hes Wow!
---
Yeah definitely dont do that to make this deck. It isnt worth it. Its fun for a while but only if you have most of the cards already.
---
Or r/prequelmemes    star wars.
---
Thanks, wish he would just say it so I can try to learn it propperly. 
---
English is my second language, so the rouge/rogue thing never sticks, and on the Phone so I dont bother checking.
---
I'm guessing that second character is not Toggwaggle but Rakanishu the little fire dude in Toggwaggle's hat. 
---
1. The card shows his Togg's crown bent and broken on the floor.
---
2. Rakanishu is shown as a character in the promo pic showing what is going to be in the single player content [Here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/372515685093474307/550713726764843028/20NJS1QNU2JU1551306604231.jpg) (Where it says friendly encounter).
---
He‚Äôs been a bit harsh but in case your ever setting a legend goal it‚Äôs good to understand the situation. It takes roughly 3 times as long to get from rank 5 to legend that it takes to get from 20 to 5. So you got about a quarter of the way.
---
Yes, serious discussions about cards are allowed.  Shit posting and memes will be removed.
---
For some reason the deck actually shuffles when that happen so it would have some sort of anti synergy with itself as if you scried multiple times it would mess it up a lot. 
---
The toki event was so confusing in that regard as shuffling really is not as apparent in digital card games. I at least would expect it to just be placed randomly in the deck without scrambling the order.
---
Of course, (I shouldn't have linked the article in that case &gt;.&lt;) Sorry about that, I think my caffeine levels are running low :P So glad that the restart helped! :)
---
If you don't have great 2 drops then take the bird. But zilliax is usually such a good 2 for 1, and you will always gain 3 life off of it. 
---
If the expansion was not a month a way I was highly considering it. Made my highest climb in ladder to 4 and dropped to 10 at the end of the month because of a run of just priest players.
---
Actually, take zilliax. It's just better
---
Wild is a joke these days.  Honestly, blizzards refusal to touch it has ruined it for me, and I‚Äôm saying that S somebody who historically always preferred wild.  I plan on dusting my wild collection next expansion.
---
Anduin, Cloning Gallery, Big Priest, Dragon Priest? Theres lots of non control going on.
---
That would be busted and swingy at 10 mana.
---
As long as you thank your fellow redditors by sharing screenshots of every rank you pass and every pve boss you kill, it's fine.
---
I play a version of resurrect Priest sometimes because I don‚Äôt want to to play Hunter (I refuse) and all my other fun-ish decks are useless in ranked, but I mainly use Benedictus to steal around half to 2/3rds of my opponent‚Äôs deck and then have fun with it, Mechathuns excepted. I like to think that by doing stuff like that I force my opponent to honk about all the possible interactions and thus make the games less predictable for them. I also like to think they welcome that. But maybe they just want to win in about five turns and move on.
---
So there are 66 total mage spells in wild.
---
3/66 * (1/66*1/66*1/66) = 0.0000158%
---
Dont if I mathed right
---

I was joking my man. 
---
Any bodies? Not just *any* bodies.
---
Ohhh I remember hearing about Red vs Blue
---
The DK alone is enough to give up even I think. Then you can also run thekal for high roll potential. But at that point might as well play OTK paladin...
---
&gt; the greatest expansion: ~~Un'Goro~~ KotFT
---
Fixed. *hides*
---
Lol who plays wild
---
It's going to wild so who cares. ;)
---
Beyond that and in addition to what you've got. I'd like if a 1/1 is killed it's not resurrected as an 8/8 - that would be nice.  
---
There was a Zoo Buff at the Winter playoffs - two copies of Grim Rally which destroys a minion and gives all other minions +1/1.  It lost pretty badly when he kept drawing his expensive cards and couldn't setup enough floods.
---
Again, no reason to get hostile... "I like this chair" isn't a specification... The better metaphor would be if i ask you what you think of my furniture, and you say "I like this chair" af that point i would assume you're not a fan of the rest. 
---
Anywhos... This really isn't an interesting discussion at all so I'm gonna leave it at this, cheers mate.

TJ and Admirable are cocasters. TJ has a short mohawk, and Admirable is bald.
---
Dr.Boom is both in WoW and Hearthstone.
---
Lich King/KT are also both in WoW and Hearthstone.
---
Nothing prevents Blizzard from reusing Lich King/KT again and again in Hearthstone. They own it all.
