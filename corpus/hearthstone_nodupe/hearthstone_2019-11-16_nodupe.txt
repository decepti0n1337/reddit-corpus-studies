I think it's more because Battlegrounds came out and he was one of the main guys behind it.

Game Mode is still in Beta... i am sure there will be quests when it comes out of beta

Dream on

Uhh, why am I getting downvoted? I genuinely don't know. Was I rude? Did I write in a bad tone? Is my issue irrelevant? Are there too many posts like mine? (Believe it or not, I browse freqiemtly and I didn't see a single one) Did I make lots of grammar mistakes? Did I trigger someone? Am I anti Hong Kong? Did I evolve desert hares?? I'm so lost

Well now some games you can play with the mechs and some games you can play with the beasts and then sometimes it’s your turn to be bottom 4!

Are you trying to say seppuku?

Shudderwock + cold light seer is strong late game
---
It's been bugged for a lot of users too. I think it should be fixed over the weekend.
---
Same for me, here's what mine looks like: https://imgur.com/a/vXogBW4
---
I finished 5-3 and it has looked like this since. I don't really care if I don't get rewards or whatever, but would be nice if I could queue brawl again lol.
---
The guy’s comment got deleted. Is that the same person who posts ‘thicc black girl’ on this subreddit on a daily basis?
---
Wait what? Ra is an uncollectable card in standard and mogu isnt in battleground. In neither game can you get Ra off of (i assume conjurers) calling
---
Pretty sure it's based on health before the round. So if 2 players get knocked out in the same round the one with more health before the round will get the higher rank.
---
What was your normal cards to bombs ratio?
---
Amalgam gets all the light unlike my buddy Junkbot /s
---
r/Woooosh
---
I'd like 2 things, but mostly 1 thing. Give me the option to speed up animations if I want so I can get more shop time. It's not fair when one person faces a ghost and gets 100 seconds to shop and reroll and actually think about their turn. 
---
Second thing which is more a QOL is I don't want to hear ticking for 20 seconds. Especially when I'm watching battlegrounds streams while playing and the ticking overlaps. We have a timer that states the exact time left it could easily only start ticking at 10 or 5 seconds.
---
Doesn't that mean you could concede and not wait for the animations to play out?
---
Try reinstalling the game
---
The Evolve problem should be adresse...  It ridiculous, just move back the cards back to wild, that's it.
---
The base design is cool but the balance is atrocious. The early turns are automatic and then the RNG snowballs completely out of control immediately. There's no late game for anyone but the top 2 players.
---
Not really a good time to come back sincerely...
---
You're not missing out trust me, just another dogshit brawl in the long line

When it comes down to 1 customer sure, in the grand scheme of things they're gunna piss away too many customers, I can't see this being a net gain for any company
---
The discover pool is from only BG minions so the explorers don’t really work unless they add a ton of dragons (currently minions can’t discover/drop themselves).
---
Brightwing will basically be a utility minion, an alley cat with upside once selling from hand is implemented. Lots of highroll potential. There aren’t any minions currently like that (adding cards to our hand), but I could see it.
---
Deryl is busted as hell if you know how to use him, but not many people can do it properly. Easily 10/10 with the asterisk that you know how to play him.
---
It's a bit janky but if you reset your network adapter as soon as a long fight (7v7 with lots of health and deathrattles) begins, the game will auto resolve the battle after you reconnect.
---
I've had the timer at over 120 secs because of this!
---
Uh. Was 6-0 in the brawl the other night. Logged in today and have an empty chest and there's the new brawl. Didn't get my weekly pack. That's some bullshit.
---
Funny thing is, I tried this deck now just for the lulz, and I have been facerolling [everything ](https://imgur.com/gallery/oQB4VQN) unexpectedly in the tavern.

I have only lost twice in my current run so far.

No, it's 50% more Heroes. 2*1.5 = 3
---
Growing so little in power over so many turns seems really unusual. I don't think that would happen in a tournament.
---
Why is professor putricide so low on this list
---
Funny, but, this is only really redundant if your opponent didn't grow as much as your did, and didn't get any [[Annihilan Battlemaster]]
---
Toxfin is the token I'm constantly tanking extra damage from randomly.
---
In the classic set: Lorewalker Cho, Nat Pagle, Illidian, Nozdormu, and many more.
---
Good joke.
---
The kerning is off
---
Hey, so I’ve only played 3 Battlegrounds matches, so far.
---
Why is middle best? 
---
What things should I be putting on the far left and far right?
---
Even one proc feels bad when win or lose could come down to attack rng. Like if I win one round but then he gets a lucky snipe the second round even though both our boards stayed the same
---
If he’s holding himself then he gots a big ass hand for his age and size
---
I don't get it
---
That’s all Akazamzarak has, Ice Block and Splitting Image (and Venomstrike).
---
Variance is a large part of the game. Sometimes you eat the bear, sometimes the bear eats you.
---
But real whizbang isn’t amazing, the randomness makes it balanced because you could get the useless ones or a really POG one
---
Play wild then?
---
What golden minion did you end up settling on?
---
I also got to play the new brawl no, but no Classic pack rewars for me either.
---
Yup. I hoped they would give up but they never did
---
Breaking bad tv show
---
&gt; Otherwise, I don't understand why it's unfair that the person winning the hardest gets to pick their minions first...
---
You don't understand why its a bad thing that people with worse internet, mobile devices, or older machines are always disadvantaged, and even players with identical hardware and connections can be disadvantaged if either their team or their opponent's has deathrattles that spawn minions?
---
You really don't understand?
---
Weirdest deck I've gone up against was Patches, Evolve, Kezan Mystic.  The evolve on patches created a doomsayer, clearing the initial board but the three remaining patches plus Kezan in hand removed my ice block and killed me.
---
.
---
What was he going to do if he didn't make a doomsayer?  Iceblock mage doesn't kill minions and the patches lock his board. I'm trying to imagine the expression on his face the first time he runs this and realizes the iceblock counter can't be played
---
The tiering is really bad imo. Some of these cards completely break the balance lol. Scaled Nightmare is crazy broken, it'll basically carry you till the late game if you can get it early, Speaker and Voone offer too much value for a tier 3, Templar is overpowered if you pick her up early, especially with the existence of Deryl. Herald seems too overpowered, Tier 6 cards are key cards and you can get them easily with the free goldens, plus he basically gives you free money every round. Onyxia is pretty weak, the 8/8 statline is decent but the battlecry is pretty useless when your board should be filled with key cards by the time you get to tier 5. Even if you wanted to sell and retry, you need a key card to build your new board around, which Onyxia isn't. Well, take it with a pinch of salt though, there's no way to know unless it gets released but I think it's quite clear that there is definitely something wrong here.
---
every time i lose it feels bad. blizzard should make every game a draw.
---
Snip snap warlock. Doesn't necessarily need to be warlock, combo is just easier with warlock.
---
Yes! More of the lower cost minions, around 3 less in total  for each higher tier that makes:
---
Tier 1 : 18 copies of each minion
---
Tier 2 : 15 copies of each minion
---
Tier 3 : 13 copies of each minion
---
Tier 4 : 11 copies of each minion
---
Tier 5 : 9 copies of each minion
---
Tier 6 : 6 copies of each minion
---

---
But they work on it !! Next Wednesday, we will be again able to make a new brawl...  And you can bet that the eventual fix will come without compensation.
---
This is outdated. there were a patch and he changed his mind on a few:
---
https://twitter.com/Kripparrian/status/1194494117578969089
---
This is a pretty cool and unique deck idea. Thanks for the post.
---
I only found 1 lightfang this whole time and played it for a couple of rounds. But i started to loose so i replaced it fast again.
---
Thing is my opponent already had 2 seperate mama bears with 10+ attack when i took the first screenshot. At that point i kinda had to commit to my weak units and started making them golden astead of trying to exchange them. I could have taken 20-30 hp damage easily if i would have weakened my board significantly for 1 turn.
---
So i kinda just went with it and let the rng take over.
---
Dragons could be a good start
---
I actually lost a round because I couldn’t play my golden minion in time
---
I think that could be nice as a sort of call to Patchwerk's Hero power, in the spirit of this Hero design utilizing the other hero powers as well.
---
As rogue 
---
Patches the pirate
---
The 2/1 pirate with charge if you have a weapon
---
Cold blood
---
And just go face
---
Yeah, you got it. A good deal of the passive heroes just effect the tavern that round, so those ones would generally be excluded from the pool.
---
I'll keep this in mind in the future. I was wanting to get the wording right without having it be too wordy, so this is helpful. Thank you.
---
The worst feeling is that is happened at 11-2. Didn't play around it by seeing the obvious future and retiring the run. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Yeah i can see your point, i was quite drunk when I replied, you can indeed coin out three mech warpers on turn 2 so it doesn't make a difference playing a 1 cost mech on turn 1.
---
Based on health percentage going into the fight, as indicated by the ranking on the left.
---
Seems adjusting the life total really is the most obvious and fine-grained way to balance heroes in general... For some heroes like the curator I find it hard to imagine any other good way of balancing them, really.
---
Well, me. Because that's literally what I've been doing every day. It's been a fun way to play the same game, yet focus on a different and new goal every day. Then, after you've beaten everything and just have to wait for a new one, it's a good time to just get off until tomorrow. Doesn't get boring. 
---
I did refill the quest today, and I just got the same quests with different classes. The problem is I'm not getting different quests the next day. I'm getting the same quest over and over again. That's gonna get tiring. I don't want to do that for a year. Feels kinda pointless.
---
Opponent's POV: "Why is this guy BMing me?"
---
Warrior should be doable.
---
Best part about being a casual player is that nobody's playing broken degenerate nonsense at rank 20 in wild, so you have a chance to actually have fun.
---
Huh? But there's an app?
---
Wut?
---
I'll play at least until the Dragon pack comes out. But if it's a whole month of this. Yeah, I might just be out. 
---
Unless I can find something else fun like the quests that adds some excitement to playing the same way every day.
---
Also the reason why you never houndmaster a hyena
---
Jamie?
---
You got to pay the troll toll.
---
Let's say nobody presses it, no harm right?
---
But lets say everyone is done and presses it. Saves everybody time right? How could this be a bad idea??
---
I have my fun once hitting 5. Going for Legend isn't worth the effort imho, but 5 is a bit of dedication for an afternoon
---
Yeah, I talked to some people on the Discord about it. And it seems like a lot of the more hardcore players just want an easy way to get some gold and then move on to do their own thing. 
---
I wish there was a way they could make it "easy" without being boring. 
---
I don't mind too much that they removed the Murloc, Divine Shield, Overload, or Secrets ones. Although those do seem interesting (And I don't ever recall getting Overload or Secrets). 
---
But I definitely don't want it to just be "play three games" over and over every day. Which is what I've seen for the last week.
---
I have a chance in the middle of the game to get laggy that goes away when that game is done regardless of connection or speed
---
And unless I’m missing something, OP wouldn’t be able to deal lethal even if they weren’t killed this turn
---
To make it strong enough... "At the start of each turn, *activate* a random hero power."
---
Passives just do their thing, when you get an active it's already applied, no gold necessary. (Divine Shield would be random ally)
---
MrDestructoid ANOTHER MrDestructoid GAME MrDestructoid ANOTHER MrDestructoid MECH MrDestructoid BUILD MrDestructoid
---
 To make it strong enough... "At the start of each turn, *activate* a random hero power."
---
Very true, can't remember the last time I won without an amalgam in the build. Card's too strong
---
Speaking of which, isn't it about time we had another post asking for him to be in the Classic set?
---
^^Cause ^^I'd ^^really ^^like ^^that...
---
I basically forfeit my first game... it's already too fast, but with all the pauses, I go some turns where i can move one card at best.
---
Also this table really shows why Mech/Beast is dominant.. most cards are tribal, with barely any representation of demons or murlocs...
---
"make a shittier George" yea thanks for the advice
---
That’e why u gotta get 4 Lightfangs like me. Had a big ass Hydra, Amalgan and the demon who gets HP based on the amount of damage u have taken.
---
Maybe it starts when the first player leaves combat, and your opponent restarted the game to skip all the animations and cripple you.
---
Never.
---
They only care about Battlegrounds.
---
Thanks! I was putting Cobalt on the right haha... whoops! 
---
As for the growers... how many is too many?
---
True
---
At least poisonous animation shouldn't be shown on minions which die normally.
---
Do you mean that you have been able to do this or you would like to be able?
---
Same here. Bliz said they will compensate but I doubt it. Probably will have to just accept the loss and move on like the no quest bug.
---
thanx, i did it and it helps a lot
---
Who said they will compensate and when?

Because in &lt;redacted&gt; only &lt;redacted&gt; may have an upright crown.
---
Hey OP, good idea. Consider yourself updooted.
---
Personally I’d say 3 is getting excessive so I‘d stick with 2 but it depends if course. If your quality if minions is very high you might only want 1. And I have occasionally run 3 hydras in the mid game when I had multiple beast spawners (Rat trap and infested wolf). More than 2 rarely comes up anyway because they combine at 3 to a golden version so you’d essentially need to find exactly 5 (or 8 lol but if you had 2 golden ones I’d honestly just run more spawners) for that to even come up. That’s very rare to happen
---
Would be funny if zap sniped both of them.
---
Thank you sir
---
I like this idea.
---
Dust dust dust bro
---
You can’t see it in this pic but i did have 4 taunt minions.
---
Most of all which hero seems to be the best to get first place with, maybe which hero is most likely to win once you are in a 1v1 situation, and in general see the stats of all heroes, not just 5! :)
---
Also it would be funny to see how much the winrate of the divine shield hero goes down if a nefarian is on the battleground\^\^
---
Also it would be funny to see how much the winrate of the divine shield hero goes down if a nefarian is on the battleground^^
---
They said they tested it but it felt like there was always at least one person who used whole timer. But it is not out of table and they can consider it in future.
---
Ok i didnt know that. My point is still that you can roll ridicously (i spelled that wrong and im too lazy to fix it) high and ruin the game bc of rng already.
---
And why am i getting downvoted? I was just misinformed about ra?
---
This was already discussed previously? Do you have source for that? I’d like to read
---
I feel it’s a win win to implement. If not everyone is ready, then it doesn’t skip. If they are, then it does. There isn’t really a downside to add it I wouldn’t think.
---
A deck tracker with achievements
---
Well you press hero power each turn until you are at 1,2 or 3 life and you always have to make sure to spend the coins, you cant ever fall behind!
---
Usually you should spend most of them by turn 5,6,7,8 for some strong mid game plays that carry you to the late game.
---
way to balance? this power: since there are so many of them, maybe ability to see what next one will be? also removal of useless abilities like patchwerk,afkay, and curator after turn 1, so it would spawn the 1/1 minion and then curator hero power would leave the pool. removal of bartendotron passive if you have highest tavern tier available would imporove the whizbang further. rat king hero power is next turn? just show at the hero power picture a ? and hero power text would read: passive hero power when you buy a tribe, give it +1/+2. tribe type will be given at start of your turn.
---
Around 4500
---
That enemy board has 4 20 attack minions and 4 20 health minions.
---
I feel like it won't make a huge difference, divine shield just negates it.
---
lol
---
just teaching you ez win
---
get level 2 recruit good minions get a pair
---
find a 3rd minion don't buy freeze board level up to 4
---
buy 3rd play golden card discover tier 5 and get enforcer = 95% win the game no matter what
---
this card is most busted card in the game and its only tier 5
---
this one is by far best strategy in battleground right now
---
you can't die coz you at level 2 recruiting strong minions don't tell me there's something hard about that
---
on my ranks every game winner is basically decided who got enforcer first
---
I had the same issue, I can play the brawl now but it shows as if I already won my award when in fact I did not. Winning one more game on top of my previous 7 wins from before pausing the brawl, did not do anything either.
---
In battlegrounds there's no enemy face so attack value is infinite.
---
Lich Baz'Hial. Spam hero power, rush to get that 5 star, hurting yourself profit, demon whose name I forgot and Malganis. Easy in theory, hell no against mechs.
---
Uhm... yes? 🍁
---
*Wild earthen scales Druid has joined the chat*
---
Hyperinflation is so absurdly broken that it's clear the designer didn't actually think about how it would be used. Auctioneer into hyperinflation on turn seven is a three mana draw five cards combo. At that point it doesn't matter if a couple cards in your hand cost more, because you've just drawn a whole new hand, and you still have four mana to work with to spam low cost spells. The only time hyperinflation is even bad is when you have five or more cards in hand (because otherwise the coins can offset the cost), and even then it's an insane ritual spell that lets you cast stuff three turns in advance.
---
Must be the last season, I remember the mom has another baby later on in the show
---
The thing is you don't even need a menagerie comp-- if you find two amalgams (or play as curator and find one) then you can still build towards a mech endgame and benefit from Lightfang.
---
Amalgam is really the problem right now--I don't think the card should be in battlegrounds at all. Replace it with a 3/4 for each tribe.
---
It doesn't, it's just a play on words from the show malcolm in the middle
---
Wild lightspawn would like to have a word with you as well.
---
Yup, that should work. I had the same problem and fixed it that way earlier today.
---
There is a 4 20 over there, NICE!
---
? Lightspawns have always the same atk as their health. If you set the ATK to infinity it wont od anything if it still has 5 health
---
Tar rager has exactly one attack on yeti, a card that hasn't been played in years. And it gets completely shut down by taunt. How is that overpowered in the slightest? This straight up seems like something hearthstone would print for filler.
---
9999 is the highest score

Oooh you right I was thinking of something different.
---
No, I was being polite.
---
It wasn't recognisable as any known form of communication. At least none from this planet.
---
The other being totems 🗿?
---
I never said it was overpowered, I said it was bad design.
---
Also, one thing you seem to be missing that is what makes it such bad design: it's a 5/5, you hit it, it becomes a 5/3. It goes back down to a 5/1, but on the enemy turn goes back up to a 5/5.
---
But you do realize that the two nerfs for Kabal Lackey are basically the same, right ?
---
Same issue here. The Tavern Brawl finally reset a couple of hours ago from "Battle of the Bans" to the new "Top 3" and the Chest containing the Pack is open, but I haven't received the actual pack.
---
It's almost like not everyone started playing HS the moment the beta came out.
---
If what you have told me is true, you would've gained my trust.
---
Ignoring that you obviously can beat amalgam without having your own, there are many alternatives to removing the entire menagerie archetype.  There will be nerfs, buffs, new cards and new heroes.  It's beta.
---
Give it to me!
---
It was mentioned during the Blizzcon 'Telling a Year Long Narrative' Panel by Dave Kossak. I even got a link for you!

---
Went down to 7 heath as nefarian doing this yesterday. Fortunately I was able to get some golden junkbots.
---
Was about to make the same post. I didn't buy the entry but on my free entry I was 1-1. Now I played and won, the chest is open and I have 2 wins. 
---
No rewards.
---
I get that for when there are still 8 people but when the match progresses and people fall off this will speed up the battle in a lot of cases, especially the last 3/4 turns
---
Or get malganis and get free coins
---
Advertize#11860 NA trading 80g quest. Will show quest. You go first.
---
You mean +16/+16, amirite?
---
- You must have malganis so that you can play 11 coins each turn,
---
- that means also you must have demon strat
---
- which also means you must push for mid game or you ll get beaten by mech and beasts.
---
I usually go for level to find an early malganis, and take 10-20 dmg for the first 3-4 turns then go all the way with buffs
---
Y malganis is a must
---
Friendly tip, you won’t actually get a double triple from 3 alleycats (or 3 murloc tidehunters). You need Shudderwock hero power or a Brann to do it from 3. This is because when you buy 3rd one, it automatically combines in your hand, and when you play the golden version, the golden token it spawns will not combine with the 2 non golden versions!
---
Yea did the same.. even twice.

The gleaming queen leans on memes between streams to glean supreme extreme dreams. Gasoline

I know Blizzard thinks this is balanced, but really. First of all more than 50% opponents are shaman. Somehow I am trying to survive with rogue. But these games really...I don't have words to describe.
---
This is what I am looking for :)
---
Idk, i just feel like it has the capacity to breed resentment. not that that's a justified or unavoidable thing, but i just imagine that if seven people consistently ready up pretty quickly, but the A. F. Kay is always waiting until it runs out, then I feel like it would tend to make make the other seven people pretty tilted at him, which may or may not be justified, especially if he's new and doesn't even realize the button is there.  
---
Which is not to say that if i were the God of Hearthstone, i wouldn't snap my fingers to add it. I'm just saying that I can appreciate why a company like Blizzard, which doesn't even allow all-chat in its MOBA, would leave it out.
---
Until they give us the rewards, just profit from this brawl and make some quick daily gold.
---
Wow dude! I like this
---
lol i'm such a dipshit i run out of time

Have you try download from Amazon Underground? There is the name of app where u had download Hearthstone
---
Do you need fake reddit points though?
---
PFFF.... Hahahahaha
---
Brutallus would be absolutely fucking bonkers. His hero power might as well say "After 10 combats, win the game"
---
Don't need a pirate when Patches is a pirate. Better to swap for something more useful. 
---
You deal that amount of damage on t2, if you going 2nd, your board sticks and you have 3 Marks exactly. vs Evolve Shaman you lose the board, when their 1-2 Mogus kills some of your Patches and evolves them to random 8 drops + 2 drops from Patches. Next turn can be Evolve again. You only have 1 dmg hero power, which is too slow, especially with random taunts.
---
I tried Amazon app store, if it's something different please send a link
---
Smurfin?
---
I've won with the lich without Malganis. I just used my hero power each turn for 4 or 5 turns, got ahead on tavern so I had first dibs on the OP mechs. Then stopped using hero power.
---
Right. I mean, if you're so much better than them, why are you not fixing the issue and h as ending out the dozens of free packs you think you're entitled to? You make it seem like it would be less effort for you than throwing your temper tantrum on reddit (in the same subreddit where they already made known they were fixing the issue and would be compensating those effected).
---
Nope, just watched some streams before I started playing since I didn’t get early access

The issue being that you then have to play Mal'Ganis, which isn't great unless you have him gilded or are running demons.
---
Agreed. I'm not sure it'll be used a lot (sometimes people will use their full time bank) but if it's used once in a while, why not add it?
---
One of the thing I really like about battlegrounds is that some turns are REALLY fast; No more "staring a screen for 2 minutes while your opponent decides which of your two 1-1 he wants to ping". 
---
But the 70+ seconds turns are kinda bad. It's a bit excessive too. 
---
Sure if you're a new player you might need the time to learn the minions and all that, but it feels bad to make all veterans lose 1 minute *every single game until the end of time*, just for the new players who'll need it once or twice.
---
One of the many reasons why amalgam is OP. It’s the only way to get full value from menagerie cards.
---
I do this every single time the game gives me the choice and it’s worked really well for me up to 5k, it’s so satisfying to go from getting stomped every round to knocking out the top players from bottom place out of nowhere.
---
Not yet. If I remember correctly it's something they're looking into.

Fair enough, and I agree with you! I just wouldn't want the paid bonuses to be *too* good... one of the major appeals of this game mode is that it's mostly impossible to be P2W. 
---
Also, reading through my past comment, I realized I omitted something: you currently **can** complete (some) quests in Battlegrounds. I got a 100g quest yesterday to "Win five games in *any* mode" and was able to finish it by placing top 4+ in BGs games.
---
I don't know how often that'll happen, but it's neat that it will at least happen occasionally.
---
Yep. Would need to look into how long the interactions and all take. But even at the very most, you'd have 90 seconds. Most of the time you have less. 
---
While you could certainly buy and sell a minion every 0.5 seconds. The spawning animation, Khadgar animation, tavern refill, etc all cut into that.
---
I liked bob until battlegrounds came out. Never knew somebody could TALK SO FUCKING MUCH
---
I‘m something of a f2p player myself and once I crafted stuff like Sylvanas, Rag, Reno, N‘zoth etc. I‘ve been enjoying it quite a bit
---
Nope, they won't, it's your account after all. :)
---
Running the same game on different devices at the same time though will log you out automatically.

After a not so satisfying 3 - 3 run.
---
The 2 most recent are my favorite. Both are fun and I dont know which one is better.
---
Have you tried buying it from the blizzard website?
---
Pogos FTW!
---
Casual is the Legend MMR system except it never resets so if you play it enough you’ll eventually get stuck in what’s basically 80% identical to the current legend meta but with arguably far more toxic players. (This probably isn’t an issue for 99% of the playerbase since I got here thanks to literal years of memeing around in casual on my phone)
---
Rank floors are where the fun decks hang out imo. Having a blast at rank 5 this month since idgaf about hitting legend in this ridiculous meta.
---
... apprentice rarely comes in handy, tbh.  The list just doesn't have that "miracle" engine as you mentioned. Thalnos would be nice.
---
As annoying evolve is to play against, it's pretty funny that he was just 1 missing combo piece away from you creating a check-mate boardstate yourself on turn 5
---
Just stop playing the game entirely. You know how they're supporting China it's all messed up
---
Another 'cheap' old school option would be to run an 'Enrage' minion like Amani berserker, Temple Berserker or just run Sunreaver.
---
amalgam isn't broken, it's just a very important card in the balance of the game. He enables different strategies and is really important in allowing you to change strategies throughout the game. Like, yeah, he's a really good card, but there's really nothing you can do about it. He enables menagerie, otherwise a bunch of cards go out the window.
---
None! Save money for standard packs
---
Get as many golden minions as you can. Spend them when you hit 4 stars. Get golden lightfang enforcer. Get menagerie board then afk and let +8/+8 every turn win you the game.
---
Lol, reading the comments...
---
Junkbot and Cobalt would overrun battlegrounds and be more annoying than they are already. Mechs every game would be a worse meta than having fatboys that are vulnerable to poison.
---
If Lightfang is winning every game you're playing against slow players because the lightfang strategy can easily get aggro'd out.
---
Lol I meant that
---
Fixed

"Blessing of the Ancients" (2019, colorized)
---
NA manup#2508 trading 80g quest
---
Hearthstone now seems like a whole different game for me. ı almost forgot how Standart feels like lol.
---
You’re playing a relatively powerful deck at what I would assume are the lowest ranks if you’ve been gone for a year and a half. Not too unusual.
---
Choco#1508 80g quest trade NA. I'll show first, you go first.
---
Go for Golden Spawn of Nzoth and Baron Rivendare. It makes just about any board a top 3 finish.
