Well done, minion.

---
---
All these 5s And they still couldn‚Äôt do anything special for there 5th year of development 
---
As a big Diablo fan (and someone who's never played WoW), I'd be very in to this. Not sure how the WoW fans would feel though.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
How about a whole new game with the same mechanics based on Diablo or Starcraft? New classic set - start from scratch. Sure it would mean more collecting (and money spending) and would split some of the player base but I'd totally get in to either of those games.
---
I highly doubt that they would create a whole brand new game and split up the player based that much when they could just add it to hearthstone. Especially if it's the same mechanics and same style.
---
&gt;  I really hope we have real aggro decks viable next expansion
---
What game are you playing?
---
Every spell in rogue is overpriced because Prep exists
---
On that note - can we get the expansion icons to be a little bit darker on the cards? Or am the only one that can never make them out behind the text? I have no idea what anything's from unless it has little/no text over the icon
---
Could've posted this with a custom card and passed it off as an expansion leak :^)
---
Now time to wait 5 days for doctor booms teaser and another 5 days for raffam‚Äôs teaser.. amazing marketing move blizz kill the hype before there‚Äôs anything to be hyped about 
---
So fucking cool! 
---
just make a dummy alt account and use it to do the quests if u really need to be efficient and dont have time to do quests in real games
---
It *should* be classic. Instead there‚Äôs fucking Lightwell for a 2 drop. 
---
This would be such an overpowered expansion! 
---
Legend requires a significant time investment beyond playing the games for quests assuming your win rate is not above 60 percent
---
Dat Humongous ~~ass~~ errr... Razorleaf
---
My ocd won‚Äôt let me do that. I‚Äôd have to bow develop two accounts.
---
I probably could have worded that better :)
---
Meh, if I somehow want wild cards back somewhere down the road I‚Äôll just fork out $100 to craft some stuff. I‚Äôve been playing for years and haven‚Äôt paid a penny anyways. 
---
Go back and look at the beginnings of expansion trailers when it‚Äôs flipping through all the cards. For some reason they just give all of them the warlock border.
---
My end of season rewards was a golden surrender to madness.  Time to see if Mojo and Surrender are worthwhile come April.
---
hdub #11725 
---
NA 80g trade, i can show but you go first
---
If given the chance, a player will min max the fun out of any game.
---
Yeah, you're probably right. The idea of from-scratch collection would be cool but really I'd love it either way. But like I said, I also don't play WoW and I know fans of that might feel very differently.
---
Oh ok Ill look through em
---
Honestly, not going to miss them. Hopefully they learned the lesson and from now on the card power level will be reasonable.
---
I would disagree with some cards on this lost for example, quests that arent priest, warrior and rogue. Spell stones that arent druid, priest and warlock, the legendary weapons that arent rogue, paladin, mage and warlock. There just seems to be a lot of clutter 
---
It's most likely an archetype called Mind Blast Priest or Clone Priest. The full deck list isn't there, so I can't tell you which in particular.
---
My dad does at least 30 a day and plays wild, almost exclusively meme priest decks, and is happily playing away at rank 15 laughing his ass off, I admire it tbh I get wayy to frustrated
---
You'd still get done faster if you just do 0-3 mana cards, nothing but triggers and cycle, and concede/requeue the instant you run out of cards.
---
This has literally zero support but it's a pretty decent payoff. I wouldn't be surprised if it became playable just like Vilefin Inquisitor did once more neutral murlocs were introduced.
---
They just said notable, not viable, not tier 1, they included every legendary quest, weapon, spellstone, and death knight. Meme cards, nerfed cards, and much discussed cards as well. I don't think there's any cards that straight up aren't notable in this picture.
---
PAINTINGS?!? YOU FUCKING PAINTED THIS?!? Holy fuck dude this is crazy.
---
He be acting Kel‚Äôthu‚ÄôFreakin‚ÄôRad but now he feels like Kel‚Äôthu‚ÄôFreakin‚ÄôWack.
---
I apologize for sharing this.
---
It's not about the win rate. It's about the horrible feeling it gives you if you are playing control against it. I very, very seldom get tilted. I really am not invested in ranking up or anything. If I lose, oh well. But playing against mill rogue as control is really infuriating, and does feel tiliting. It's not just losing - that happens all the time. It's a combination of losing very slowly and inevitably and not getting a chance to play my cool stuff. That's what sucks.
---
EhSlashEh#1725 NA
---
The list is notable cards, not viable cards, the quests, weapons, heroes, and to a lesser extent are all pretty notable. 
---
To be fair, Dragon is a tribe ... Raven and Mammoth are not lol 
---
I didn't know he was added to WoW, so it's more "originally from" hearthstone
---
I started playing a few weeks before Un'Goro hit. It really welcomed me into Hearthstone and WoW. That expansion is still my favourite and will always have a place in my heart, gonna miss it.
---
Ehhhhh, it's an awfully strong 2 drop for classic IMO. It's enabled a ton of degenerate Priest combos.
---
Discord dude. Or look on hearthpwn.
---
You can find stuff, stop asking everyone to do your work for you.
---
I can tell you're a combo/control player....
---
What the hell is a treespeaker?
---
Ok wait, First warlock played galvanizer before he gets mecha'thun in hand? Isn't that almost certain loss even without discarding it? 
---
[Come on OP, the real list is much more concise, only 1 card is notable](https://imgur.com/a/1IyBNbf)
---
After the long walk on the beach + big dicks
---
Helps if you curses spread longer than a mile
---
At rank 20, sure. 
---
No, you made the right play. Zandalari Templar only gains Taunt as a Battlecry, which would only trigger if played from the hand, meaning it would have just been a 4/4 minion he could ignore. Furthermore, playing Mindgames means you wouldn't kill the 3/1, so even if Zandalari Templar was a 4/4 Taunt and only got +4/+4 from the "restore 10 Health" prerequisite, you still would have died anyways from the 3/1 and 1/1 trading with it and then taking 5 damage from Uther and 1 damage from the final Recruit.
---
Uninstall and play Artifact instead, cause you don't know how to "Hearthstone" correctly .. 
---
To "Hearthstone" correctly don't complain about RNG, you don't play "hearthstone" it plays with you .. 
---
I like it
---
We'll all be poor after the expansion!
---
It's actually fun being bad, I never play any Baku decks at ranks 20-17.
---
a frog and a tree? GG man. there's no hope for you
---
Looks so real man! Feels like I‚Äôm in the naxx dungeon XD
---
It‚Äôs super fun once every 10 games when you get to go ham but less satisfying during the other nine games where you‚Äôre getting blown out. 
---
Aren't these posts banned @mods?
---
Somehow, I have been treading water with it at rank 5-4. Which is the best it has ever been for this deck for me. Can out-value control, can mess with some combo decks, can survive aggro with decent draw. 
---
Probably 
---
A misplay is a move that costs you the game. This move didn‚Äôt cost him the game. He had no chance regardless.
---
I recently played from 5 to legend and I didn‚Äôt face a single big priest, the few priests I played were some sort of dragon otk variant. There‚Äôs also as many odd hunters as mech hunters bizarrely. You‚Äôre also forgetting kings bane and odd rogue which are everywhere

More accurately, I think the Priest identity has to do with ‚ÄúCombo‚Äù (no, not the keyword). A lot of priest cards kind of need another card otherwise they don‚Äôt really do much. OP sort of nails it by explaining how Priests don‚Äôt have a lot of proactive non-situational cards, but that‚Äôs also why Priests tend to ‚Äúpass turn‚Äù a lot. 
---
No, its driving me mad. I almost want to recreate it organized by class.

It sounds like you might be interested in the 3 class approach. Where you only play 3 classes and dust everything else. I don't do this, but I hear you get 3 really solid decks.

Do not hesitate to look outside the game client. For example, there are threads on reddit (the competitive one I think) to find game partners. Another way is to go on a twitch stream and offer a few games on the chat. I have made a few online friends looking for ¬´¬†tournament¬†¬ª practice.
---
Traded with  GamingDead#2151  Nice guy
---
Haha true.. very true... but the pressure. 
---
mechanics say otherwise. if i remember correctly, an after play phase is applied to the transformed minion, thus the actual order of played minions being faceless then the rhino.
---
i maybe wrong, bt OP's result is consistent with my point
---
Odd pala to rank 5. Good for you what a momentous achievement. Don't @ me with your circle jerk of bs just down vote 
---
Because you lose a ton of tempo later. I think you have tempo and aggro confused.
---
Peoplw play priest because the class is busted and requires no mindgames or thinking. Have you ever seen priest run out of cards in hand? That tells something. How about g8ve love to shaman or rogue??
---
So many of the most broken cards are finally rotating out. No more deathrattle combo BS. No more "you have a board I can't remove but I can anyway" (aka psychic scream). No more Dire mole into Crackling Razormaw into coin flanking strike. No more DK infinite value BS. No more spellstone BS. No more "I discover a taunt that's either Tirion, Lich king or Tarim". No more cards like Primordial Glyph or Shadow visions that discovers an additional copy of the spell you need and that you already have in your deck. No more stupid druid card. No more mushroom power. No more 3mana fireball. No more turn 2 keleseth! I'm going to miss a few cards but honestly this set rotation is going to be a real breath of fresh air!
---
I'd agree if the guy didn't have Shadowstep. Getting a potential +2+2 literally twice as good as the already overpowered Keleseth buff and well worth the coin. 
---
If you honestly think the top deck in a card game will ever not be a "pay2winner" then you should probably go play uno, you have better odds there
---
Yeah but you will rage on priest again in the expansion after next one when priest keeps accumulating more good cards. It happened the last 3 years it'll happen again.
---
A basic priest deck can win oddpaladin (example) that tells me something about balancing.
---
Good idea, nerf Basic and Classic more becaus there is a good meta for the card which is very easy to play around. Good idea, I agree. Also we could nerf Fireball to 8 mana and Nortshire Cleric to 6 mana
---
Wow
---
Do you even hear what nonsense are you talking? You are saying about Priest which is a Control class type that is a braindead class?
---
Excuse me but I don‚Äôt understand the way you are thinking, it is clear that Priest always has cards in hand if it is a Control class, only an aggro deck runs out of cards in hand. And Priest is not a class that was made for playing aggro.
---
Ye i forgot priestmains are literally 50% of HS income for blizzard. Its not like priest w/l is higher than other classes Kappa
---
**Unpopular opinion incoming:**
---
Honestly I'd want the opposite. I want them to remove classes so that they can better focus on balancing the others. The more classes, the harder it is to balance them.
---
Now what classes to remove? I'd remove Priest and Shaman. The former has been annoying to play against for a long time and the latter just hasn't a great class identity. The hero power isn't that great and I don't think Overload is a great class identity. (If anything, all classes could get spells with overload.)

Usually after playing a really crazy game in unranked people would add you. Like for example a game where you are giving each other cool cards and play a bunch off yogg's. If you're playing on EU you could just add me tho

Really wish instead of how standard worked, they would make a system where every year of, one or two old sets were part of the standard with the new sets they'd make. Could actually use my old stuff rather then avoid wild like I do now
---
Espionage Rogue with azalina, take my upvote 
---
The classic team vs team setup is
---
1st: Villains gather and do something. (Usually a theft, terror act, assassination)
---
2nd: Heroes gather and plan to counterstrike (if they strike here, they fail)
---
3rd: Final battle
---
Solid pun. 5/10

goodbye every warlock card I hated together with cube. 
---
cubelock was annoying
---
Here's a DisguisedToast video about that interaction:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zotCRXe22tc
---
The summary of it, though, is that it's like Silencing a regular minion (e.g. removes buffs/debuffs and Freeze effects), as opposed to muffling the opponent like in the Lich King Priest fight.
---
Is there any reward for getting all classes to 60? I'm one level off with paladin but without rewards I'm too lazy :) 
---
The difference is, they don't want more deckslots. 
---
(And there is some truth to the downside they fear.)
---
Also if they plan for at least 5 more years of hearthstone and the switch is still rather young it could be a reasonable decision that could pay off and broaden their audience/ make part of their current audience happier. 
---
I don't own a switch btw. 
---
Priest
---
Nothing worse than when priest is meta.
---
Combo priest is good against Control (obviously) but also aggro, since they have 4 STRONG boardclears atm. (M)Ass hysteria + Psychic Scream completely lock you out of the game from turn 5 onward.
---
Some don't even need those, because they have duskbreaker instead.
---
Not to mention how Shadow visions allow for ridiciolous consistency.
---
But with all those control tools, it's just a matter of time before they run out of them right?
---
Wrong.
---
Priest is the new druid bois. Insane control tool to ensure survival, coupled with a OTK combo in some way, either Maly + Velen that gets revived for the 3rd time, or any big taunt that get's to stick just smacks you for 50+ damage in the face.
---
Honestly I've always hated priest, their cards are really powerfull and they just seem to get completely out of hand somethings.
---
I think it's time for a r/fuckpriest sub.
---
Nice catch! I might do a second thread. The arts are sooo interesting to watch. :)

---
Yep, also true. :-)
---
It's sad that value becomes rarely critical these days. It's either combo assembling the whole game and getting opponent from 30 to 0 or infinite value combos. Back in the day you counted your opponent's big hitters, Executes and Shield Slams and didn't draw any cards.
---
Warlock (broken hero power), Priest (unfun to play against), Shaman (lack of interesting identity).
---
Wow dude, you got quite a few meta decks, nice. I find it hard believe that you felt that you would have a hard time before. Good job. 
---
I lack a lot of those cards in my collection and yes, I can try to dust my cards to craft something better, but I want to keep all my cards no matter how useless they may be. [[ Gurubashi Offering ]], I'm looking at you. I might be able to do it with my midrange hunter(without rexxar). So I'll try to do it casually.

Now I'm curious to see your deck list. 
---
I've been lucky so far. I tend to add people with whom I had fun, long, really lucky or awesome combo decks... That way you end up talking with people that care about playing and not about leddering...
---
Those sad people that are just sad show it in the duration of the game, just trolling, emoting, roping and being asses no matter if they win or loose.

If you craft a card and keep it, you basically get a free wild card. If you craft a card, get the refund and disenchant it, you get some extra dust.
---
I don't hate this. Kinda like an add on to the tutorial maybe 
---
Fair enough!
---
Nice, not often you see the card art.  
---
Where can one go to explore more card art, and from other sets to?
---
decklist? anything with azalina is a deck for me
---
Could easily be a new mage hero tbh, or new legendary card different from last times one. 
---
Hs wikipedia.
---
Deck mode? Super boring and would be over after a week.
---
That makes it a great tavern brawl however. 
---
Yeah it could but these 3 classes are for me the ones that rarely get different ones.
---
Who needs the deathrattle anyway?
---
Oh right! Stupid me that didn't check he had the Death Knight!! Thanks!
---
Good bot
---
It's nothing special. Just a bunch of steal cards a bit of draw and academic espionage, probably rather greedy deck list actually. He just couldn't really deal dmg to me so healing 2 for around 6-7 turns was good enough
---
because darkkmane is a legend
---
Fair, I guess it's depends what you're after. But usually a good way of learning the game is by taking a strong, easy-to-pilot deck. It masks some of your mistakes just from its powerlevel, allows to reach some higher ranks for better rewards and gives you an understanding of what makes a good deck. If you're crafting a legend-viable deck you'll at least never run into the trap of spending all your limited resources and then realizing that you can't get past rank 17 with your Ysera deck no matter what.
---
Feels kinda weird that the best thing to happen to this game in a long time is a bunch of cards leaving the game (or part of the game). 
---
The battlecry of the Devilsaur is not active.

It was a fin card, sometimes a win condition on its own but it wasmt great. After ungoro it rarely made the cut and usually its more of a fill in when you have a slot left.
---
Would love to see more like it it wasnt too op and yet a very fun card
---
What are you HIDING? 
---
Is there a chance to play with Neutral decks? Some card games have the option of doing so, but is it viable in Hearthstone to run one?
---
Lol, yup, that's pretty accurate. Obviously not EVERY game, but ... Anyway, so when is Hearthstone Switch coming out?
---
Kill Command art is drawn for the TCG by the artist of Penny Arcade, which was quite popular webcomic at the time. While the style may not fit HS, especially given the direction the art has gone since the initial release that Kill Command was a part of, it is still a good looking card. He did Leeroy Jenkins and Master Jouster as well.
---
Spell hunter with zuljin and rexxar will easily do this. Rexxar will just out grind the lich kings. The only minion you can consider running is mossy horror for his turn 7 frostmourne 
---
Deathstalker Rexxar, you were my favorite, farewell my friend
---
Day 9 and Ben Brode played of each other cause they were both really upbeat people .. Now its probably going to be Regis 
---
IM GONNA DO IT JERRY I SWEAR TO GOD IM GOING TO DO IT
---
Me.. It'd have been nice to open them.. but who's gonna craft them with dust ;)
---
god i miss this card. This was my favourite card of all time. Nothing else has filled this role for me. Need a new giant hard to summon minion
---
I crafted the paladin one. Can't say I regret it, since it was pretty fun while it lasted. 
---
And points 2 and 3, I don‚Äôt have a switch but they do have a touchscreen so it would just be like a gaming tablet and you already do stuff like merging your twitch account, Sony account or hsreplay account to Blizzard.
---
Ja ist mir auch passiert blo√ü hab ich den mage gespielt;)....
---
I opened the Hunter quest and crafted the Shaman quest when Un'goro came out. Those are the only ones I've played, apart from single-player content and brawls.
---

Trading 80g quest. Yours first.
---
Welp
---
Malygos , because he brings a whole different archetype to the game all on his own, if there wasn‚Äôt malygos everyone would play aggro/Mid-Range mINions beatdown decks
---
He's a proper lad.
---
Manchmal ist man lucky, manchmal unkucky^^
---
Jade Idol
---
OH GOD....WHAT HAVE I DONE.....
---
That is crazy good. nicely done
---
Personally, I think you‚Äôre reaching a bit. This feature will have little to no impact on Hearthstone.
---
Dusting a legendary will only give you 400 dust, which you can use to craft a single epic. Not worth it IMO, I'd rather buy packs from new expansion to get cards you can actually play on standard.
---
Bloodbraid Elf. 
---
Actual answer is probably Genn or Sunkeeper Tarim. 
---
I like to play off-meta decks too. I like to experiment with different decks and create anti-meta decks, but I don't see the problem with net-decking. In fact, the more consistency there is in my opponents' decks, the easier it is to create decks that tech against them.
---
In my opinion, the ladder compensates for people who want to be creative and jank and people who want to net deck and win. If you net-deck good decks you'll rise through the ranks away from people who want to try out new and interesting decks. If my home-brews are good I'll still climb the ladder and continue to beat decks.
---
But people who want to be creative and win need to understand that they still need to beat the meta. We can't complain when we create weird janky combos and get obliterated by odd paladin.
---
If the issue is you want to play your homebrews against other people homebrews, then your best bet is playing against friends; maybe friend people on ladder or casual who are playing creative decks. Because yea most people netdeck strong decks.
---
I dunno if controversial. But blood of the ancient one is my favourite card of all time
---
and very handsome
---
Good idea that could work. Even though even experienced players are not necessary good at organising their decks in a comfortable manmet. I would hope not too many people would complain about that change if they are below the required win amount. 
---
B
---
Regis said it was practically impossible to find out what the title will be. The 5 villains might give themselves a team name, and that'll be in the title of the expansion. Or it might includes Rafaam's name! 
---
Ugh, two combo-heavy brawls in a row? Hope I don't get a Tavern Brawl quest this week, 'cause I'm not playing it.
---
Eyyyye Seeeee Youuuuuuu
---
This is my first tavern brawl finally it is come back!
---
Ends the trailer with "It is time to begin!"
---
Doesn't announce the new expansion 
---
These guys certainly deserve each other. 
---
üèÖ
---
Could be Friday.
---
And you thought turn 3 Coin + Barnes was broken
---
Such a cool character. Such an awful card.
---
I would guess Friday
---
RegisKillbin joked "I know all about Villains of Violet Hold" in a stream. Don't think he'd take that chance if that was real, so sadly it seems unlikely, cool as that title is. 
---

Decklist pleaseee!! Xoxo
---
I know I was hoping he would turn up before the leak, but I wasn't sure, since the majority of the others were so recent.
---
Glad to see they're showing love to older content too.
---
Alternative take on the expansion title with alliterations: Rafaam's Revenge.
---
gigglings main issue was not really itself but it was good bounce defense for quest and could be played twice with valeera aswell, but thats more due quest design itself being issue. and odd and even. at 6mana wouldve been fine but at 7 even decks cant use it so went to that.
---
And still a better nerf wouldve been (imo) made only 1 annoy a tron but increase its stats.
---
Okay. I have a better idea of your view. Makes sense. I guess it also makes sense to me to split up this particular round of reveals, one villain per video, with a new card each time. The format just fits with split videos. 
---
But yes, I get it. I can see how many people would probably prefer to see it all at once.
---
I regret crafting warrior's quest. Its such a stupid coinflip every time.
---
Am I the only one that is not excited with these teasers at all. I don't know Rafaam or any WOW charecters I'll be hyped when I see the cards.
---
Last weeks brawl was not combo heavy... it was basically spirit of the shark rogue then everything else. And spirit of the shark rogue is not combo it relies on minions hitting face. 
---
I really love The Darkness! It's fun to smack him down and watch people struggle when spending hard removal. If you can sneak him out early you can play other big minions and force the opponent to use hard removals, knowing that if you can stall long enough they have no answer to The Darkness. Or the other way around, they have to keep that polymorph in hand the entire game in fear of the Darkness. It's way too slow and easily countered by just holding on to a hard removal card, but I really like it and it has given me some fun wins in control decks (especially in mech warrior for some reason)
---
Don¬¥t think so cuz they made New Year announcement at Thursday, the new format announecement also at Thursday so yeah... But who knows, right? :-)
---
They gave us leaked images yesterday of the trailer they just released a few minutes ago.
---
Huh, that's actually a nice twist, given that I was expecting him to be another villain. Didn't expect Rafaam to be the mastermind. 
---
This is the most drawn out reveal ever.
---
Made a Buff Paladin deck with Silver Swords - easy win though combo decks will arise soon
---
Dr. Boom also didn't have a giant mech to push buttons around in from World of Warcraft or Goblins vs Gnomes.
---
Ragnaros didn't have a holy shield to use when he turned into a Lightlord.
---
Stylistic makeovers are not to be a massive surprise when we see a new rendition of a character, is it? If anything the jewel makes me think it's more likely to be Rafaam, because that jewel has the same icon in it as the card he is holding. Which implies that he took something from them and wants more, or *they took something from him that he wants back.*
---
All you Standard players are about learn about the sweet love-making that is Barnes. 
---
I never did. Picked up the game late September so had no prior access to any of the sets. I opened just enough packs to get my free legendary and it wasn't a quest :-)
---
Oh my god can you imagine the backlash if that's true? Boy oh boy would that get some goats. 
---
My guess is that Zayle is actually some kind of legendary artefact that Rafaam is after and it is garded in the Violet Hold.
---
i dont really mind the nerf to much  but i do miss his old voiceline(and i think he should have charge or rush when from hand but then its kind of breaks shudderwock so &gt;.&gt;)
---
Teasers got pushed every 2 days since begining. 
---
Is somone else wondering why all this villains are tolerated by the inkeeper.
---
In Wispers of the old gods we saw that the fortune teller is in inkeeper's tavern. And now this is probably the same room (looks similar).
---
Why gests do not react at all?  
---
Cool but relatively horrible. PLEASE NOT SO MUCH RNG BLIZZ
---
Despite all the negativity going around, these teasers have me genuinely hyped for the expansion! I can't wait for the offical announcement!
---
You got 6 5+ cost spells too wow
---
the triangle on the card made me think there was a warframe riven mod in the pic 
---
Deck list? :)
---
Congrats! I have a lot of trouble completing the Lich King fights. Just out of curiosity did you net-deck? 
---
True, but Rafaam is already a Hearthstone original character. Would be weird for a big redesign, but like I said I'd love for it to actually be Rafaam. 
---
This is the discolock dream... That never happens 
---
So this isn't just a mobile wifi problem? I mostly play on mobile, but occasionally I play on PC and don't have these problems when I do.
---
New Expansion : The League of Villains
---
That'd be awesome 
---
Hope you held onto them for the nerfs 
---
My android phone is 2 years old and runs hearthstone perfectly fine, with sounds. Every iPhone I've had wouldn't be able to finish a full game of hearthstone without losing 30% of its battery after 2 years. 
---
Psl tell me where you struggle and maybe i can help you. 
---
I think it's Rafaam and that their mission will be to break Zayle out of prison. That would make sense with the solo content where you get Zayle for completing the adventure.
---
Dont have the decklists anymore. Tell me which class and i will find my list 
---
I love how the comments on the previous teaser was doom and gloom, but this one's tone has changed dramatically.
---
The power of Rafaam.
---
It costs 19.99$ and I will buy it, you probably know about whizbang,  Zayle will be like that, I guess what I'm saying is: if you like singleplayer content, and you find Zayle to be a good card, then you should, then otherwise, you can buy the wings whenever you have gold to spare. 
---
[removed]
---
These are all hearthstone characters.  Rafaam, hagatha, and tog were all created for the game, and boom is much more significant for hs than wow
---
U LATE YOU F**** NOo-
---
wait I Have no arthas.  Congrulations dude
---
Kingsbane is one of the only decks I've ever gone out of my way to craft. Having a giant 13 attack sword that can never be permanently removed feels great. And at the time it constantly healed you back to full, letting you fight 8+ attack minions with your hero alone. It was awesome.
---
True, that does make sense and also sounds cool. Would love that. 
---
even if priest is bad its always the msot anoying to go against. Entomb,potion of maddness, physisc scream(hate it escpially if i play living mana),drakanoid operative,shadowmaddnes and mind control not common at all(except in arena) but annoying to go against. Also i hate anduin.
---
Harbinger Celestia /s
---
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
---
Hah, thanks for being willing to engage in further discussion.
---
This post is a symptom of the above-mentioned frustration. (My frustration, lol).
---
Agreed. I totally get why it needed to get nerfed, but it was by far my most loved deck of all time. It coupled the deck-building fun and variance of matches of Reno decks with a high power level.
---
She‚Äôs fucking jacked 
---
Hopefully tomorrow, but I don't wanna set myself for disappointment.
---
I can't believe how hyped I am for the return of RAFAAM, THE SUPREME ARCHAELOGIST
---
Congrats friend. Feelsgood 
---
Yea.. but I wasn't particularly interested in any of them either..   ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 
---
Hagatha is going to be nuts. Best value bomb in standard after rotation.
---
Fair enough. :)
---
I believe that's lethal
---
Rafaam is Reynauld confirmed
---
Let the deck copy+pasting begin
---
I‚Äôm down for this
---
Thank you, however I don‚Äôt understand when you said cards tied to the account
---
Well, someone who did theory about Rafaam being the one behind all this was right.
---
I am sp00ked.
---
Pretend leaking the name of the expansion has been a running joke on his stream
---
You either die as an unplayed card, or get played enough to see yourself become the villain.
---
Hooktusk rogue is already really good the big problem is you have to find the Hooktusk.  If you play her on curve it is generally a GG play.  If you never find her in the deck pirate tempo rogue just feels like you have to make suboptimal plays.  If they added a tutor where you like "Draw the highest cost pirate" or something to get her in a consistent fashion then yeah she'd break the game.
---
Thank you, I already did it
---
I'll be honest. With Lich King rotating out + "There must always be a Lich King" + Villians themed expansion I was 100% sure the Lich King would be involved. Oh well...
---
Deathstalker Rexxar, I just really fucking love crafting Zombeasts.
---
*It is time... to begin*
---
After this two day break first, of course.
---
0 interest.... CARD REVEALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
---
I mean on my computer I play with a mouse. I wasn't aware that I was doing the impossible all this time as I HAD to be using a touch screen.
---
Credit cards for purchases 
---
Jesus I thought it was over after just the first turn but it KEPT GOING. 
---
You're some kinda degenerate OP. I hope you enjoyed using all your good RNG on this game instead of the new set. 
---
Hope it gets to keep the same VA, it doesn't sound the same as the one on League of Explorers. Zul'jin sounds weird compared to the VA it got on Heroes of the Storm.
---
Word. I'm still in favor of the frostbolt+fireball puzzles. 
---
I thought they confirmed Zayle is a woman.
---
No. They were "enabled to be good" because people started to include them in decks and realise how easy Priest can use burst and how insanely powerful 1 mana kill anything is.
---
*whistles*
---
Now can we all agree that 'the eye' is a reference to Raffam's Egyptian-like archaeology, and this this expansion will have nothing to do with Dalaran/Violet Hold?
---
The League of Supreme Archaeology
---
Duskfallen Aviana
---
I just lost on one of my accounts on arena. I was going to clear the board with holy nova and got disconnected and lost.
---
On my other account I'm currently 7-0.  That is the best I've done without taking a loss and there is no way I'm going to finish that session on mobile.
---
I like your final reveal card, I think I will **TAKE IT**
---
What is the scam? Enter battle tag and password for free packs?
---
Captain Hooktusk seems almost a given.
---
Countess Ashmore also seems like she'd be a lot better.
---
I agree. It creates decisions turn by turn, because your then starts trying to apply pressure. So you have to decide if you can withstand the tempo loss each turn.
---
divine spirit / inner fire combo on mosh'ogg enforcer.  You want Doomsayers to play on turn 7 exactly though.
---
Yeah, the upgraded hero powers have been an issue since Justicar was released. I had no idea odd rogue would be so good though. Turns out a 2/2 dagger is much better on turn 2 than turn 7 with justicar. But they really should have made the upgraded hero powers more equal. Control was in a worse place back then, but still.
---
Throwing a question out there...
---
People naming these cards, do you also love them *When you play a different deck and your opponent plays them against you*?
---
Because yeah, people love broken OP shit when they're the one inflicting the pain on their opponent. But to love a card, I think you need to be fine with your opponent doing it to you as well.
---
Well, here's hoping that they keep that trend up!
---
¬´¬†Is this lethal?¬†¬ª
---
I don't know about you guys, but I kinda like Patches the Pirate and the whole pirate package in general. So great seeing him pop out his cannon..!
---
SMALL
---
I won a ton of games in ranked.  it said I was rank 10.  I've won the rewards before.  but this time, it didn't give me anyway.  I'm wondering if it's because I waited so long to check back into game?
---
I wouldn't say Star Aligner wasn't controversial. It was only talked about due to the "Druid is too combo-reliant" craze that ti was in during Boomsday and early Rumble.
---
It's been a significant amount of time, but at one point it was hated pretty unanimously. Granted, Warlock in general was pretty hated.
---
The deal 2 damage draw, +5 armor draw, weapons project + that belongs in a mueseum for 3, the draw for eached damaged minion, i usually get through it pretty fast
---
This Game perfectly shows why the warlock quest is useless
---
Hard agree. Grim patron warrior meta was fun as hell.
---
There is an extension for Hearthstone Deck Tracker.
---
Midrange Hunter is a T1 deck  You can check Vicious Syndicate for the latest meta report but honestly I'd wait  Entire meta turns upside down in a month and whole archetypes will be unplayable in Standard.
---
Cant wait for it
---
I played it in Spiteful Druid and it wasn't too bad. You could get an extra Spiteful, an extra 10/10 charger (from Druid of the Claw's cat form), two 10/10 taunts with Saronite (pre-nerf), an extra 10/10 Lich King, etc.
---
It seemed like it made you dumpster control decks even harder, but struggle even more against aggro. I could see it being in a "greedy secondary deck" for Specialist format, if Spiteful Druid was still a thing.
---
## U N I T Y
---
no, its not wifi, its the game or the game's servers
---
It is a tempo deck, having a dead cart until late game will be game over
---
I also got my first golden hero recently! Although for me it was Warlock. Spammed zoo for the last 50 games so the wins/losses would be quicker
---
Erm.. u can click on their hero portrait and then click on the speech bubble that comes out. Viola. Muted.
---
Rather than "Is there anyone?" it might be that they want people to start given how they're going with Adventures now.
---
They want you to be invested in the plot since that's essentially the bulk of what you're supposedly paying for now since cards are essentially off the table.
---
Kind of awkward to watch if you play some of the other card games that have had free story modes and have been improving them to the point they're worth being invested in at that, but it is what it is.
---
Not OP but I used Murlocs and killed him before turn 7 Frostmourne
---
The "Hearthstone" set is being rotated out
---
I'm not sure what your point is.
---
If it's "Even without yogg, we still lose to pure chance" then yes I agree, and I also believe they should take out a lot of cards/archetypes that win/lose by pure chance. Yogg was probably the prime example of that though.
---
Warlock
---
The old gods don't pay in coin, and even fortunetellers have to eat.
---
If you're right, how do you explain the fact that Dr. Boom (original version from GvG) would be hit by [[Sacred Trial]] if you had another minion on the board already? The battlecry happens, boom bots are summoned, and THEN Boom hits the board and is thus removed by ST.

1/-/- | Secret: After your opponent has at least 3 minions and plays another, destroy it.  
---
Grats. welcome to the club
---
Yeah but if they  ever want to do some wonky hero power stuff like that again,  T H E D E S I G N S P A C E
---
Well, the game has changed a lot since those days. It is a good leg, but not one to be considered the best anymore.
---
The nerf was so ridiculous too I would've preferred just banning Warsong like most tcgs do, it was like "ooo a hyper competitive deck,,,,, lets make it a meme"
---
Shaman #1, baby!
---
Thanks man
---
RIP DoomTurtle
---
Yes please.
---
Shadowverse and Eternal both allow you to minimise with no issue.
---
Hearthstone is also slow and laggy on my phone while the others I've mentioned aren't. I don't know enough about these things to say why, but if the other two can run really smoothly whats up with Hearthstone?
---
yeah, but I play on mobile
---
Ah, I don't remember that. 
---
There's a lot I hated in warlock, but never cared much about Rin, even when I played control. I think my deck got destroyed like 3 times ever, over hundreds of games in that era. And I may have won some of these anyway, with cards in hand.
---
I hated/hate cube and Skull of the Man'ari, but didn't care about Rin.
---
my disconnect rates are highest on Wifi....Cellular is far more stable for me.
---
I will try it, but what other cards would be good in the deck? Drawing or what?
---
Time to get like 5 cards revealed, then have to wait like 2 weeks for more reveals. The level of blue balls we will have this reveal cycle is unmatched
---
yeah, but I don't want to do that every time. they could easily implement an auto-mute in the options
---
Jade Druid was fun until they got the nut draw and their tokens were larger than your on curve midrange minions.
---
Pogo hopper+ lab recruiter+ Elvin minstrel+ lots of spells
---
Trinkets and baubles, paid for in blood
---
Nice
---
yo for real though, none of the characters are new, they've used the voodoo lady thing before with WoTOG, none of this sparks interest or meaning. I keep asking myself "Why should i care" each time they release these
---
I Just started the game and i'm gathering card for each class, which class should work best for early progression? i'm playing hunter and mage decks with the basic cards already given. thx in adv
---
Attacking a 1-1 to check for redemption and Noble sac, idea to pop egg then brawl next turn. If redemption is already ruled out, pop egg then brawl.
---
They haven't even yet announced the name of the expansion...
---
There'll be new card generation. Stonehill is honestly not even that good as Priest has only one class taunt.
---
[[The Darkness]]
---
Must be fun at parties

excuse me but wtf

Thanks!

&gt;  THE THING YOU LIKE IS WRONG AND ONLY MY WAY IS THE CORRECT WAY
---
This nibba really calling someone a sociopath cus they like RNG?
---
While this can often happen, I don't think that's what's happening with hearthstone. Hearthstone will restart after ~2 min away even if you're looking just at the main menu and switch to your ram-lite messaging app. It also doesn't take up that much ram in the first place (to necessitate being closed because you're out of ram), maybe 500 mb, and phones nowadays have 4+ gb  of ram. 
---
I think it's a deliberate decision or a deficiency in the game engine. Hearthstone actions are asynchronous between players. If you ever switch from hearthstone in-game during your opponent's and switch back, you'll notice all your opponent's actions are queued up and played when you return. You literally won't miss a single action your opponent has taken. So my guess is blizzard avoids having too many actions queued up and played (updating the client to match the server side state) by kicking you off hearthstone via a timer that happens to be around the length of a turn. 
---
Lemme know what you think, this is all conjecture lol.
---
Source: have a cs degree but don't know jack about game development
---

---
I remember his cheesecake baking video but not the game it was supposed to be promoting
---
4. It goes like this: Dr. Boom represents 2014 and so on...
---
Heh. Yeah, one of the things that will make me salty is getting queued into the exact same deck that I just lost to.
---
still hope its a violet hold expansion and they bring back alot more enemys from old hs expansion
---
kt could be in violet hold and maybe he is the last card
---
Yup Thursday seems to be the day usually
---
you need the id number
---
If you want to climb, you need to netdeck. It's just a part of the reality of living in a day and age where it's trivially easy to find out which decks are the best in a given meta.
---
so far i think its been every other business day for the announcement 
---
believe it was Tues Thurs last week and this week has been Mon Wed, so hopefully things are pointing to the Friday  announcement for the full reveal.
---
I personally prefer this over brawliseum.
---
I just find it amazing that even this insane shit is slower than old Pirate Warrior before the nerfs. Disgusting as fuck RNG tho.
---
Thats exactly why people disliked it though. It was all the upside of a combo deck with none of the downside of requiring holding all of the pieces
---
Glad I could help! And yeah if I had even a single shield slam I would put it in lol
---
I had this really weird dream last night that hex lord malacrass for some reason was stupidly overpowered and broken. The thing is, in my dream he wasn't even his actual card, he was a 4 mana 2/2 and had a weird combination of really strong abilities in magic the gathering, something that did let you gain card advantage, but not by copying your starting hand and adding it to your hand.
---
I like how you called them "benefits"
---
Blizzard 2019: Turning slow rolling into an art!
---
I don't see that as being a problem so much as a response to a reality. People will netdeck regardless. Giving newbies an in-game tool to make it easier just helps to prevent new players from being steamrolled and helps them to fit gaps in their collection when they don't have enough to copy a top tier deck.
---
I like Baku. I realize that she makes the meat stale and such, but one of my favorite decks is odd dragon warrior
---
with 0 skill involved, lot less fun for the opponent, no way to play around it. 
---
"anyway i play mid range hunter atm"
---
that is tier 1 sir
---
Hear, hear. We're in the part of the cycle where people complain about literally everything. Be patient. Once we start getting card reveals, the tone will shift.
---
I have a few of them. I hated playing against Taunt warrior back during Un'Goro, when I was a budget player. Then played it a bit at the end of Witchwood once I got a better job and had more money for the game. 
---
I was the same as you, valuing dust for cards that weren't so niche. I regret having not given them more of a chance when it was their time to shine, but now I think you're not missing anything. 
---
Mass Hysteria would be more hilarious though.
---
The darkness isnt even close. Its not hard to summon. You play it and wait. And the reward is pretty eh.
---
Won my 3 games for my quest by playing Maly Shaman and got lucky enough to not face against any of the flamewaker/exodia cheese.
---
Or you go ham on one weapon if you got their hero card and tess in hand, just to mess with them.
---
The problem isn't netdecks, per se. The problem is that the best decks are either hyper-aggro or combo. I feel like the game has been missing good midrange representation for the last year.
---
They pretty much did since this is all obnoxious combo decks too.
---
No he's referring to Juicy Psychmelon.
---
Magma Rager?! Why would you reveal that card?
---
This is exactly why I never play with Wifi on, it's almost always better to just use your phone service, even at lower data rates like 1 or 2g. 
---
Not saying "sux 4 u", just agreeing that it is a very real issue, but at least there is a way around it.
---
Oh, no...
---
I used it in Quest Druid using recruit effects to get cheap 5-attack minions out so that Splintergraft and other big minions are free. It's not really viable against the most aggressive decks in this format, but there's something really rewarding about playing UI and dropping five huge minions for free the same turn. 
---
Now imagine what it would be like if some people got their wish to have Blizzard sell complete collections. 
---
lol I like the art work (looks more like a MTG card) but really what is the point of demon's touch?  Seems like a bad way of going about deck thinning.
---
Agree 110% with hyena.  How mana wyrm got nerfed and not this guy is beyond me.  It's going to be a bigger problem post rotation as I'm quite sure midrange hunter has more than enough cards that won't rotate to make another midrange build while everyone else loses power (and yes hunter finally loses arguably the most frustrating card in the game, rexxar, but the deck will still remain good).
---
Marseille?  Lyons?  Je vais tout suite!
---
1. Scavenging Hyena does not need a change in any regard. Midrange Hunter is powerful, but Hyena is not a card the deck wants to play on two and combos with Tundra Rhino and Unleash the Hounds have been possible since the games official release and have not and is not breaking the game.
---
2. None of the options offered by Animal Companion are really worth four mana, and it would be awkward to give Hunter what is functionally a Choose One card.
---
3. Why don't we let the card reveals start coming out before we say Druid help?
---
4. Discard Warlock is an archetype that is unlikely to ever be made to work, and Demon's Touch isn't want the deck needs.
---
As per tradition, I have to rewatch [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPAsYTzi-iI) video. Thanks OP.
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
I‚Äôm always so sad wen every expansion they release a yogg copy, but it‚Äôs for a specific class, and it‚Äôs so much worse
---
Honestly, I wouldn't either, but it would also be a dangerous card to have around in case it highrolls really, really hard.
---
Pirate tempo rogue will feel much better post rotation.
---
In the original trailer for Whispers of the Old Gods, the fortune teller was shown to have tentacles briefly there as well. I think the fortune teller either is or is a servant of one of the old gods. 
---
Reno Jackson upon release, and in the gadgetzan era
---
I don't think that they will reveal first cards with only 2-3 weeks until expansion drops
---
I was expecting leeroy to be HOF this rotation, and the nerf to be reverted, but i was wrong 
---
Net decking is what ruins it, stupid internet.
---
the business 
---
Tempo mage is an auto win essentially if you have aluneth and keep it in your opening hand
---
Mind Control Tech. It gets so much hate, but I love it so much. I don't even care when it's played against me. It's just like, "ah ya got me!"
---
Evenlock still is very strong, gets so much professional play and also i used to to get from 10 to 5
---
Well it just depends...
---
Let's just say it takes 10 packs to get the legend from the old sets, keep in mind you could also get it on pack 1-9.  And let's say the average pack is worth 100 dust, and the pack with a legendary will be worth 420 gold (1 legendary, 4 epics).  
---
So 1,000 gold --&gt; get 10 packs --&gt; dust everything when expansion hits (assuming you have absolutely no interest in wild whatsoever) = 1320 dust
---
Do this for all 3 sets 
---
1320 * 3 = 3960 dust
---
Now let's say you just open 30 packs from newer expansions, and let's say you get a legend in that.  That would be 3320 dust (29*100)+(420).
---
So for pure "dust for dust" value, it technically is worth it.  However if you are positive you never wanna play wild, I guess it's just a personal call - since you could end up playing lots of cards you open from the sets that remain in standard.
---
On the other hand if you wanna play wild one day, you could end up using the legends you draw (which would make it easily worth it).
---
So more of a personal choice I guess.  If you see yourself playing this game for years then you probably will eventually wanna get into wild (many players do because they don't want their old cards to "go to waste" or constantly dust them).  On the other hand if you just prefer standard or may not see yourself playing long term, then it would be fair to skip this step.  
---
yes exactly how do i turn this thing off?!?!?!?!
---
I‚Äôm not the only one being judged.
---
I have a couple games that will save the game state and still be resumable, but they will slow the Android shell to a crawl if there isn't enough memory. They are probably poorly-designed, which is why they won't release memory. But this seems to suggest it's an option, at least.
---
And like others said, Hearthstone will need restarting even if I just minimize it and stare at the home screen for more than 15 seconds. My phone is shit, but still...

---
my first though
---
I.... crafted her on release. So I hope she is good too.
---
I could see that, yeah. The tricky part would be that Hearthstone hasn't created a huge number of heroes who are quite as memorable. They're definitely there, but usually the hero is "The Player", and while that's cool conceptually it's hard to present as a card (even though our track record against so many big-name villains is pretty impressive at this point.)  On that note, though: the League of Explorers (especially Reno and Elise but with Sir Finnley Mrrglton coming along as well) are a nice group of of Hearthstone characters (Brann Bronzebeard's not original to Hearthstone, but he could probably be grandfathered in; worked for Dr. Boom, after all.)
---
Beyond the League of Explorers, though, I could see the Witchwood monster hunters and Rikkar  (or even the Troll Champions) all getting some face time. I'd love to see Sergeant Sally in the mix, but there's nothing to suggest her.
---
Midrange hunters run dire frenzy and masters call. Both will be strong with zuljin.

New priest OTK:

---
2. Mindblast three times.
---
3. Steal Zul'jin
---
4. Profit

Hmm maybe it's my deck then because I've had no luck with mine, but to be fair I had to take out a legendary because I didn't have it.

But is Barnes a cancer card only in priest..... Hmmmm i wonder if its the priest cards that are the problem with Barnes and not that card.... It seems like raza the chained wouldnt be a problem with any other class but with dk priest it made a powerfull deck.... Yep the problem are these cards not priest.... 
---
Bruce Banner is a scientist too....

Flamewaker and Kingsbane. Tempo Mage is one of my favorite decks ever and Flamewaker always felt like the linchpin of how I liked to play the archetype. Kingsbane since I was an Oil Rogue player back in GVG, and the more aggro/tempo variants really brought me back to how I feel Rogue was meant to be played.

So, I've been eating mages alive with this Shaman Burn deck feat. Spirit Of The Frog.

What Hearthstone needs is a true Casual mode, where there is no reward and people just play for fun. There will be no bot and very little net deck, because there is no point.
---
Dead Man's Hand/Dragon Warrior seems actually pretty good, I've only won with it. Control, armor up, remove threats, copy a hand full of 0-cost Dragons... the nature of the brawl negates the major downsides of Bring it On!
---
So far people have just been trying to OTK me with direct damage decks and I always have 30+ armor and the board by the time they come online.
---
I switched from English to German to practice, and the German dub isn't so bad imo.

This is why I love my discardlock deck

I netdeck because I find proper deck creation tedious, far less fun than simply taking a finished deck and playing the game.  Not hyper-competitive, so it's not from the burning desire to win, and my collection(s) is quite large (f2p in two regions, not in US).

Grimestreet was by far my favorite expansion despite the midrange/jade shaman, jade druid and miracle rogue it was so much fun playing the og jade druid. Maybe it was my only real time where i played hearthstone a lot, but damn i loved playing jade druid.
---
What the hell is a meme deck anyway? I see this term but I don't understand it. Can you give some examples?
---
I think your logic is flawed, because if you type in "Hill" you get cards with the string "Hill" in it. "Hill" isn't a keyword, either.
---
I'm playing mill rogue with Brann and spirit of the shark and I must say it's pretty effective. My opponents usually have an empty deck and a full hand on turn 5. 
---
Is that a He-Man reference I see?!
---
Nah, Wild doesn't usually have the ridiculous rules of tavern brawls. It's been a long time since Flamewaker was part of the Wild meta, yet he always dominates random Tavern Brawls. 
---
The only thing really shitting on Wild format right now is Barnes, primarily in Big Priest. Other than that the format is pretty good. 
---
I keep Splintergraft in my "play cards costing 8" deck. I have enough big things often enough that I can often get a 10/10 with taunt, or divine shield, or lifesteal. He combos well with Gloop Sprayer.
---
Basically, the deck wins by having a ton of mana ramp / taunt, and then out-valuing the opponent by playing tons of big stuff.
---
Wild almost all legendary rogue?
---
I suggest you to wait new expansion to come. And better 3-4 weeks after it release because after it comes there will be no old decks, and meta will be builded from 0
---
Is that a mf darrkmane reference?
---
It fits more when you realise blizz is going to tease us with dalaraan forever
---
Stargazer Luna?

4.4k gold and 8.5k dust. I hope i can get like 6k gold before expansion and i will probably have 16k dust after the hall of fame dust value.

No, it was me, Dio, all along!

Just use that 0 mana destroy a demon on malchezaar. A patch a while ago made it work.

Another boring OTK brawl. Oh you drew your OTK before me, you win, and vice versa. Incredibly boring.
---
BiggieSmalls#11287 ASIA 80g trade only, you go first. Pls reply on reddit too so I know when you add me. 
---
You said it, 
---
Hex Lord and Kangor's - also I'm expecting that there will be some broken stuff with Bwonsamdi and Talanji.
---
The problem in those three classes is that it has been very challenging for the last 4 sets to come up with a legendary card that is better than the Death Knight.
---
Along those same lines, I'm interested curious see what Warlock looks like post-Gul'dan.
---
When I say check for freezing, I mean deduce if it might be freezing. If you attack with dagger and nothing triggers, then you have to consider whether or not you want to attack with lich King because the trap is either freezing or snake/venom trap. So you pretty much always want to attack with dagger first
---
Warrior will have a solid deck in rush warrior. Most of its bad matchups will be a thing of the past so i say if you are looking for a good day 1 deck with no new cards RUsh Warrior it is.
---
It‚Äôs nuts that, with both Malfurion Death Knight and Baku leaving standard, there will be no way for Gonk Druid to permanently increase their attack for the next year. 
---
I'm kinda new player, so I don't have Kel'Thuzad or any wild cards for that matter. Even crafted Grim Patrons to try Frothings + Grim strategy but to no avail. Eventually I went with lots of taunts + Vicious Fledgling and Mossy Horror. My draw had to be 1 drop and 2 drop to contest the board, turn 3 Fledgling and pray for WF and Magic Shell on turn 4. After lots of tries I made my Fledgling like 30/20 or something insane, while Mossy Horror took care of the Frostmourne phase, so the Fledgling could keep hitting face. I'm pretty sure Warrior took me longer than all other classes combined. With Hunter I just got a big Hyena which he couldn't adress.
---
Aviana, I loved old Tog and Alligner druid so much
---
LOL
---
Depends on what's in the new set, so...... conjecture is completely pointless at the moment.
---
You could get [[Withbang]] and try out many many types of decks. 
---
Welcome to hearthstone. Where the rules are made up and your skill doesn't matter.
---
I mean, if you've played wow, you knew it was dalaran from the very first tease image with the sewers. Any one speculation was just silly tbh
---
For sure the deck is going to look a lot different, but Mage has always had some form of control deck floating around and I'm willing to bet Malacrass will be part of the next control iteration that we see.
---
DK Rexxar because I love to watch the world burn.
---
I like your karma, I think I will TAKE IT!
---
Yeah. but now you're comparing something that we know objectively (cars don't run on ketchup) to something subjective (person doesn't like low-brow or gag humor). Draw all the conclusions you want, but I'd be wary about applying common patterns on individuals and at the same time 'no one in particular'. 
---
Any other answer besides Whizbang is wrong.
---
no need to get snippy. there have been other Brawls with "always-on auras" modeled after this or that card, where if you also played the card, the effect was not doubled

Have you had issues with the game freezing up? It'll seem like the other player is taking a very long time, and once I realize that they should have roped by now, I have to close the app, reopen it, reconnect, and I've missed my next turn.

I love all the hype for these expansions just to watch it all get crushed when they start announcing the cards that are broken or overpowered.

---
Afaik he got bored and noped out of Hearthstone for other games.
---
&gt; I don't get why they just not simply ban it from tournament.
---
Because that would require them adding a tournament mode. Otherwise someone could RNG themselves a Yogg in a competitive match even if it didnt start in a deck.
---
no u
---
Hell yes. Back in the days before KFC, I was playing Shadowform Reno Priest. Jade druid was the bane of my existence though.
---
Why does Dr. Boom look so sad? I thought the point of boomsday was that he was inviting us in for a tour, stuff happens, and we have to help clean up after his scientists/self. Did he just blow through all his funding or did all his scientists leave as they finished their experiments? 
---
25k, 20dust and 80‚Ç¨
---
Its a rotation set though and they just removed all the big powerful cards along with it.
---
They will probably keep the power-level lower than usual
---
SUMMON AN EVEN LARGER MAN!
---
Decent to farm gold, though
---
I tried that one, but it appears to only be usable as creating a big heal for yourself. But staying alive isn't really the problem for Druid, so the lifesteal is not needed. But, indeed, should have listed it among my experiments
---
I got a golden one as well, gives you golden copies though &lt;3
---
I hate how much both cards are one card win conditions.
---
I have no idea what this means as I only played WoW to Level 20.  But people seem excited so I'll take that as a good thing.
---
Exactly, which would have been fine. The problem is creating a mid-game snowball. If it was a late game card there would actually be viable counterplay.
---
Well play more then

---
Dalaran has been a major city for 2 expansions in WoW it has a lot of lore behind it plus some cool places within it like the underbelly and the violet hold
---
What he's saying is that these aren't "leaks".  Blizzard is releasing the "leaks" themselves.
---
Did you cry the second time ?
---
Are you forgetting the several incorrect speculations in the past?
---
That's one thing that I feel like older combo decks had more. Freeze mage used to have the option of saving their burn to combo or using it to clear minions. Newer decks like Mechathun and Infinite mage are frustratingly binary in that way.
---
And ‚Äúonly takes 1 damage at a time‚Äù
---
Looks like Hades from Smite!
---
Undatakah, all it takes is one good Paladin deathrattle minion to be printed. ‚ÄúRestore all friendly characters to full health‚Äù, ‚ÄúSet all enemy minions attack to 1‚Äù something insane like that combined with prelate will really make for some really ridiculous shenanigans. 
---
I also want the whole heal pally archetype to the rise, I have all the cards for it, it just needs some serious support in terms of minions and possibly a start of game effect where over healing gives you armor
---
Oh and rush warrior is going to be T1 come rotation, it‚Äôs not losing any cards so yeah have fun with that
---
Flip side: there are few things more frustrating than surviving a hunter's early aggression, he has 1 card left in hand on turn 7, and plops out DSR. All of a sudden the clock is on again and you're on the backfoot.
---
Well the pirate decks only existed because of patches so no matter how you cut it it was printed BECAUSE of Patches
---
Yeah yeah just show us some cards you dumb bastards
---
On one hand I like that it's a wild brawl, because I can do a lot of fun crazy things. On the other hand it's a wild brawl and it's getting a lot of flack because of everyone who disenchants their entire wild collection or are too new to have a decent amount of wild cards. I kinda wish they could do it like the play mode where you could have standard tavern brawl and wild tavern brawl. Heck it could extend the fun for the wild players as they have two formats to experiment with. 
---
Is there any other game that drags on with its reveals like this? It is excruciating. 
---
Haha you must be new to expect some creativity from team 5
---
Flawed logic. You could just as easily argue that people with larger collections are more likely to netdeck because they are in a better position to change decks whenever the meta changes, whereas f2p players are more likely to experiment because they don't always have all the cards for the current T1 deck, especially after a balance pack.
---
I don't think that would be true either, but it shows that there are dangers in drawing conclusions based on "I have characteristic A and B, therefore everyone with charactertistic A also have characteristic B".
---
In practice, the size of your collection may or may not correlate to your likelihood of being a deckbuilder. All that you can say for certain is that someone with a large collection will have a wider range of decks available to them, but that could just as easily mean "Every T1/T2 deck" as "A dozen meme/handcrafted decks".
---
Boom in his suit would still get wrecked by most of the warriors, paladins, wildshaped druids, and rogue assassins in Hearthstone. I mean, he can't even *control* the suit every turn.
---
especially with cards like Splintergraft that do have potential.   
---
Cards like Hi'Reek, Harbinger Celestia or Duskfallen Aviana are safe dust picks because they are unfixably bad cards.   
---
Check out Tommy J and ZeroMana on youtube, they both have a video on budget decks for beating Lich King.
---
Dalaran is a pretty big deal in WoW.  First city made of the alliance between humans and high elves (the pale skinned ones).  A heaven for mages to study arcane arts, or research pressing issues like demons, necromancy, orcs, etc.
---
Knife juggler only procs 4 or 5 times with a defile combo, it‚Äôs super strange! Other minions behave differently; you can get six+ discards off lakari fellhound, and grim patron can spawn 14, but an immune knife juggler only throws out 4/5 knives.
---
This OTK Paladin deck I've been using is alright. It's fairly cheap and runs almost no wild cards, and the few wild cards are not essential to the deck. \[\[Coldlight Oracles\]\] and \[\[Thalnos\]\] can be replaced with other cards that draw like Gnomish Inventor, Hammer of Wrath, or Acolyte. \[\[Sunkeeper Tarim\]\] is only if you need to flip the board and could be replaced by \[\[Shrink Ray\]\]. You could also possibly drop the second \[\[Time Out!\]\] for a second \[\[Wolfrider\]\] for more consistency. Hope this helps for any newer plays that don't have a sizable collection and/or wild cards.

3/3/1 | Charge  
---
Destroyed minions don‚Äôt exit the battlefield until the action that destroyed them completes.  This is the normal case.  (There may be exceptions that I‚Äôm not thinking of offhand.)
---
This, for example, is how Finja used to be able to suicide into an opposing minion, but then survive because the +2/+1 buff from pre-nerf Murloc Warleaders she summoned brought her health back above 0 with their aura.
---
No they aren't
---
Fuck you and your ice block!
---
100% craft Genn and Baku. You get the dust back in a month and get to keep the cards.

This OTK Paladin deck I've been using is alright. It's fairly cheap and runs almost no wild cards, and the few wild cards are not essential to the deck. \[\[Coldlight Oracle\]\] and \[\[Bloodmage Thalnos\]\] can be replaced with other cards that draw like \[\[Gnomish Inventor\]\], \[\[Hammer of Wrath\]\], or \[\[Acolyte of Pain\]\]. \[\[Sunkeeper Tarim\]\] is only if you need to flip the board and could be replaced by \[\[Shrink Ray\]\]. You could also possibly drop the second \[\[Time Out!\]\] for a second \[\[Wolfrider\]\] for more consistency. Hope this helps for any newer plays that don't have a sizable collection and/or wild cards.

3/1/3 | Whenever this minion takes damage, draw a card.

&gt; Encourages interesting deck building decisions
---
It literally does not at all. It encourages searching "jade" in the card box and adding everything and then just filling the rest of the deck with stall.
---
It was a deck in a can. The only interesting use for it was as a 1 of in mill druid.
---
Wicked Skeleton. Underrated.
---
I hope so but Im not so sure. For a while, control mage was just not a real deck.
---
if you *NEED* the dust for some card u want to craft and play AND the legendary seems in the current situation to be bad, then do it.
---
If the legendary for that class is good, don't do it.
---
None. I use real money 
---
If it is indeed the expansion and not just the adventure's theme, then new possible Legendaries include:
---
- Cyanigosa
---
- Zuramat
---
- Khadgar
---
- Aethas
---
- Algalon
---
- Ansirem
---
- Modera
---
- Kael'Thas
---
- Kel'Thuzad
---
- Korialstrasz
---
- Teron Gorefiend
---
- Vargoth
---
- Vereesa Windrunner

I like your soul, I think I will TAKE IT!

3 years , 151 ranked hunter wins. Impressive. 
---
That makes sense, seeing as I live out in the countryside in my country the internet speeds are not half as good as someone from a city's. I will try it anyways though, thank you!
---
Says him?
---
Let's play guess the Verb.
---
Yeah that's happened multiple times before too
---
I like the idea of a card which gives you retroactive value on your battlecries, like you said, resulting in effects like a board clear, adding something to your hand, copying a minion on the board...just crazy value. I like that.
---
What I don't like is that at some arbitrary point in the late game, you could play a single 9 mana card, and just because you have played the other cards in your deck throughout the game, no differently than any other deck would, you just win the game outright.
---
And if you don't win, it's because the matchup was by default in your opponent's favor, or your draws were bad, or their draws were good, or some combination of those things. It was never a matchup where it felt like my decisions determined whether or not I won the game. There is just nothing interesting or engaging about that type of gameplay to me, that I can make all the best plays possible every turn for the whole game, and then with any amount of health left, I can just lose because you drew and played one card. Even Frost Lich Jaina which gives an insane amount of value for one card doesn't literally just win you the game because you played it with almost no cards left in your deck. That's a stupid thing for one card to do.
---
Like, imagine if in Exodia Mage you could just play your Sorcerer's Apprentices for early game tempo, and Antonidas' effect was "Battlecry: If you have played 2 Sorcerer's Apprentices, 2 Molten Reflections, and 6 other spells at any point this game, win the game."  That's basically Shudderwock.
---
**How long can this go on?!**
---
Boom isn't original to Hearthstone, he's from WoW. He's a quest boss in Netherstorm.
---
This hugely depends on how much you play.
---
I assume you want to dust cards to make good decks to climb ladder. But the reward for ladder is almost nothing. Dusting (non-extra) cards make you fall so far behind on expanding your collection. You will consistently end up playing only 2-3 decks at each given time, and if those decks are good, they will inevitably get nerfed, which makes you playability for the game almost zero. The dust economy is all about the rich getting richer (just like any economy), and dusting cards is the sure way to make yourself poor.
---
Since around KFT, I have gained at the very least 20k dust from nerfed cards (with the next HoF rotation). I don't even need to dust my other cards anymore and still survive comfortably. Of course, if you dust the majority of your cards, you will benefit little from those nerfs.
---
Oh sure, but part of the complexity of the deck was using warsong to board clear which role compressed the deck hard. That's gone and its a different deck. 
---
That's a bold statement.
---
I want one that says not roping, kid trying to kill themselves 
---
Heh, thankie kindly
---
Why the fuck would the single player be not be related to the expansion 
---
It's a tough one, I must admit.
---
You open 1 quest guarantees when you opened those packs? 
---
I reject your reality and substitute a narrative I find more compelling
---
In the long term, very bad.  But some people want the short term dust.  At the very least, you don't want to dust it until you are done opening packs in the set.  The worst thing you want is to dust it and then open it again later.  (having a copy prevents you from getting it in the future).
---
My thoughts also, I really don‚Äôt believe that every single teaser got spoiled accidentally
---
Ha, ha,
---
#HAAA!
---
he wins the game off this play, the hunter has no cards and he gets 2 cards with lifesteal + taunt. 
---
Is this even your final form?
---
Bold of you to assume Team 5 is gonna use some actual existing lore characters.
---
I've been playing since release and I only started playing Ranked in the past two years. Some people played casual to start, I played Arena for the first two years exclusively.
