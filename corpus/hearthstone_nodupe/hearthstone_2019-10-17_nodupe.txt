How could the person you responded to have possibly meant anything else?
---
You're so good! Can you do Garrosh next? ;P
---
The balance is a huge reason, otherwise the dropoff in players--people who had already bought into the game--wouldn't have been so dramatic. The basic concept of the gameplay was a lot of fun, with a lot of decision points and interactivity, but were let down by the actual design of most of the cards.
---

---
To prevent games from going on too long, their solution was to make high mana/gold cost insane game ending bombs (Time of Triumph, Incarnation of Selemene, Horn of the Alpha) that made pretty much everything that happened before totally irrelevant. So constructed, the most popular format in any CCG, just became a small handful of decks that were just racing to these game ending bombs either through spamming board wipes or fast ramp.
---
To make things worse, the premiere cards of the game, the Heroes, were also grossly imbalanced, with a small handful having just better stats or signature cards (or both), meaning if you were in their color you played these 2-3 out of the 11 or so in each color or you were wrong (see: Axe, Drow)
---
And then to really drive the knife in, there were a ton of weird, bad cards that did almost nothing like Watchtower or Rolling Thunder, and this made up about a third of the card pool. Compared to the basic set of Hearthstone or any other modern CCG, the base set of Artifact is terrible. It feels like some sort of terrible Magic set from the mid-2000s or late 90s, like Kamigawa or Mercadian Masques.
---
The cost surely did a lot of work in scaring away people who would otherwise at least give it a shot, but just making the game f2play would not save it. I say this as someone who currently has 29 event tickets in Artifact and never spent a dime on it (not even the buy-in, a friend gifted me their TI code). But I still haven't played in over six months, even though I loved the baseline mechanics. And I'm not alone, the game lost over 75% of its playerbase in under two months.
---
At this rate there's almost nothing Blizzard can do that wouldn't be financial suicide for them. They dug their own grave, now they have to suffer.

In other words, sometimes instead of finding an arena opponent, I just get an automatic loss.

I guess that is where we disagree.

I think Blizzard's stance and actions were apolitical as you can get, and I don't think they are supporting China and their government by adhering to their rules, regulations and laws.

I got beta access and the games are a lot shorter than HS. Maybe due to the health pool being 20 and not 30. It is maybe 5 minutes less per game than HS, but there are the ocassional long games.

I'll tell you what, if you become the CEO of a mutli-billion dollar company, then you can take all the risks you want.

Yes. Exactly. Which is why  I wildly support the idea of giving the player the option to choose no buckets, instead of replacing a bucket with an empty one. It's just such a shittier way to do it the way it is.

Never dust a playable deck.
---
If you're F2P, new, and need dust, pick 1-3 classes to focus on and dust every blue/gold card from other classes. You can also dust non-gold epics and legendaries if you want to, but I wouldn't personally unless I was (a) sure that they are terrible, and (b) I wasn't going to open any more packs of that expansion.
---
... or just play Arena.
---
Why? 40/40 charge for 1 Mana is at least tier 2
---
&gt;However, what's disheartening is Blizzard's COMPLETE hypocrisy in similar situations
---
Did I miss someone in a gas mask calling for a revolution before this?
---
It’s not considering some of the top posts are about it despite mods deleting posts. Downplaying the whole thing is ridiculous since it added to and helped spark the national conversation in the topic when even Senators were weighing in.

And on Tuesday the House passed a bill supported by Dems and Republicans to support the HK protestors. You’d be lying if this along with the NBA thing wasn’t a factor in that bill and the fact that both sides supported it.

Anyway, it sounds like Arena is more suited to you than constructed based on your other replies. I wanted to add another note of caution: there are a number of cards that have been temporarily added to all player accounts for a 2-month period. Make sure that you don't invest heavily in a deck that relies on those cards only to have them disappear on you. (Mainly thinking of Evolve Shaman as a strong deck that will self-destruct after the event is over.)

[Link to the Hearthstone Update post that describes the current event.](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23174811/)

I would reccomend tmobile titles. Lophis: Roguelike, and Pirates: Outlaws. Both have very deep deck building. Lophis has a pretty huge difficulty spike which is annoying and Pirates, while slower to start, opens up into a pretty impressive range of deck builds/playstyles. If you liked the dungeon runs you will like these.

You can negotiate by saying "well fuck you, I'm going to another game." If they care about you, then they'll beg you to stay. Maybe you can say "hey, I got another offer from Valve. Would you like to loosen up the terms then I wouldn't go there?" If they don't, maybe you don't worth that much as a player, or they are the "Google" of all companies and they attract you more than you attract them.
---
If you are the Lionel Messi of e-Sports, with a cult following of 40M dedicate fans WW, then perhaps Blizzard will bend backwards three times and lick your shoes. But you aren't, so if you really want to negotiate with Blizzard, then be better.

I'll tell you that I'm with you in full sentiments. There are so many considerations I want to tackle about but the main thing is how they try to bloat the crypto feature into the card game. The masses are easily startled by this without thinking critically the implications of such a feature (amounting to nothing valuable).
---
I think the speed at which they punished blitz compared to AU is more telling about the damage control - if they were equally fervent that their platform not be used for politics and were convinced that they were right (and that politics had nothing to do with their decision), the ban would have gone out way earlier. 
---
The timing of the ban now after people repeatedly pointed out the hypocrisy is what makes it reek of damage control
---
I got it as well. Do we supposed to get it (because of the event), or is this some kind of apology from the dev?
---
Yeah, you have no right to speak since you're playing a cancerous deck
---
At least claim it was in solidarity with Hong Kong and not because the app is a piece of shit.
---
Yeah Google is hard eh
---
Netrunner? You still built decks and collect cards for that, right? I remember building some really strong Corp decks , both on Basic and with the Proteus expansion.
---
Yeah I have lost games from this it’s completely unplayable I cannot make it through a single game without forfeiting an entire turn or two because of disconnects and crashes.  I have completely stopped trying to play on my smoke break at work.
---
not sure how I feel about the game yet, but their economy system is absolutely fantastic: skipping packs altogether and having a direct correlation between dollar to cards is amazing (you buy ingame currency which buys wildcards for each rarity meaning there's an exact dollar amount for each rarity of card)
---
They were right to ban conversations, like blizz has done (blizz was too fast and too severe though). Tournaments are no place to discuss politics, otherwise tournaments stop being about games, and turn into debates. They have to let players know to stay on topic. This scandal aint about the punishment blitz got, but the circunstances around it, like the "tweet" about national pride.
---
Netrunner has a living card game model where you buy full sets/expansions rather than random packs so there's not really a collection aspect to it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_comprehension
---
**Reading comprehension**
---
Reading comprehension is the ability to process text, understand its meaning, and to integrate with what the reader already knows. Fundamental skills required in efficient reading comprehension are knowing meaning of words, ability to understand meaning of a word from discourse context, ability to follow organization of passage and to identify antecedents and references in it, ability to draw inferences from a passage about its contents, ability to identify the main thought of a passage, ability to answer questions answered in a passage, ability to recognize the literary devices or propositional structures used in a passage and determine its tone, to understand the situational mood (agents, objects, temporal and spatial reference points, casual and intentional inflections, etc.) conveyed for assertions, questioning, commanding, refraining etc. and finally ability to determine writer's purpose, intent and point of view, and draw inferences about the writer (discourse-semantics).Ability to comprehend text is influenced by reader's skills and their ability to process information. If word recognition is difficult, students use too much of their processing capacity to read individual words, which interferes with their ability to comprehend what is read.

Few quick examples of big physical TCGs:  yugioh doesn't use a mana system at all and has other resources, and Pokemon is fully focused on battling enemy Pokemon and has a "mana" system where it's way easier to lose.

I haven't seen any other company shut down someones right to speech in order to appease their Chinese consumer base. Blizzard decided to take sides, not us, it sucks that you have to be on a side now but you do.

Not true though. I do have a friend that started hearthstone recently and made it to rank 5 within his 2nd month. It sometimes depends on what you play, and what kind of advice you pick up on. Eg. play hunter - it has a lot of budget options.

He has some in his deck, and crystologies.

yes

That theory about air particles is popular bur it is still not canon. Mages use arcane magic to have control over elements.

You realize you can follow the rules and still catr about human lives, right?

I meant getting a game you know you'll probably be disappointed by. As you say getting games is a bit of a luxury I'm confused why you'd willingly by something that will disappoint you. My advice would personally be to get Luigi's mansion, and get Pokemon Sword and Shield second hand after a few weeks.

Where they *explicitly* state the opposite of what you claim.
---
I've just been playing the deck for the past 3 hours, from what I've seen, the game is usually decided in the first 4-5 turns and amet is to make sure you can last the next 4-5 turns. So basically the deck works if I have a heavy minion within the first 3-4 turns, which I usually do

&gt;tells people to look up a definition for communism
---
&gt;claims a large amount of business and industry being state run=communism
---
From the first page of google:
---
"In political and social sciences, communism (from Latin communis, "common, universal")[1][2] is the philosophical, social, political, and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money,[3][4] and the state"
---
"Economic and social system in which all (or nearly all) property and resources are collectively owned by a classless society and not by individual citizens. Based on the 1848 publication 'Communist Manifesto' by two German political philosophers, Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his close associate Friedrich Engels (1820-1895), it envisaged common ownership of all land and capital and withering away of the coercive power of the state
---
Read more: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/communism.html"
---
"an economic system based on public ownership of property and control of the methods of production, and in which no person profits from the work of others"
---
"Communism derives from the French commun (common). Ideally, according to communism, society shares all property in common, everyone shares the burden of labor, and everyone shares the profits of that labor."
---
"a theory or system of social organization based on the holding of all property in common, actual ownership being ascribed to the community as a whole or to the state."
---
"a political theory derived from Karl Marx, advocating class war and leading to a society in which all property is publicly owned"
---
"a system in which goods are owned in common and are available to all as needed
---
b: a theory advocating elimination of private property"
---
"Communism, political and economic doctrine that aims to replace private property and a profit-based economy with public ownership and communal control of at least the major means of production"
---
"Communism is the political belief that all people are equal, that there should be no private ownership and that workers should control the means of producing things."
---
If it makes you feel any better communism is still a shit ideology and state ownership was mentioned as an alternate definition like twice.
---
I've always wondered wether Hearthstone was worth getting into this late in the game
---
I did it in 28 and got nothing.
---
Fixed, I was going off the clauses stipulated in the contract. I should have double checked their message.
---
I suspect because I try to point out, why I believe Blizzard’s revised is fair.
---
So they should book the 120+ original voice actors (maybe fewer since there might be overlaps), get them in the studio to record 6 lines each? That doesn't seem ideal either. Voice actors of the quality Blizzard requires are often pretty expensive (per session).
---
It's a prickly spot for them, all things considered I can see why they didn't make new voicelines for the portraits. Like I said, I was a little disappointed with some of the art quality and themes though (but they're growing on me a bit).
---
idk how many league players (i’m one myself) know this but riot has often bowed to china for example they changed one of their characters visual design to be released in china (karthus fid kinda need a visual rework anyway but i digress) and the casters for worlds can only call hong kong attitude HKA or HK attitude iirc but the workers have made what appears to be an excellent game just don’t watch the live streams since that’s a different part of riot telling people to not do XYZ not their team working on legends of runeterra
---

The problem nowadays is that virtually no average consumer is ideally informed, which makes a capitalist system a little dark and disquieting. Therefore, we should all vote for Bernie.
---
And there it is. Anub Arak in action.
---
Riot hasn't done anything on the scale of Blizzard in terms of protecting Chinese interests. When you lump them together simply because "China," you're doing Blizzard a big favor. Blizzard did something bad to stand out, and when you don't let them stand out like they deserve, you're only helping them.
---
Boycott Blizzard... also the card
---
Blizzard are the ones who brought politics into the game.
---
They didn't have to, that was their choice.
---
I’ll respond to you with a quote I found earlier:
---
“People who say “keep politics out of my (insert thing here)” are ignoring that politics pervasively shapes every aspect of our lives, and for those without the privilege of living in a fairly democratic society it’s the equivalent of hearing the rest of the world saying “I don’t want your suffering to ruin my good time.”
---
What your doing is equivalent to conservatives telling Colin Kaepernick to shut up and sit down for using his platform to denounce police brutality. I’m sorry buddy, but pro-gamers don’t exist for your entertainment, they’re real people with real opinions and real struggles.
---
KK is a pretty rare case where he'd be good, and pyroblast is 1 maan more for 2 extra damage that isn't stopped by taunt.  Ysera is a value generator.
---
It does make sense why they'd not really include him.  They don't have Leeroy either because spells are often more efficient.  And they programmed zeph for more interesting cards, an 8/8 with charge is... well, honestly a kind of boring card in a sense?  It's the aesthetic of king krush that make him AWESOME, but "X/Y with charge" sounds like a common card, right?
---
Can you link some examples please, of casters or players expressing lgbtq support on official blizzard streams.
---
That might indeed be true, but is understandable imo. When you're having a huge fanbase in China and need to take little adjustments to fit their cultural specialties and it doesn't affect the west too much, that is what you just do. I think in the earlier years China even had some different icons splashes and icons than the western clients.
---
As a player who played almost all the time from beta and is not playing right now for cca 10 months, IMHO adding these old cards show that Blizzard is clueless. Playercount online was probably tanking hard and Blizzard had to do something till the next expansion(i dont agree with this becouse pushing these cards from Standard to wild was that they take space from a new cards it devaluates many cards from recent expansions for 2 months). But it shows that so far the RoS(and whole standard after RoS) didnt make enough fun/competetive archetypes and Blizz needed to push more cards into the system. I hope that Blizz will learn from this and make bigger expansions so not 135-140 card per but like 195-200 so something like +25% while maintaining quality.
---

This is why we don’t use the concede button against bots.

---
I was playing as Dr. Boom, so I had already shuffled about 12 bombs and 4 mines (from Iron Juggernaut) into his deck. I was at 32 hp, while he was at about 35 and 5 cards in hand. It is his turn, he has 27 damage on board, and the absolut madlad decides the perfect way to start the turn is with an ultimate infestation to my face... I think you can guess how it ended for him
---
I doubt it, Blizzard isn't savvy with community relations to pull a move like that.  Also you'd have to keep ALL the mods quiet or there would be a game-ending shitstorm.  Big risk.
---
I thought this thread was about runeterra vs hearthstone but all i can see is the debate upon china...
---
honest hearthstone sucks, if your curve minion is beaten by theirs or if you miss a drop you are finished and you are just going through the motions.
---
I also think people are showing outrage in terribly shitty ways. The amount of posts of people going into stores to hide cards or packs is just stupid. It’s not hurting blizzard all it was doing was hurting some poor kid who had to tidy up after them
---
It's not suppression to remove something that doesn't belong here. There's subs specifically for all of that. This is a damn card game sub.
---
Mods didn't listen to community when they changed the rules to ban any posts about player penalties... I wouldn't be surprised... They are a law unto themselves.
---
It's definitely gonna be meta-defining, just like this one. Building a deck with certain restriction is (imo) a very cool concept. Hopefully they come at next year's event.
---
While i agree that the thought process was short, i believe it to be justified, some of the reintroduced cards  have already existed in a standard format and have been moved. If this is to help with development i am all for it. If its to help players get back into the game, i am for that as well. Most of all, if these cards have a shot of getting back into the meta as a result of seeing who and how often they are played, I will support it til the end!
---
China needs to ok it first.
---
A question though: how did you allow him to summon Ra?
---
Lol
---
The tavern brawl is alot less fun with a doggo at 20/20(that's what my doggo is at)you finish the game in less then 13 mins no chellange
---
If you wanna stick with Hearthstone, the more recent singleplayer content (i.e. Dungeon Run, Rumble Run, Tombs of Terror, etc) is basically that.
---
Not glitches. I don't know what the first card is you're referring to, but the second is duplatransmogrifier, and does what it should.
---
As a result to the change i hope they stay! Permanently!
---
that aint how the world works mate. If they are protesting, its their choice, but there are consequences for every action. If i was in a meeting with my boss, and suddently i started shouting anti trump comments, i was in my right to protest, because has an adult, i can.
---
but my boss can also fire me for doing that in a meeting and not in my own time. Protesting isn't a magical shield that will protect you from consequences. 
---
This is why people look up to protesters, because they are aware of consequences and still do it.
---
contact support and specify your phone model / OS etc, if you write something here you do not solve anything
---
High effott post where ?
---
I can assure you, I'm not happy to have non-games against Evolve or endless N'zoth lockdowns. To each their own, but speak for yourself.
---
It proves exactly nothing. The rule just caused a PR nightmare. So they just take a few days to think about it instead of pulling the trigger immediately. The only reason for this rule is PR after all.
---
And lets be honest here, you would also take it as prove for your theories, if they banned them without hesitation.
---
They would need someone to condemn Hong Kong on stream, so they can ban him. An even then people would find a way to spin this against them.
---
Why would you kill 1?
---
&gt; Also, despite my stance on Blizzard having the right to say we don’t want politics in our games. 
---
Sure, but this makes it sound like Blitzchung is the guy who made things political. That without him doing this, there would be no politics in HS or coming from Blizzard.
---
This isn't true. The CCP have made all speech coming from businesses they partner with political.
---
It start with the smaller things. No more bones/ghosts in card art. Then it's larger things, not releasing pro LGBT campaigns in China.
---
Now it's the heavy handed punishments handed out to the casters and Blitzchung.
---
Blizzard/HS/the media you consume was political long before this incident. This just brought it to your attention.
---
[The films you watch, the games you play, all these things are being pressured by China to show a worldview they agree with.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/dffmkv/having_issues_finding_my_steam_launcher_on_my/f32rhzv/) If you try to speak out against them, your risk your job, your livelihood and in some places your life.   
---
So in this environment, the only avenue left to speak out against China is with protests. Protests which we then look at and go 'Aww man, don't make this political....'
---
So the best part about this for China? In many cases they don't actually need to do anything. We'll censor ourselves for them.
---
Look at how much discussion on this board is about how people just want this to go away so they can enjoy their entertainment in peace. We're willing to shut out the last remaining avenue for those oppressed by China to have a voice. Then we sit around and talk about how neutral and sensible we're being.
---
I thought that this event would've been the perfect time to give people free wild cards. Let people see how fun they are in standard, so when they rotate they can build a deck around them, not having to use as much dust and increasing the wild playerbase. Would be fine for costs too, in fact it'd incentivise players to spend dust in wild, meaning they need more for standard too, AND blizz would be shown to give cards out to help.
---
I do not want to upset you but have you ever tried a hand lock deck where you just rip battle cry minions from the deck? Its either way none the less.

Once Solo Adventure he self-suicided since I was toying with him for so long... I tot he just gave up
---
Hah, ok you guys can continue bitching; I'm no longer on break and every comeback is the same and you guys are obviously too young in years or life experience to know how businesses work or how things move forward once something shitty has happened. 
---
I'm not avoiding a hard topic, I'm challenging your "addressing a hard topic" by boycotting a free to play game and then martying yourself across threads saying how dirty you feel playing, oh I've deleted it like 5 times now - oh? I deleted it 10 times and took a shower afterwards I feel so dirty lol... Get a grip. That does ZERO for anything except your own ego. Realize that.
---
If you want to get involved and help the party you believe in, quitting a free to play game doesn't really cut it, but have fun feeling the false sense of accomplishment!
---
Woah dude. Let me explain why I posted this. I just wanted to share a piece of gameplay that seemed unique and I thought may intrigue the hearthstone community. As for why I have chosen to keep playing Hearthstone, it’s simply because I personally don’t follow politics (though I know I should). I like to think that still being relatively young (U18) is an excuse for not following politics which I know may seem ignorant and selfish, but thats just how I’ve decided to live life right now. My point is, I don’t really have a strong opinion on politics so I’ve continued to play hearthstone. I apologise to those of you who are boycotting and want others to do so as well, but at the end of the day this was just my decision.
---
You think you're the first one to post this? It's been posted 100 times in the past week. 
---
So, you're just as bad as the people you are complaining about.
---
Still flat
---
If you pick the dog more than once, it will combine with the other dogs in your deck when you summon it. So 2 will make it a 2/2, and so on. It is also persistent across runs, so you will start your next run with 2 dogs in your deck. It gets stupid powerful when you have like 10, because half your deck is dogs so you’re almost guaranteed to draw it.
---
That's not for you to decide. OP has the freedom to make their own choices.
---
  
---
The reason the Hong Kong issue is so shit is because people's rights and freedom are being threatened. To boycott Blizzard for supporting these issues whilst also telling other people they are not free to play a game they enjoy is incredibly hypocritical.
---
I'm not saying you are a bad person, because I get you want Hong Kong to get the respect and treatment they deserve, however trying to force others to see the same way is very similar to what Blizzard is doing in suppressing opinions and what people are allowed to enjoy.
---
(In no way am I comparing what you are doing with all China is doing, nothing can compare to the harvesting of citizens organs and imprisoning innocent people for having the "wrong" religion. I'm merely showing that forcing people to do one thing that YOU believe is right, isn't the correct way to do things.)
---
Some people rather not look into politics and just play what they enjoy. You cant expect everyone to just quit something because of controversy, yeah it’d be nice for some people but it’s just not feasible. So don’t be rude to someone who is just trying to play a game and have fun. Games are made to be enjoyed. If every time there was a controversy and everyone left the game there would be almost no games being played. Plus if already bought the adventure before he might as well get his moneys worth
---
Lost his head to the other horsemen
---
You're interestingly raising a point I frequently touched upon in the previous week: if people are truly opposed to China, boycotting Blizzard isn't nearly enough. Switching over to Riot would just be insanely hypocritical IF those people are claiming to be pro-HK.
---
It's fascinating just how close our statements are, I made the same remark about electronics as well
---
I like how it says Congratulations!  Way to rub it in!  Ouch
---
Bug, theres no reward
---
Hey, good morning, buddy!
---
Did you sleep, well?
---
But in the end of the day, China will still be there to torment it's own citizens. To think that your actions can have any effect on it is absurd.
---
Looks horrible from a player and looks horrible on streams because you can't see cards in hand.

I did it in 8 minutes and got two golden cards.

The Headless Horseman vs the 4 Horsemen. Who will win?
---
So apparently using the 4 Horsemen skips phase 2, killing the headless horseman with his head intact.
---
There’s a lot of Sino prejudice mixed in with legit criticism
---
Thats why you dont play him on turn 5. You wait until you have 4 mana left against a statue to get hex every time
---
Due to the pressure from the CBA, which interestingly enough ran by Yao Ming, former player of the Houston Rockets
---
Its horrible horrible boring but easiest ever to farm 6+ wins(from a 3-4 win average player)
---
Yah dude blizzard is falling apart and the mods here are brainwashed lmaooooo
---
but you cannot draw it, because you get killed.
---
I still think they overreacted. The punishment is like 2 years hard labour for littering. Sure it's more appropriate than 10 years but it's still out of line.
---
But at this point to me the most important thing isn't blitz anymore, it's how goddamn weird Blizzards apology was. The conspiracy theorist in me thinks that there's a very good reason that that letter somehow passed blizzards PR department.
---
The things with conspiracy theorists is they always overestimate people/companies/governments sophistication. 
---
I am afraid this is an example of it.
---
Make blizzard crash and burn? oh ooh ouch rip 1% of my american market hello millions of chinese players and constant investment from tencent, trust me dude they are only going up
---
I beat it the first time in 30 minutes and 38 seconds and was really relieved to read this.
---
Sadly. you're not wrong
---
You're uncharitably reading a lot of Blizzard's actions. All I see is an extremely strong desire on part of Blizzard to not take sides in this toxic issue, and for good reason. 
---
They punished harshly at first out of a desire to demonstrate they are neutral in regards to Hong Kong. I think a strong argument could be made that the initial punishment was disproportionate to the violation, though even this case isn't so obvious to me given the kind of consequences the company faced faced. 
---
In principle, there is nothing objectionable about a gaming company wishing to remain agnostic in regards to a political issue. If you want to insist that this is due to profitability, then fine. But so is *every* issue. Not wanting to offend a significant portion of your customer base is pretty fundamental to every company.
---
Have they taken political positions in the past? Yes. But that doesn't mean they're obligated to make a stand on every hot button issue. You can want to tackle climate change without joining the gun debate. 
---
Your suggestions on what Blizzard should do to stop the mob is completely unreasonable. If Blizzard releases a positive statement in regards to the protests, that's taking a side. They're not going to do that. They're also not going to frame the protests as a democracy/free speech issue because that's also a pro-protest framing of the situation.
---
No reasonable person can suggest that Blitzchung didn't violate rules. No reasonable person can suggest that the violation didn't deeply offend a huge number of viewers. There's no objective and neutral justification for Blizzard to rescind their current mild punishment.
---
If you want to convince them otherwise, you have to construct an argument that doesn't rest on the premise that the pro-protest position is inherently good, because this is not a position that Blizzard is obligated or interested in taking.
---
I’m no expert either and I don’t care that much I just felt like being that guy. However, even the definition you wrote backs up how I thought it was. 
---
There is no failure in the code. It’s not like they wrote a program and it’s coming out with unexpected results. Somebody just input a 3 instead of a 4. See what I mean? A bug requires troubleshooting, going through the whole program to see where the code is contradicting itself. This is just a simple input error.
---
Hsreplay agrees at least, warrior and rogue/mage is insanely strong
---
Ok so I’m confused. How does the BFF work? All I’ve got is a loser 2/2
---
Despite ownership, they are not hiding that fact and are handling any discutable issues much better than Blizzard, which is only part owned by a Chinese company. Reality of the day, half the shit, if not more, we wear/use is (partly) made in China, unless you go out of your way to avoid that. Let the actions speak for the company and not worry where the money ends up. Because if that is really such a problem, we are either huge hypocrits or have to immediatly stop using and buying a lot of ‘loved’ products that many of us use every day.
---
The only serious RNG is teemo mushrooms on draws, but that's more playing with probabilities than pure RNG considering the typical ratio of mushrooms to remaining deck size is usually pretty high.
---
Surprised the mods are even allowing people to promote other card games on a hearthstone sub
---
The game freezes occasionally for me. At this point, it's unplayable.
---
Mobile has been pretty dreadful for me the last few days, even though I have an s10 plus I get crashes/freezes and have to force close to get back into the game. Freezes only seem to happen against AI oddly enough
---

blitzchung did that. Not Blizzard. They had rules sanctioning players from speaking of politics.
---
Good bot

Warcraft was not the first game Blizzard made.
---
They made Blackthorne, and before that they made Rock'n'Roll racing and The Lost Vikings (those were the days) as Silicon and Synapse.

The remnants of my broken soul after finally clearing the third n'zoth board from my warlock opponent only to be met with the 4th n'zoth. I think there's also a bit in the corner after I won a 20 minute game Vs n'zoth priest only to lose the next game in 3 minutes to flamewanker.
---
Yes I am. Biased towards human rights. I’m a fucking monster!
---
Preserve the gaming community, go protest with Hong Kong elsewhere. You protesting to a game developer doesn’t do SHIT. You think they can get anything done? You think Blizzard can just march into China and say “let Hong Kong be free!” and you think that works? If it doesn’t, THEN WHY ARE YOU PROTESTING HERE?
---
I just wish they’d be quiet if they don’t want to be a part of it and not ruin it for the people who do still want to be a part of it.
---
Choose it each time its available, collect up to 20. These 20 are account bound to all Tavern Brawl where you build a solo adventure deck until Blizzard codes it out. You end up with 20 chances for a 1 mana 20/20 Taunt Charge beast.

No. Blizzard is not destroying its own community, it’s destroying itself. YOU and people like you are destroying this community.

Im not trash talk them for trying, I just cynically  doubt ther motives and reason for trying.

That still doesn't make *Blizzard* the one that introduced politics into the game like you said. It's easy for other companies to say they wouldn't have done the same thing, but most of them really would probably do the same in that context.
---
"We’ve found that Control Warlock and Quest Warlock are the two best decks in the game if you’re interested in climbing from rank 1 to rank 5." Savage
---
Even the AI is boycotting blizzard.
---
I got offered 4 legendaries in one run yesterday. Kingsbane and Flame Leviathan were both options for 3 of those 4 choices. The run did not do well.
---
2015 boyo
---
It interacts with that only for each specific game.
---
Say you have 20 BFFs in your deck. At the start of the game, you play one, it summons all 20 out, making a 20/20, and also puts two 1/1s in your deck.
---
When you draw one of them, it will summon any currently existing BFFs in the deck, and then add another 2 to the deck.
---
If you draw one while you have a BFF on the board, it will combine with that one.
---
So you can do, for instance: 
---
Turn 1, play 20/20, hit face.
---
Turn 2, draw anotehr 1/1. Dont play it. Hit face (or taunt) again with 20/20. Now play that 1/1, it will combine with the 20/20 on the board and the one in deck, giving you a 22/22 which can attack this turn.
---
I won a couple of games when i had only 7 or 9 BFFs in my deck this way, being able to attack twice or three times in one turn. The 5 mana card that gives you two copies for 0 mana is very handy for this.
---
&gt;The uncraftable problem means getting a golden swashburglar that could disappear after the event end and the support claims that there is nothing wrong about that. 
---
I was not aware of that being an issue.
---
&gt;Class problem is a huge issues IMHO because they should be allowed to have flavored archtypes instead of being completely unable to do some things. 
---
Flavored archetypes can be fine, but Warrior shouldn't have access to face hitting spells, Paladin shouldn't have access to direct removal tools, Hunters should not have ample card draw, etc.
---
&gt;MTA has already learnt the lesson by giving green some kind of hard removal. 
---
Green creature removal is pretty bad or at least conditional relative to what other colors get.
---
White'll get a two mana outright exile anything spell in exchange for giving your opponent a card.
---
Green'll get a two mana damage spell conditioned on you already having a sizable creature on the board.
---
Flavored options a class or color wouldn't normally get are fine if and only if what they get isn't on par with what other classes or colors get.
---
&gt;The game is becoming more expensive overall with a weaker basic set while preorders are dropping according to surveys so something should be done about the dust economy.  
---
It really isn't as long as you don't allow the game to become too expensive. 
---
Sure, Highlander Mage lists can cost as much as twenty thousand dust, but the two thousand dust Murloc Shaman and four thousand dust Combo Priest list will beat it a majority of the time.
---
A weaker Classic set is ultimately better for the health of Standard as a format too.
---
What source do you have for those surveys too? Are they multi-thousand participant official Blizzard surveys or maybe one hundred participant surveys done exclusively by redditors?
---
In WoW Pirates are just another analog for Rogues, same how fire mages are just another analog for mages. Sure Jaina can use fire and arcane but she specializes in ice.
---
Pirates aren't some fantastical group in Warcraft, sure there are a bunch of pirate jokes and stereotypes but they're all plunderers and pretty fearsome. Just like how in real life pirates are romanticized despite them being generally pretty horrible.
---
The skin makes sense. It's also pretty cool in my opinion.
---
they probably would have received some sort of punishment, but not to the extent that blizchung received.
---
I have Shaman quest and all other stuff exept Shudderwock and I don't wanna spend dust. 
---
Any suggest for replace?
---
Dude, stop infantilizing the Chinese. They didn't invent the concept of a revolution or anything, but they're the only culture afaik to have euphemisms like "the mandate of heaven" to describe legitimateness of governments and when revolution becomes necessary.
---
Yup 2 sides to every coin. Did place 2nd in a 200 player MTT. Was definitely exhilarating. I will say i was winning every coin flip and such, literally nuts
---
You actually can reset it by starting a run with Hagatha and playing duplatransmogrifier on another minion, thereby replacing your Best Friends.
---
Wow, turns out adding wild cards to standard was indefensibly stupid.
---
No one could have ever seen this coming!
---
Yes, it is borderline insanity that you still do not have a good grasp of how things work.
---
Corporations do not have morals. They are all inherently on the side of money. They are not on one side of the other. The entire goal is to earn shareholders money. Whenever a social cause is brought up (such as Blizzard Pride Day), with rare exception it's because that has been determined by upper management to be most beneficial for profit. It is to be expected that any corporation will pander to the listening audience. In the case of multinational corporations, this pandering might conflict with previous ideals; say one thing to America, and another to China.
---
This is part of Capitalism. Don't hate the player - hate the game, for all players are subject to the same rules. You can boycott Blizzard and move on to another player, while remaining self-righteous and truly ignorant.
---
You are part of the outrage culture. Pliable minds often easily conform to these movements, without even realizing that they are wasting time and just putting their weak-mindedness and lack of critical thinking on full display.
---
Who said I was "so fucking sad" (edgy!) that my games are hurt? I'm just trying to educate people on Reddit.

I ended up with a similar scenario using Jr. Explorer and spells cost (x) less minions. Infinite buffs. Buffed one minion to 199 and killed the plague lord at 198 health.
---
Magic the gathering Arena. The upcoming Legends of Runeterra might be good. Also Gwent.
---
Runetrra is looking interesting.
---
Don't know if the developer is any more or less ethical than Blizzard tho.
---
This game is for scumbags anyway, so who cares.
---
Weird. It didn't show for me. But thanks
---
My guess is 8 wins.
---
It's probably too late, but I can't believe no one posted this Lich interaction with Blitzchung, Xi Jinping, and Activision-Blizzard Logo photoshopped onto it. Easiest 4K karma ever.
---
Are you trying to insinuate that I missed a year of Pogo Rogue being anything but trash? Because if so, then yeah, I was definitely in a coma.
---
This so much
---
Dream Quest is the best card game released in the last decade on any platform
---
Gwent : the Witcher card game, very F2P friendly, pretty complex and some interesting mechanics overall.
---
MTGArena : Magic on PC, but very different from MTGOnline when it comes to the interface. All hail the TCG King.
---
Eternal : an alternative to MTGA, much cheaper, and with on obvious lack of balance, which can be hilarious.
---
Elder Scrolls Legend : The elder Scroll TCG, not bad, but it lacks of something for me, and I don’t play it that often.
---
Legends of Runeterra : LoL TCG, still in Beta, you can still try to get a key, looks promising.
---
Artifact : OMEGALUL 
---
These are the big contenders to hearthstone, and very good alternatives (i think that MTGA will overcome Hearthstone in the next couple of years, so better get to it now and farm those Wildcards)
---
You don't need to tell people you're leaving

I hope they are

I actually play Warrior and Rogue. They are my favorite classes. I use to enjoy Priest but you can only OTK so many times.
---
Runeterra
---
It has to be. And if people buy it blizzard wins. 
---
It’s such a fucking good deal even I’m tempted to but then it’s like I’m a fuckin hypocrite if I do so lol.
---
Part of the incredulity here is that Blitzchung and both casters were banned the ~~very next day~~ very next business day (and less than two days), pretty much ASAP after people woke up.
---
Edit: Time zones.
---
What is the VPN doing?  Is it rerouting your traffic so it looks like you are in a different location or country?  I assume they have some data that shows you logged into your account from two far away places around the same time.
---
that statistic sounds pretty BS.
---
People have been calling Lebron a "circle jerking diva" recently for making a smart decision. Lebron stands with blizzard, end of stories.
---
Amazing. Haha.
---
China troll. pay no attention to this paid shill.
---
i did that but after filling his deck up once i could no longer use my hero power for the rest of the duel even if it dropped below max
---
I have an iPhone 10S Max and it’s crazy how laggy the game has gotten lately. Just in the Dungeon runs it’s like I play a card and have to wait 3-5 seconds for the game to catch up. It’s incredibly frustrating.
---
What do you get
---
Vpns change your IP address right? And thread them through different countries? To blizzard that would look like you are allowing your account to be accessed by bots in different countries. That would be my guess. The system just sees your account being accessed from several different countries and different computers.
---
Dude don’t fuckin listen to blizzard with that shit lol. It was a hypocritical statement because they literally have something is the game that should be the weakness of that class lol. Fuck when they said that they printed Underbelly Murloc lol. Ignore blizzard man lol.
---
I have used it in the past to change my location to access some sites that you can't use from my country.
---
Bring defile to classic! Best card ever printed when you combine power, style, theme, and the way both sides have to play around it
---
As long as I plant the seed in one mind - I’m a happy man. Stand up for what you believe is right in this world and dig those heels in. The world will turn for the worse when good men start to sit idle. Never ending battle. Pick your side.
---
So you can imagine why, in the midst of the largest backlash they've ever dealt with, they weren't trigger happy on an additional ban?
---
What is even the implication here, that the reason blizzard didn't ban then immediately was because they're secretly communist, and the way they show that is by not banning a pro Hk activist?
---
Or that blizzard is racist, and didn't ban them cause they're white?
---
Or that they're nationalist and didn't ban them cause they're American?
---
Hint none of these make any sense.
---
What is your vpn app and what/where does it connect to
---
I feel the same way. I haven't played in weeks and I feel guilty. Damn you, Blizzard.
---
 all come to the conclusion; wrong for me, that blizzard supports totalitarian regimes because it has banned the boy
---
Well put! 
---
Regarding your last point: 
---
&gt; Here's the real contradiction though, this same mob, also used it's outrage to get the original ban halved and his prize money returned. So it's not as if the mob has a moral objection to blizzard capitulating to the outrage mob.
---
I hadn't really thought of that, but you're exactly right. The problem with the circlejerk raging on /r/news and /r/worldnews right now is that they many appear to lack awareness that people were *calling* for their ban prior to this, instead understanding the situation purely as "Blizzard banned yet another team for anti-China dissent."
---
Yes, Blizzard fucked up in the first place, but this situation is a lot more complicated than it'd initially appear. Different people are upset (or not) for different reasons depending on how much they know, but one thing's for sure: Blizzard literally can't do *anything* right in the public's eye right now.
---
What they did was like if someone who was an anti-Semite was in an interview where the subject matter nothing at all related to Jewish people and the interview was like "Before you go, tell us your thoughts on the Jews."
---
It was tunnelbear, and I used to to connect somewhere random outside my country
---
At first it wasn’t bad in my opinion either but then it comes to America supporting them and then blizzard didn’t give them a backlash at all. Then people where upset that it’s double standards so blizzard does damage control and gives them a hard punishment which doesn’t even help blizzard. 
---
Most people are upset with how much the guy loss then anything really.
---
~~NA Quest trade. Goramier#1615. I will play warlock and lose but will play cards to complete another quest. Just hit up aggro for fast win and quest trades.~~
---
DONE
---
Ahahaha, this is amazing
---
As I told you in the previous post, the system might thought your deck tracker (a 3rd party program) as a bot. Did you post this possibility to the support?
---
I laughed at that statement too. Even before Quest Shaman they had Hagatha the Witch and Underbelly Angler.
---
Explain pls
---
Not that this has any real bearing but for what purpose?
---
Yes I mentioned every tip that was given to me in the previous post. We have now figured out that botting was not the issue.

There was a recent Reddit post that got outed for boosting. He claims up and down that he got banned for travelling out of state, but it turned out people outside of the country were accessing his account and boosting.

Another ban with no reason. This is just wrong. I’m always trying to fight for the customer until they provide a proof that You actually broke the rules.
---
Prepare to hear from people that “You shouldn’t have botted in the first place”. I hope You can get at least proof or better reasoning from them.
---
Btw. Anyone else noticed that there are more bans recently? I guess there is new plague lord of bans.
---
That's exactly what I meant....
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Exactly this. Blizzard is fucking pathetic.
---
Isn't the initial deck building mechanic choosing between 3 random cards?
---
It was for pokemon go haha, tried to catch those I couldn't. Didn't realy work to be honest.
---
Edit: also this was a long time ago, back when it was first released. Do bans go back that far?
---
Not sure that I agree the initial ban was wrong, but I do agree that the mob is insane.
---
Can I ask what the front page is?
---
That happened to me I was playing doc boom and my opponent used a draw card and died to bombs while missing leathal
---
Something that offers more value, generally.  Could go with Phaoris if you have it, or some big legendary like rag.  It's hard to beat a hand duplication, but really it does just give you more fuel, so something big and powerful.
---
As it's one card, and not one that you always have to rely on (a lot of games it can just sit in hand or be a 5/5 for 5 for tempo) it's THE most important card.
---
All those “news” subreddits are horrible circlejerks, they’re pretty much r/politics lite
---
Thats exactly the point you tool. This thread is about china and blizzard not your foolish gameplay issues with diablo. Even if you were replying to them YOU BOTH ARE OFF TOPIC. Not to mention you clearly have no argument at all here because you dont even understand what the threads about, cry off topic on being called out about your hypocrisy, fail to see your solution just funnels more money to china, and then say im antagonizing you for pointing out the stupidity of going to PoE over blizz.
---
Are you a republican? Cause you project your own accusations onto other people
---
Again I never said i was taking a large stance towards the corporate injustice of Blizzard (I still actively play World of Warcraft) But I feel that quitting Hearthstone is a good start in showing my solidarity.
---
I am not religious either. But something created us. And whoever or whatever that did, they gave us free will and a voice and hands and legs and a dick and everything else. All to be used. Of course you also have to survive... And if misusing any of these things jeopardizes that then that's your own fault. People are free to retaliate is what I'm saying lol
---
The "trick" part of trick or treating
---
Just delete your post buddy
---
I will post here as soon as I get an update from blizzard. However, going from botting to boosting  somehow feels like a minor victory so far. And this proves that blizzard could have made a mistake.
---
And how long did it take for the consequences to happen? Nobody is saying they shouldn't be punished. The team even pointed out how they weren't punished and thought that was wrong.
---
R/boycottblizzard is gaining traction
---
Why haven't Blizzard banned the commentators like they did in the Blitzchung one? Make it equal huh?
---
People want to pitchfork together, its fun.
---
If you can't grasp my confession and stance, I feel you should take some time to reflect and reconsider instead of insulting me.
---
I am trying to show my support, I don't understand how that can be the subject of scrutiny for yourself.
---
I'm pretty sure the ban was done to remain consistent with their PR statement on Friday. They have to try and at least be consistent with what they said, especially since they were already getting a bit of flak for not banning these students in the first place.
---
The ban is not that they are pro-Chinese, racist, not white or whatever. They just want the opportunity to continue working and distributing their product in China and the only way to do that is to appease Mainland China. Unfortunately, Blizzard lied and simply stated the bans are soley because the stream was hijacked for political statements, which is something that did happen and by Right of Association Blizzard is free to ban as much as they like.
---
The issue is that they have only exercised this power to this extent once, specifically removing earnings part and the issue Blitzchung was raising up is sympathetic to Western ideology. Also Blizzard should have just came out and said exactly what everyone was thinking, that they have an obligation to their Chinese playerbase to keep a working relationship with it's government to deliver the products they want. Pretending like China didn't have anything to do with this is disingenuous at best and downright a lie at worst. After all, Blizzard has made political statements with its own broadcasts and video games that "risk to offend other groups" before.
---
Well you cant post your leaving and get 1k upvotes, only downvoted, so hopefully that clears out most of the karma whores, the rest will just take time and hopefully the mods will start to take at least some action to stop all the hate against the game, I mean its a subreddit dedicated TO the game, not against it, its not constructive criticism to hate hate hate
---
Hong Kong said we can bring them back

I dont have a problem with it, I have a problem with you pretending its meaningful, supporting HK can go on the HK subreddit, not a hearthstone one
---
Does it need to be new to the blitzchung situation to be posted here? It’s still new and relevant in the context of blizzards recent behavior.
---
It'd help if they were just up-front about the situation.  Did you read their statement (the Brack one, not the Weibo one)?  It was anything but an actual response to the problem.  Basically the crisis form of the familiar "we hear you, we're looking into it", but written in stilted, awkward English instead of the normal conversational tone.
---
I really don't appreciate being lied to.  Saying "China had nothing to do with it" on the one hand, and "we will protect the dignity of China" on the other, does not add up.
---
We already knew after we read 'their', so no need to clarify that.
---
OP says he doesn't believe Blizzard and that's literally the entirety of the post. After a week of posts like this, we're not going to continue rewarding this circlejerk with front-page exposure.
---
The NBA aspect is irrelevant to Hearthstone/Blizzard and doesn't constitute anything "new"
---
If you want to discuss the Blitzchung situation, you are absolutely welcome to do so, but we are going to demand just a bit of effort goes into the actual threads. Currently, this is but another repost of a repost.
---
Im glad you've decided to cut out tje middleman and give your money straight to china
---
Yeah, best we just forget about Hong Kong. So annoying to hear about it when I only just heard about it yesterday.
---
I'd argue that the Adam Silver situation is still relevant and new. He said this 3 hours ago. It's pretty clear proof that China is asking for punishments and bannings. 
---
Blizzard said that China had no influence, but it's clear that China is pushing its weight around in the situations that call for it. This merits discussion.
---
He is speaking the language of the gods
---
Very cool :D
---
Why did it take blizzard 7 days to ban them but only 7 minutes to ban blitzchung?
