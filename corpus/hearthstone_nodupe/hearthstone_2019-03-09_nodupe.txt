Exploiting friends for money like a true capitalist.
---
I have a little tear in my eye. They grow up so fast...
---
Jesus Christ no. Classes have limitations on their cards so they can’t abuse them. Can you imagine a prep+psychic scream or resurrection+grommash? It would be hell. 
---
Not here yet...
---
Considering how henchmen are going to be a thing in the next set's pve content I wouldn't be surprised if there was an easter egg for playing hench clan thug against a certain opponent. It would basically be just a brief quip from the boss similar to how Splintergraft is repulsed by playing woodcutter's axe against her in monster hunt. 
---
People just don't understand vote with your wallet. It is the easiest it has ever been to be a smart consumer, from availability of endless information on products to the on-demand access to a trillion alternatives. The only thing HS is doing clearly better than all other digital card games is it's polish, which has remained as unchanged as the rest of the game all these years. So you are 100% correct in the fact that innovation does not make Blizzard money, the things that make them money do (lol). The cool board art and full voice acting for every single card are great aspects to the game, and unfortunately all it needs to maintain its place as a cash cow.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's not healthy to lament these things, though. Yes, Blizzard can keep just snail pace nudging HS along, and while that feels like a betrayal of how the free market should work, its the free market working as intended. Access to alternatives doesn't guarantee HS must be at the cutting edge of digital card tech and mechanics, it guarantees that if HS in a shitty state you can play something else. The current dev care and pace is below what I would accept for a game I play constantly, so I just don't. Some tavern brawls and arena now and then, cash in my rewards a week or two into an expansion while hyping myself up on all the reveals and cool streamer content, get a couple weeks of grinding and self experimentation in. The amount of content that I can successfully pull value out of is only so much, but that's fine, Ill do something else or play something else outside of that.
---
For context, I'm a beta Destiny fan. The game came out and because I am a smort boi, I did my research and I was much less surprised and hurt by the reality of the content to be found. Regardless, it perfectly recaptured the grandeur and gun play of Halo all while telling a sick Mythic story entirely outside of the game (I just happened to enjoy this), so I was hooked. For me, this is Destiny's "HS polish". Now, that was like 5+ years ago. The only way I can maintain a love for that game the way that I have is that I stop playing when I have to, I have skipped some DLC and bought others after waiting for reception. HS and Destiny both call for a grind, so you can fall into sunk cost fallacy or convince yourself to suffer through some of the grind to reap worth-while rewards, but you should only allow that so much. Currently, I'm pretty 'on' Destiny at the moment because it's in a great state atm. That state being a seasonal release staggering, perfect for being 'on' a couple weeks consecutively every couple months. I'm currently very 'off' of HS, as it has been in rough shape for years. If it was my main game, I'd be tearing my hair out.
---
Trade with another person that has the same quest. 
---
You get 160g in total.
---
If they don't have 2 mana they will not use it
---
Opinion: this is every Tavern Brawl
---
3 or 4 don't remember. 
---
Custom in what way? 
---
I agree, i found it very practical when i learned it, but in this particular thread i think it's not so much rejection against the word but me trying to casually impose a grammar correction (that ended up not even being a grammar rule) in a discussion about the value of a hearthstone expansion, seing the bright side i learned something new which is nice.
---
I thought of doing that aswell, that was around kft release, everybody was running lich king. I read his name, and changed it back to english... why would they even TRY to translate lich? 
---
I might change it for a bit to see how different it is now,  but man lich king got me pissed off lol.
---
Dude, I fought that goddamn deck last night with my black and white vampire deck. It was one of the most insane games I ever played!
---
I was literally getting hit for 40 lifesteal damage a turn towards the end while dishing out 45. I topdecked just enough to stay alive and whittled him down over like 10 turns as he had gained over 100 life during that time.
---
It's at times like that I wish I could add people as friends to talk about it, lol. We'll get there!
---
4000 Dust
---
Some ideas that would be good as permanent modes:
---
60 card decks, no duplicates
---
Best of 3 with 10 card side-decks 
---
Commons and rares only
---
I've invested heavily in Hearthstone and am hesitant move away.  I do share the same opinions that Hearthstone has gotten stale.  
---
In terms of price to return how does MGTA compare to Hearthstone?
---
Is there a mode similar to Wild mode that let's me use cards that have rotated out?
---
How much money would I have to spend to have 2 or 3 competitive decks?
---
As a heads up, you double posted the top 10 from standard, and didn't post the wild one.
---
wrong bananas... 
---
This game needs more hype.  Similar to magic as you say, f2p friendly, and has a huge amount of account-level interaction (for lack of a better term) with faction leveling and all the rewards that come with it, and the huge amount of achievements which they keep adding to with every expansion.  Draft rewards monthly in addition to rank rewards.  Not that there aren't problems, I mean it exists, there will be problems, but I feel Hearthstone needs to learn a bit from their competitors.  Alternatively - I thought MTGA was a let-down. :shrug:
---
It's a game ending! ~~for the person who plays it~~
---
Decklist?
---
It's a marketing stunt like literally every other AMA you see on /r/AMA done by celebrities. Fuck that.
---
I don’t think it’s inherently flawed at all but it’s annoying it has to cut into the tavern brawl slot for everyone who doesn’t want to do it.  I like the arena structure way more than climbing ladder, but enjoy deck building more than drafting. Brawliseum is my main candidate for a new permanent game mode, ideally rotating format like the new Arena
---
I've heavily invested in Hearthstone as you.  How much money would I have to spend to have 1 or 2 competitive decks and in terms of pack rarity how often do rare cards cost?
---
So this is mostly (60% to be exact?) the same as if you went to HSReplay and sorted cards by deck win rate.
---
It’d be cool to map this against a Pareto efficiency chart with mana, health, attack to suss out the strength of card text relative to base stats. Then you could rank the keywords’ strength, or just find out which free form text is strongest.
---
Do the intro for Knights of the Frozen Throne solo adventure. It gives a legendary Death Knight card for completing it. It will help you win games on the ladder. 
---
If you want to it to be strictly f2p player, you can totally be that. I started playing this game 5-6 months ago, I haven't spent on anything apart from the welcome bundle. 
---
If you can afford it, do buy it. It gives 10 classic packs and a legendary dragon for 5 dollars. Which it totally worth it. 
---
Keep a track of the packs you open in the beginning. Every expansion will give a legendary card in the first 10 packs. Also it is worth noting that three expansion are going out of rotation at the start of next month. Try to avoid buying a lot of packs from those. 
---
Watch a few basic videos on YouTube on deck building. Don't waste much dust on crafting cool cards like I did. I wasted a lot of dust. Only craft cards you want at the moment. 
---
Once you get the hang of the game, you can craft anything you want. 
---
After you have a couple of decks made, start by playing ranked games. It gives classic packs after every 5 levels, I think. So you will get a lot of cards to build decks. 
---
TIL?
---
&gt; It was a huge letdown.
---
See, you're problem is that you had any expectations from Team 5 at all. Why would you expect anything positive from them? When was the last time they actually answered any hard questions with something that isn't a non-answer? This is exactly the same AMA they did several times already. They don't say anything at all, waste your time expecting something that isn't shit, turns out you get shit, ignore every important question, "answer" some semi-important questions with shit like they are looking into it, they have plans but not now (by the way, it's never now and never will be) and other shit. Like, how can people actually not learn from the one year that is getting repeated for the 5th time?
---
Well except turn 3 or 4 barnes yes, it's a great feature that wild have.
---
Just using your data:
---
&gt;The ARPU on a monthly basis for a Hearthstone player is about c.$6 a month [...]  10-12mn MAU for Hearthstone
---
$6 x 10mn x 12 months
---
Maybe I'm misunderstanding something
---
Got Hakkar from my fourth pack but if he didn’t pop up it would have been straight up 160 dust.
---
Brawl. Every time I've seen this bug for myself, or reported online, the perpetrator was Brawl. 
---
It's a game, not a girlfriend. If you were "investing" your time instead of playing something that you enjoyed because it provided said enjoyment, then you were doing it wrong. But fuck me for going to r/hearthstone because I like Hearthstone, right? How utterly unreasonable of me. 
---
They're always really cool matchups. I'd be interested in how this gets implemented without being just a randomonium brawl.
---
Also takkal + giants, voidlord on 3 or malganis, or sweet 0 mana double 5/5 on 5 + 7/7 or something like that and 0 mana 5/5 with a bunch of secrets till turn 5. :-)
---
thanks for proving my point :)
---
He actually cannot get mad for having a ~31% outcome  happening when he himself lucked out on hitting ~4% earlier!
---
&gt; Who are they? 
---
The shareholders are their users. Everyone else is nothing but a cow they are milking dry.
---
Why Kalinos has his text changed?
---
Am I missing something?
---
I guess that makes a lot more sense 🤦‍♂️
---
Yup hardly buy packs with USD anymore this game has been an adequate boat ride that had really declined in 2018 with all of the mediocre expansions full of low power level cards cause power creep but last time I preordered their 50 pack bundle crap was in Grand Tournament and boy was that a let down so now I believe preorders are just a crappy way for companies to take a chunk of your money upfront for a cheap novelty like a card back or a hero portrait 
---
Hmmm what do we have here....
---
He can. He only has a 1/5 chance of failing.
---
It's a cool brawl. They should ban spirit of the shark, though then it might just become an OTK brawl.
---
ah yes, forgot about them for a second, but hey, at least there are diverse decks... i think so ? 
---
It’s a monotonous nightmare
---
The thing I don't really see said enough here is the actual reason they don't do this. There are not enough players. Wild already has longer wait times than standard. These modes would Pull almost exclusively from current wild. Wait times go up. People stop playing and go play standard. 
---
yea but are teh rewards better for new players looking to get max resources for the 150 gold price before the new xpac?
---
Yeah, that´s why I love wild, except these early cheating mechanics. The variety of decks is really cool!
---
Found an aggro player.
---
Lol, what a joke.  You can compare any meta to any other.  You were trying to say this is the 'BY FAR the worst constructed meta' and we're arguing that there are other metas way worse than this one.  Putting this one in the middle.  Plenty diverse and balanced as strengths, too similar past metas as it's significant negative.
---

---
Could be due to the new game director that we're seeing some improvements. Nothing ever gets done with BBrode as game director. 
---
&gt; they are busy working at their development job
---
With the state of the game, I highly doubt that. Outside of the art department, I'm not sure Team 5 is working even half the time they spend at work.
---
Now we may hope for a change, but eh, don't think that something will change
---
Without Shadow Visions, Lyra, and Radient Elemental, all forms of Combo Priest become far, far too inconsistent to be considered.
---
Completely agree. It's a tough balance because I agree there should be some sort of rotation so you can't play the same exact deck everytime, but also with it be being Brawliesuem or whatever people would be pissed wasting their money on a deck they don't really like. 
---
And if they get hall of fame you'll get your dust back anyways.
---
We have new cards now, though.
---
Maybe Kadhgar instead of Medivh?
---
I think so if you netdeck and know the strategies. I've had much more luck here versus Arena
---
got another 12 wins with the exact list :) 
---
https://i.imgur.com/ok9bDNy.jpg
---
Tortollan Primalist is super strong, but for the next run I might cut Zihi, wasnt that useful and I often didn't play it in fear of getting combo'd.
---
Demoman should still work out okay.
---
I think so too... They don´t even bother to answer any wild related questions... :/
---
I played Gwent. I prefer Gwent's animated cards for sure. I do think the overall presentation of HS is more enjoyable, though. 
---
To be fair, that is like an hour longer than most Tavern Brawls......
---
&gt;Lol, what a joke.
---
reminds me of the day i opened twin emperor. i was soo happy . maybe some day c'thun will be playable
---
We can hope.
---
Just run super agro murloc decks(except for druid and hunter). For hunter run some spell hunter deck, and for druid go with jades(easy win for minium dust cost)
---
I was gonna make a shitpost with 2000g instead changing the body to instead being about finding a minimum wage job but honestly it's 3am here and I gotta sleep.
---
Quality meme. This week's brawl could have been made much better with just a few quality bans.
---
Well, they took Rush from Shadowverse, so why not?
---
Nonsense. Some are only days old. Some months old. This level of hate's been going on for approaching a year, so that's not too old to prove my point.
---
More importantly, that link only searches OPs and includes people fighting the term "shill," but there are examples of ones using it as an insult. If there were an easy search for comments, I'd link that since there's tons of them.
---
It's losing dust if it will never see play, which could be the case after the rotation. Absolutely no solid reason to not wait for the rotation. 
---
Balanced is fine, stagnant is not.  I feel like the game has barely changed since mid Witchwood set.  And when Wild did (Star Aligner) they nerfed it to the ground.
---
can remember it, that was the moment when i stopped spending money 
---
Wow, you hit so many spots on the "r/hearthstone whiner bingo board"
---
&gt;smugness
---
&gt;annoyingly bringing up MtGA
---
&gt;claims he's played since beta, but he's totally done with HS now
---
I haven't played a single game from Blizzard Entertainment in 18 months. My daily gaming routine was non-stop Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch. In the beginning I was so happy and loved every minute of it, and after a few years, I became this bitter old angry man where I was no longer having fun - I was upset and addicted. These games were clearly taking a toll on my mental health, my relationships, my work, my friends, etc. It took me a while to figure it all out, but once I realized my life would be better without this awful company getting the best of my emotions 24/7, I uninstalled everything and walked away. My life has never been better.
---
Every now and then I'll pop into these forums and see if anything has changed. I honestly want to give Hearthstone a second chance, but it's just the same old Blizzard. I feel like just checking up on things and watching a stream here and there is enough to satisfy the itch without actually playing. No new features, same terrible metas, same bullshit OTK garbage with no real ability to counter-play, win-rates completely controlled by "match-making"(which I am convinced is not 100% random), no tournament mode, no new rewards, most of my favorite streamers are still gone, etc.
---
Life is to short to do the same things over and over again every day and be angry doing it. This game is clearly not living up to the expectations we all had when we first started 5+ years ago. The fact that they announced that 2019 will be more of the same with no new modes planned gives me some closure. I feel confident I made the right choice in stopping, and I'm sure many other people will feel the same way.
---
Wait, Kazakus is a dragon...? Can trolls be dragons? Is that legal?
---
Epic one would say 
---
That is normal feel for someone who played too much. You need pause from HS so you will start to miss it again. That is how human mentality works.
---
3 mana deal 2 dmg to all minions both on board and hand. Has lifesteal too so you can couple it with thalnos for that sweet 30hp heal
---
Did you just assume his gender?
---
You can share comments, and even if there are a few comments on old posts, that really doesn't invalidate anything that I've said as generally no one is calling anyone a Blizzard shill outside of joking. 
---
That’s how I feel, I enjoy big boys and big Prost does just that. It’s pretty interesting that you’re expected to not play it on ladder but you also can’t play it in casual.
---
Minimum Viable Product, squeeze the consumer and hope a few whales with gambling addictions get hooked. Sounds like Activision/Blizzard tbh. How bad do they have to get for people to be fed up? Honest question. 
---
Clearly Glitter Moth is the best. Anyone that suggests otherwise is just trolling.
---
&gt; even if there are a few comments on old posts, that really doesn't invalidate anything 
---
In other words, you're right even when you're proven you're wrong.
---
What do you mean by craft cards that will be Hall of famed?
---
This is what happens with constructed brawls with a gimmick. There’s always a Tavern Brawl meta. It’s just a little more serious this time due to the insane amount of gold you can earn. I did 5 runs with maly druid using gloop sprayer and I didn’t get any runs under 5 wins. Most actually averaged around 8-9. I’m not playing for full profit. I’m just playing decks I like and if I can break even, the great!
---
How is it ending in 5 torture? When you do an arena you have like a 50% chance of getting a gold denomination that ends in 5, so it switches back and forth constantly. 
---
What rank are you? And what rank did u climb to using that deck?
---
I love this idea, too. Nice suggestion for how to handle this!
---
I can see why they don't have this, if a lot of F2P players have a constant reminder of "you've never been able to complete a set and you never will". On the other hand, I can definitely see the subset of completionists opening their wallets much wider. Scary.
---
Well people are always complaining about something. And its not a blizzard only thing. You cannot pleasure every customer, in any business. 
---
Go read WoW Forums they have been littered with complaints since the game exists basically. Still millions of people played it, so they surely have done soemthing right.  
---
The average MTG player sucks at MTG too though. After a lot of experience I am an above average HS player, and from the start I was a pretty average MTG player.
---
Using pre-con decks I won my first practice game in MTG (at a FNM draft), I went 3/5 in matches in my draft the same day. In MTG Arena I went 4/3 in my first draft and win games against actual constructed decks in ranked using a starter deck.
---
If we had more intelligent and active thinkers like you in the Hearthstone (and really gaming) consumer population we would start to see change. Kudos
---
I only play arena when it's free. So I have an unusable 5g until I get a lucky free arena run.
---
What is that coming out of his bucket hat...?
---
Dad legend.  I'm to lazy to push legend.
---
I had so much fun in the mtg planeswalkers games with my friends playing two-headed giant, 4 player free-for-all (1v1v1v1), 2v1 against bosses, etc. There's so many things they could do
---
You are not invested, you have spent time and money on a service. It's gone forever and you got something (hopefully enjoyable) in return. Do not fall for sunk cost fallacy
---
Every game that starts with Baku makes me not care that I'm playing big priest. 
---
His'er'm* my bad
---
Wilfred Fizzlebang is the trifling gnome that summoned jaraxxus right? 
---
It's so clear and blatant. You are right on the money. 
---
Same
---
I could see this taking the spot for "slowest Tavern Brawl ever" if everyone starts playing unstable evolution. Still, I would definitely enjoy this. Even if you could only mix two classes together, would be a lot of fun. 
---
Wow I haven't noticed this till you said it lol.
---
:D
---
I loved the deck before all the nerfs! I don't play much ranked but I was finally ready to try climbing higher because the deck felt comfortably competitive against everything. It's a shame...
---
Thanks! It's honestly just one small change at a time, and one day you might surprise yourself with where you are relative to where you were. :)
---
not in this brawl. rogue is insanely op. you can draw like 8 cards, double fungal mancer, and alexstraza off like 3 mana if you set up spirit the turn before.
---
Combo is the activation requirement, he gains the buffs for every card after. Stating just combo would mean it could only get 1 buff. 
---
No love for Gloomdeer? Fearvenison? Wait what was the name of that card...
---
I keep rotating between the Starfall with another Wild Growth or another Astral Tiger.  If you can get the Astral Tiger off twice before Unda it turns into a lot of fun.  There's definitely room to improve the deck.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
You said it.
---
I hate both of you guys-shame on you for playing cancer.
---
I doubt it.  I could sworn that I've seen this him a few times now, just deleting the post when he takes his meds and gets a few wins again.
---
my point was that wall priest was going to die in the next expansion. The combo needs more than just a minion with tons of hp, it needs set up, stall(to draw it), and consistency that rez cards gave it.
---
Without it, divine spirit+inner fire are meme tier combos
---
Too slow as in beating good Aggro/Midrange strategies or pressuring OTK decks when you consider your other options.  The Midrange Hunters are probably bad if they are losing consistently.  You aren't going to beat the Even Paladins and combo Druids.  Secret Paladin is probably favored and Odd Warrior is a toss up if they know what they are doing.  That's Tier 1.
---
Wall Priest and Cube Hunter will beat you, probably Zoolock as well.  Odd Rogue might not but Miracle Rogue will and you should out armor Control Priest.  That's Tier 2.
---
Odd Mage is a low Tier 3 deck but any deck can hit Rank 5.  Hitting Rank 5 with this deck doesn't really say much or mean it is suddenly viable.   If this was /r/competitiveHS you'd have to submit a decent sample size to at least backup your claims.
---
That's what they want you to think
---
Yes, but that's not the point. I have never spent gold on the account as it's an alt account, nor do I plan on doing so. My alt accounts have over 100k gold combined.
---
Good thing I am not poor and literally give a shit about money and can buy the entire expansion day 1 if I want. 
---
$200 is literally nothing to me.  Thats probably like $5 to you
---
All they had to do was ban a handful of cards like they did with the eggs in a previous brawl and this would be a whole different format.
---
/r/iamveryrich

I'm in awe of the fact that you're not only invested enough in C'thun to continue playing it in wild, but decide to play c'thun with mage, even those it's one of the least-supported C'thun classes (barring those that didn't get c'thun cards like shaman and hunter). You've awakened my curiosity, what list do you use?
---
You are getting back about 12-25% of your value each time you do this.  It's really inefficient.
---
Hopefully not the "greatest champions of Azeroth" that Tirion brought to fight at Icecrown. 
---
Brawl is balanced out by having permanent access to your commander, at least.
---
I'm not sure about high roll mode. I play to counter and I don't play bone mare and have gone to 12 wins. Opening hand wants draw. To counter all the rogues that are playing the typical lists you want primordial or giggling.
---
I won al my games on turns 3-5. More typically 4. Giggling really messes with the game plan of attacking face but only delays for a turn, two at max.
---
Same here. It probably won't stop me clicking every five minutes though to check.
---
You could always try dumping them into a Furnacefire Colossus. 
---
Sprint seems really slow. I've never only seen turn 7 in about 2 of 20 games. But prep is better used for other uses. Minstrel draws better.
---
I agree, what I'd like from wild is to be able to play decks I used to enjoy. But to do that you kind of need to be able to play them in the meta that they were created in. I'd like a rotating legacy mode which grabs the standard card pool from different periods in HS history. Obviously not everyone wants this from wild though.
---
&gt; They come back to subreddit talking about having more communication and listening to feedback until they disappear after the expansion hits and basically implement nothing except new cards, which they were going to do any way.
---
a smarter PR tactic would be to have planted questions asking for things that you were already going to do, then when you push out the update it looks like you reacted swiftly to consumer demands
---
I disagree. There is a counter for even the best turn 1 like coin shark bonemare. Giggling is great. It takes a lot to break through, I've won many games shadow stepping giggling to stall for lethal or a vilespine.
---
I've played snowfury giant overload shaman in both standard and wild, and this right here just speaks to me on so many levels. Everyone should play that deck just for the pure insanity

What does the product being about a video game have to do with you being pathetic? It could be anything, that kind of behavior would be bad for the industry and for consumers.

I think it's too complicated, and the "wait for rotation" scenario is definitely an issue. 
---
I'd like them not to go quite as far as this. Given the fact that any solution has to be good for Blizzard and the Players, I'd like them to allow purchase of packs for gold (increases the player base) at full price and also offer discounted Wild Bundles for money (get revenue). 
---
There's no need to mess around with Dust values, or go too far in enabling new Wild players to get a head start on existing players, which would happen with Full Set Purchase options.
---
I gave the game a chance after Ben Brode left, and I left the game an update later. In fact I left CCGs all together even tho I still log in to Shadowverse from time to time. Activision Blizzard is effectively trying to kill off their IP one by one, and I'm in under no circumstances will support them again. It's really sad seeing such a beloved company plagued by greed and empty promises. 
---
At least you didn't have to pay 5$ for that sense of pride and accomplishment, you earned it all on your own!

Because of the context, for the first time in my life I understand what that phrase really means.
---
Well I am not a big fan of RNG so I thought if you relate secrets to mana cards to mana cards it would be more interesting less RNG more puzzle.
---
Corrupted Blood no longer benefits from Spell Damage.
---
This is what the Patch notes from beginning february says so I'd think it wouldn't worl but never tested it.
---
The only Real issue I have with Big Priest is that it's Way too difficult to deal with when you're playing non-conventional. slower decks. Reno decks of any class struggle to deal with the 'big dude swarm' late in the game, and it's not like you have any real means of counterplay against it. Odd Warrior stands no chance Whatsoever, at least Reno decks can attempt to fish multiple hard removal spells with Kazakus.  
---
The only decks I find can Somewhat handle big priest are Evenlock and anything that is Hyper aggro, such as Odd pally or Rogue. The Mecha'thun variant I run can also race Big priest, provided they don't draw Barnes on curve.  
---
I feel like this deck would be reeled in Very effectively by nerfing Eternal Servitude. Make the spell resurrect the Exact copy of the minion pulled by Barnes / Shadow Essence. This'll give opponents some Much needed breathing room in the midgame, while still allowing Big Priest to retain its powerful late-game. On-curve Barnes will be Much less threatening as well, though I feel they should leave Resurrect as is, so as not to Completely gutter the highroll aspect of the deck. 
---
I get about one in three ragers. One time i had an opponent tell me that roping was against the ToS of the game. I work from home and was taking a break when a work call came. I roped twice. I felt really bad and then hit up a blizzard tech support just to ask. They said that's stupid. Roping is part of the game. The mind game.
---
Legacy and Vintage *are* curated. But the formats are also capable of policing themselves to a degree, which is why bans/restrictions are less common. 
---
Wild clearly has no ability to do that as a format, so the only other answer is nerfs. If people want Wild to be a fun, popular format, then something needs to change. 
---
Mostly because at the time entomb wasn’t a card, infinite value wasn’t a thing lie it is now. Fatigue damage and card advantage SERIOUSLY mattered (and imo the game was better for it)
---
I miss control warrior va control priest LOE matches
---
A FIGHT?? COUNT ME IN!!!
---
Thank you so much! Really appreciate it.
---
People don't want to use weaker decks. People want a format where decks are *balanced* against each other, and where they can actually play games of Hearthstone. You wanting to play with strong decks doesn't contradict that, and the fact that you seem to think it does tells me you don't understand what those people are asking for. 
---
People aren't asking for a lower power level. People are asking for a *balanced* format where they can play actual games of Hearthstone. There's a difference, and having one doesn't mean you can't have the other. 
---
Honestly, I doubt Team 5 knows the answers to a lot of those questions themselves.

Make a ticket on blizzard website
---
I know. It's pretty simple.
---
 But old adventures was better once again for this. You would see the rewards before you bought it. Did you want brann and elise buy until those wings. Did you want emperor buy until that wing and leave the rest.
---
 With the new adventure you get packs which MIGHT give you a legendary and you don't even know if it is good or not and even resets your pity timer.
---
The new adventures strictly worse for the consumers and you cannot provide anything which proves otherwise. It's not a hard concept 
---
Why Enforcer instead of Primordial Drake? 
---
Nice. I remember meeting an odd pally probably around those ranks and we had a fun chat. Most players I met in wild are incredibly nice, can’t remember one guy who was rude or anything. Oddly enough he acted similarly when we were talking. Just out of curiosity, what is his name? I might actually have him in my friends list.

Hell no! Come on man, there are many F2P players out there. Give them a chance to breathe. But, if they do increase the pack price(say 25%) then they must increase the coin reward for the daily quests and the coin reward for winning three games. 
---
Yep, its "fun" alright. *sarcasm*
---
I have been playing since day 1. I think this game is great and feel like the devs are doing a great job. I play 3 games a day on average so im thinking the problem is when you are playing the game a lot more than that?
---
Of course people would like more gold in general, not much of an opinion to have here.
---
The problem here is from Blizzard's side: will they implement this? Probably not. Why? Probably because "greedy". 
---
This would honestly be a much more easy and "fair" addition to the economy instead of some "free arena ticket stuff".
---
The pleasure is mine.

---
Same here, but a pleasant surprise.
---
It's actually not as difficult as it might seem. Most of the cards in the deck are completely irrelevant. He just has to wait until he draws the Auctioneers (Withwood Piper helps make the draws a little easier). After that you just have to know what to do with a few key cards as you get them and make sure you sacrifice one of the Auctioneers when you get to 9 cards in hand. All the rest of the cards you get from the draws are just played quickly and forgotten about.
---
All that being said, you have to do all this on the fly and quickly before the turn ends. It's very easy to get confused and mess it up under pressure, which he did a couple of times before this clip.
---
Any way you slice it, it's impressive as fuck and really fun to look at. Believe it or not, Dog does type of thing a lot faster and more accurately than Toast, or just about anyone else for that matter. His APM is pretty nuts and he very rarely makes with these sorts of combos.

Mecha'thun. Death Knight Uther. Gahz'rilla. Just to name a few ways. Or even get to 30/30 Jades or scavenging hyenas. Lots of ways, just need to get creative. 
---
Most of the Standard players would feel shame then. Put together the percentage of Odd Paladins, Big Priests, Midrange Hunters and all the similar decks which provoke anger and frustration.
---
I play Midrange Hunter (and I've been playing that since the Witchwood days when I started Hearthstone). I know it's a cheap and non easily counterable deck, especially these days where everyone expects the expansion and the meta is stale.
---
But what should I do? I have no dust to craft a Rogue or Warlock deck, that I like. And I too prefer to wait until the rotation.

It's not the decks. The game itself has come to a dead end.

You are right. I was in death knight mode, so l literally couldn't draw anything! 
---
But My spectral cutlass was at 11 duration. I beat him down anyway… 
---
There was a boss in KoTFT that would restore to full hp if not killed in single round, so it could be too similiar to introduce boss like this.
---
Impossible, they just reprinted him in the last set. 😭
---
You got me excited..... that hurt.
---
Not quite, if you mean that frozen throne boss. A passive hero power would mean it HAD to be a single burst of 30 damage, not 30 in a turn. 
---
My cutlass was so powerful that I couldn't even not kill a minion to use the rampage. 
---
I usually add everyone after a fun match and I accept all adds, but usually those adds wish me cancer, a dead family or both. 
---
For the sake of making the format have a more *even* power level and interactive gameplay. 
---
So after crafting a deck you bring it directly to ladder ?
---
I too like casual for the higher variety but I didn't think twice about trying the one T1 deck I crafted in there. Seems to me that it is the purpose of casual anyway, the possibility of seeing whacky off meta decks is just a bonus.
---
You found an idiot on the internet, yay. Want a cookie?
---
It's literally impossible to make the strongest cards weaker and not lower the overall power level. Obviously no one wants wild to be weaker for the sake of being weaker, nerfing cards still makes wild weaker despite what they want.
---
Perfect.
---
While we're at it can I get a pack if I lose and two packs if I win, in any mode

Far sight Rag. Next turn Rag double ancestral spirit. Then Spellstone. Priest used lightbomb to clear but I guess they forgot about ancestral spirit.

Don't worry, we have 2 years of Mass Hysteria ahead of us.

PS is too slow for aggro. It murders midrange decks.

No, I play ladder too, but I don't really push.  I just play meme decks and typically hang around rank 10 to 15.

Let's assume you have a Golden copy of Baku. So when the next expansion hits, you will be awarded 3200 dust for owning the card and you can get 1600 dust from disenchanting. Am I right?
---
&gt; That is why people who want a higher power level don't like nerfing cards in wild.
---
Except Wild is incapable of keeping itself under control without nerfs, or heck, even buffs would be fine if it achieved the desired effect. 
---
Hearthstone does not have the level of interaction you need to maintain a format at the power level you and other people seem to want. Keeping the format internally balanced and playable is far, far more important than keeping it at some arbitrary level of power. And just to clarify, by balanced I do not mean weaker. An even power level and interactive gameplay is the goal here. 
---

Впрочем, ничего нового.
---
&gt;We still have to beg for more deck slots, tournament mode, and even basic statistics and balance changes.
---
It's also quite ridiculous given how basic some of these features is. When asked about achievements, Mike Donais answered something along the line of them adding them to the adventure and looking into it and learning as they go. But achievements are really nothing new and innovative that they'd have to slowly test the water about. Even the most basic games have them. In fact HS has some (hidden) achievements already! So then the designers pretending like it's such a hard task that requires much thought is just annoying.
---
Sounds perfectly balanced to me
---
&gt; So after crafting a deck you bring it directly to ladder ?
---
Yes? Why else would I craft it? The only way to learn how to play the deck is to bring it to ladder.
---
Yeah, I know the rope usually stops in place for a while, but this rope actually rewinded

The thing is, this one costs gold. In other tavern brawls you're free to experiment and even when the meta is "solved" you'll still run into people experimenting because there's nothing on the line. With Brawliseum most people will just play the best deck because they don't want to waste their entry fee.
---
no u
---
It's not even the best deck for winning. It's just horrible to play against and requires no skill so feels bad to lose to.

Nur#1653
---
If this was a normal tavern brawl you'd run into way more players who just want to have fun. In this mode there's so much value in netdecking (and so much lost value in not net decking) that the amount of people playing off-meta is practically zero.
---
No way are all the top tier decks in casual just practicing though.
---
EU for me too. Haven't received one in 5 months.
---
Big priest puts a damper on wild but it's fun aside from that deck!
---
So much for my Hakka Jungle Moonkin deck
---
More gold is obviously always nice. That said, I feel like they might not have realized brawliseum still gives 10 gold every 3 wins. The thing about arena rewards is that they've technically included the 10 gold for 3 wins into the arena run rewards already--i.e., the rewards already take into account how many games you win, right, and it doesn't have to be given out the same way as constructed (Arena is simply a mode that has a different reward structure from Brawl and Constructed, which I think makes sense because of how an arena run is set up).
---
Given that people ask for this somewhat often and assuming that they don't want to give more gold, they could lower arena rewards by 10 gold every 3 wins and give it to you as a reward every 3 wins instead.
---
They also said in some old interview that they have limited resources and main focus are expansions and improving already existing things. And we are getting some new stuff soon. They can't do everything the community askes for.
---
Bruh, you need to realize Wild is a clusterfuck they don't want to touch, it's a dead game mode in terms of updates, face it, it won't change.
---
I think Vanish is even worse. And it's not going to go away.
---
Yes pls i need this!
---
The problem is that when they make a Brawliseum with these very specific rules the meta becomes solved really quickly. In Arena people go for the best cards and archetypes, but they don't have control over what they get to choose from.
---
*Destruction 100*

Odd warrior isn't that bad against it I don't think. Two big game hunters help. I've not played it that much though maybe I got lucky

You can play around hysteria pretty easily most of the time unlike scream.
---
I do not get the mail anymore :-( last one was months ago... i allways liked it
---
Like on binary?
---
Netdecking is not a problem in a healthy meta. But a tavern brawl like this does not have a healthy meta. Solved meta + high reward structure for wins = 95% of players playing one of two top tier decks.
---
Yep, one of many QoL changes that should've been implemented years ago.
---
Clone priest takes skill though
---
They probably identify as a genderless tortilla chip.
---
It doesn't even feel like a word anymore
---
&gt; what's the argument other wise?
---
They make most of their money through standard, primarily through whales. Players, if not spending money, are content for whales. They don't want you to play arena over standard because then whales will have less players to play against. That is why there has been so little focus on arena most of the history. They have recently changed their tune on arena and rebalanced it properly, likely because they realised that streamers bring in a significant number of players through their viewership.

No worries :)

---
Well it's not really the right format to make concrete time plans. Let's just say it will be announced once it's ready.
---
They do not have limited resources,  they choose to spend a minimal amount of their revenue on developing the game, there is a huge difference.
---
^ Make a deck in wild with the cards you need to play to complete the quest and do a couple of casual games.
---
yes. craft what you want to play. eventually you'll get all the cards you need 
---
Is it worse than the mirror match?
---
By arguing against a gold increase, you come off like Blizzard.   
---
Your post read as "don't buff gold gain" rather than "increase gold gain for my specific situation".
---
Saying something like "Buff packs per week before you buff gold gain" would be a more clear and concise way to argue what I now grasp to be the intent of your post.

Well if tou play ranked this is normal. Agro is a really strong archetype right now. This is simply the meta right now. I know it can be frustrating to play vs certain decks(i hate playing vs big spell mage or otk priest) but that's simply the game.
---
*We’re always willing to explore new features like this!*
---
What you want to look at as a new player are cheap decks. Cheap decks are normally aggressive decks. Classes with cheap and aggressive decks are typically hunter (several archetypes) and warlock (zoo). There are other aggressive decks like secret mage or rush warrior right now but they are more expensive. Start with one deck and climb the ladder to accumulate rewards so you can roll with more expensive decks later on.

You're playing badly and playing a shitty deck if you're consistently dieing on turn 5 in the current meta

Do you want to play wild? Then you can craft jaina. If not, you can only use her for a few weeks. Keep the dust for a new legendary or several epics you might need.
---
FWIW, the post-nerf version was played in Wild. In parts of 2016, Secret Paladin was still very much played and one of the counters was Patron Warrior. I remember it distinctly because one of my Hearthstone friends is a consistent Legend player on both Wild and Standard, and I befriended him because at high ranks, I was playing Midrange Hunter (pre COTW nerf) and he was playing Patron Warrior. He was the few players I could so obviously see that outplayed, but still lost because I was using OP cards. I friended him to say "GG but you totally deserved the win"
---
**HE PLAYED US LIKE A GOD DAMN FIDDLE!**

When I say reflective I don't mean Jaina's t-shirt but the core gripes this community has with Team 5. These gripes are shared with people on r/competitivehearthstone, hearthpwn, twitter, youtube and all sorts of podcasts.

The engaged community wants HS to be more than a toilet distraction.

&gt;Also it's funny that you bring up German commuters because I'm living in Germany right now and play Hearthstone on the train everyday and **I always buy the expansion release packs and occasionally another 20 packs between expansions.**

Same... they’re still playing Fortnight like five year olds ands spend over $300 on costumes... I keep telling them to play a GOOD game like Hearthstone, Overwatch, and Apex. They to dumb to play Hearthstone, their suck at being a team in Overwatch, and they aim is trash in Apex... God dam those fortnight kids who think their good. YA YOUR GOOD WHEN YOUR ONLY ENEMYS ARE LITTLE KIDS! And that was an in entire rant I made a 7 in the morning about how I hate my friends and how Fortnight sucks D!ck. I hope the new expansion that comes out is good, or I might have to go back to playing Bo4, which I suck at.
---
Ah.. what a relief. That said, these people do exist who think Keleseth is well designed, but I guess they exist for nearly every card.
---
&gt;  How the hell do they always have him on turn two?
---
Yeah, it sucks and it's just dumb how a dice roll determines a considerable increase in win rate. 
---
I really hope the new expansion will bring less cards that are not fun to play against and at a similar power level like the last couple expansions (i.e. not high).
---
This is the whole reason ranked floors exist - so people play fun stuff at 15, 10, 5. Sucks when you're rank 6 and lose to a meme though

I don’t care much for post like this. The OP said very vague things. I mean look at the no duplicate legend rule, standard rotation (we all hated the idea of it but now it’s like a God send when you need a break from wild or standard). Arena is like not even remotely the same as it use to be.  Frequency of balance changes has gone up. Adventures were were scrapped for full sets.
---
Hearthstone will never be perfect guys, but at least we have a hearth development team doing something and moving forward in the process. It’s not always the direction we individually  or collectively want, but Team 5 is moving.

If you think about it we will get the 3rd plotter today, 4th on March 11 and the last one(probably with the whole expansion) on March 13. makes sense.
---
These are all great tips thank you everyone. I have one more question. What should I spend my gold on 
---
The artwork is still hand drawn. And still - If they were as carefree as you presume: Why did they out of over 1000 symbols to pick, only use some from the few where we can presume what they sounded like?
---
The game is bound to explode in popularity again with rotation. With the Year of the Mammoth sets finally gone, it'll be like getting four new sets at once. Add the changes to Arena and the solo player content on top of that as well as what the devs said in the AMA about adding more events and things to do in between expansions and I think the game will feel very different (in a good way) without adding entirely new game modes.
---
This was super helpful. Thanks so much
---
not from sacrificial pact tho
---
Yup I think waiting for rotation is a good idea. but dont miss the brawls and card packs they gonna give us during this 1 month + they said they will be releasing a card ahead of the expansion itself so have an eye on the news.
---
So many downvotes for a simple question xD
---
He had already attacked with the 3/1 before the clip started so I assumed he already tried to trade
---
If the guy who suggested that the one symbol is actually the chick (w) then I can ALMOST see the symbols making the phrase "Knowledge Is Power." If these sets involve villains using future knowledge, ulduar, archaeology and stuff, that'd be a super relevant message. I'm not confident that that's what it says, but I'm just basing this on your sound suggestions, not my personal knowledge of hieroglyphs. Either way, this is a great find.
---
!remindme 5 months
---
i got that reference
---
There’s already a delete deck button
---
I'd start by opening individual packs with gold until you get the guaranteed legendary within the firs ten packs of each set. Start with Witchwood, Boomsday, and Rumble since those three sets will remain in Standard after rotation next month.
---
Hey now that I think about it, they never said on what planet they were working. Might be Saturn years, or even worse Uranus years... 
---
How will that be fun if anything that mode will suck really badly 
---
Warlocks going around with sacrificial pacts in their decks 
---
And no one will play anything early on , it will just be hero powering mirroring one another with the player going 2nd at an advantage every time 
---
It's never been pay to win.
---
Good comment, only noticed genn and baku rotate out april 2019, instead of 2018
---
Pray they reduce the cost of classic packs to something realistic 
---
Share it!
---
&gt; Although if they removed gold rewards that end in 5
---
Yep, that's a reason I avoid this stuff.
---
Though they could just do a 15 gold per 3 wins kind of deal.  That'd completely get rid of the problem.
---
Is it worth the 400 dust?
---
A small indie team cant be bothered with stuff like this. 
---
You don't need Keleseth and Zilliax, Rexxar wins you that matchup alone
---
&gt; The main countries were done though. If you live somewhere remote sorry- can’t please everyone.
---
WHERE DOES IT SAY REMOTE?!?
---
He should for the guarantee legendary tho... 
---
added you EDEN#2597
---
At least in this meta, idk if anyone is gonna let you get to fatigue. It may be better to wait for rotation. Priest will try and otk you, and generally won’t let you value as you have to worry about them combo ing you before you can value (velen or huge taunt depending on deck, those are things you either have to kill, or weaken so they aren’t as scary (silence velen, reduce health total on taunt). Odd warrior is hard to out value with 4 armor a turn (on most turns). However, it can definitely be done. Everything else I can think of (hunter, rogue, paladin or at least the more popular decks for them) run out of cards quickly and it comes down to whether or not you lost by turn 7 or 8, or are close to losing. If not you are probably going to win. It’s just hard to value all the way to fatigue. My brother plays exclusively value while I play combo and this is what he says to me. 
---
You'll get respect for dropping a golden deathwing, dont disenchant
---
Yeah some people have said that they don't want to play Wild because the cost is too high to get started but if you crafted Wild Even Shaman or Wild Odd Paladin, you'd have a deck that was Tier 1 for about about one year straight. 
---
And even if there are new expansions, your decks are never completely invalidated. 
---
MtG: Arenas -&gt; way (it's a better game too btw).
---
"anti-consumer" get mad over a skin more buddy.
---
Yo anyone want 80 gold? BeefBroth #1337
---
"DisguisedToastHS" is annoying.
---
11 words in? Between somewhere and sorry. Are you being for real?
---
Yeah Reno decks can easily cost ~15k dust and I have seen lists that get close to 20k. The singleton limitation just makes it more tempting to throw more legendaries in.
---
That said, Reno decks are not really at the top of the meta right now and some of their non-Reno brothers (e.g. Mindblast Priest and M'Thunlock) are cheaper and doing better or just as well.
---

I have a fragile mentality for things outside of my control. You'd think that the opposite would be the case, but I find that it's easier to think productively when there's something you could have done about it. Realising it's just had bad luck and I should queue up again makes me tilt. I don't have a lot of time to continue to throw away on a chance to get slapped in the face.
---
So yea, I just don't feel like playing more than two games of any mode in hs
---
check out [hearthpwn.com](https://hearthpwn.com)

You will find a lot of decks there :)

Hope I helped

See....all the toxicity is coming from your side of the argument....I hope you the best I hope you can find happiness in the game.

Believe me...I do!

Did anyone ask about an auto squelch option or was it just ignored?
---
Also, his eyes are glowing blue. Why do you think that is so?

Why even Hero Power yourself?... So pathetic

Roses are red,

Violets are blue,

Copying from the OP,

Looks stupid of you.
---
I don't. Every time I run into a mill deck in Wild it makes me want to uninstall.
---
Why even leave this comment?... So pathetic

Like I said before you don’t need any of the legendaries other then Uther everything else is to help you draw and keep you alive... if you don’t have shirvallah you can still do the holy wraith otk with molten giants btw. 
---
Wish the animations in this game weren’t so insanely slow :(
---
I think mill rogue was one of the hardest deck in the HS history, the matchups were very polarized but winning the bad one was super hard and satisfying. I wish we had a rogue coldlight.
---
Got em too cant wait to get home and open dem
---
Unless they pour a bunch of money into the game, no they shouldn't. They'll probably be struggling for gold to buy enough packs to get the legendary from the last 3 expansions. And then as a new player they'll benefit heavily by getting a bunch of classic packs to.
---
same for me with the midgame disconnects. basically every game i disconnect, but reconnect luckily. sometimes i disconnect multiple times during one game. my internet is fine though, as streams e.g. dont pause or disconnect.
---
has to be in blizzards side. i was wondering why no threads were opened earlier tbh. was even thinking about opening one myself.
---
Thanks
---
Yeah, thats something I'm cool with. Mill rogue was not easy to play, and its a great example of using HS mechanics in interesting ways.
---
1. Play Cursed Castaway and trade it into the 13/8 (Now 13/7)
---
2. Hopefully draw Vilespine
---
3. Play Vilespine to kill the 13/12
---
4. Trade Witchwood Piper and Giggling into the 13/7 (Now 13/5)
---
5. Fungal an Annoy'trons to 5/5 to trade into the 13/5
---
6. Bonemare one of the other Annoy'trons
---
7. Trade away the Shark for board space
---
8. Alexstrasza
---
9. Go face with everything 
---
'Yes Paladin' was basically a meme deck containing nothing but 1-cost cards and a Skulking Geist.
---
Basically the entire concept was that you could play Skulking Geist on curve and therefore think 'yes' upon seeing the satisfying quantity of destroyed cards, thus ending the game shortly after.
---
^(just as long as you don't expect to win with it or anything it's fine)
---
Your Druid variant would *also* end the game in short order... although rather more in the Druid's favour I guess.
---
Rdu, Bunnyhoppor, Firebat, and Gaara. 
---
I was indeed thief rogue. But na Salina was used
---
Same here. Specially the Druid one. Boring as hell.
---
Agreed, tracking is so bad.
---
It's like someone took Graceful Charity from Yu-Gi-Oh and purposely made it as bad as possible in Hearthstone. (Graceful Charity lets you draw 3 cards and then discard ANY 2 cards from your hand, including any of the 3 cards you just drew)
---
I've played this game for a year and never even knew Prince Valanar existed.
---
What's the total damage? 55?
---
rip
---
I hope that we will see full exp on Monday then 
---
I’m with you. Only games I’ll insta concede just because it’s so pointless. Oh wow, I don’t have cards now. Weeeeeee, what fun. 
---
I play yugioh so i know what you mean
---
dude, you're basically flaunting and promoting fact u use lame decks. but hey, "other people do it too" so we're clean. but this isnt even real problem, hs is just a game and hs decks arent so serious stuff. problem is, if you have this attitude, i bet you feel fine doing average little bully b\*tch IN REAL LIFE too. 
---
so, what is right response? "yes, right! world is for bullies! yaaay! we need more of them!"...? no. it's "we need LESS of y'all. world must not be yours/like you". bye ;D
---
Oops, didn't look at that.
---
Also ragnaros the light lord card is a effy card, zillax is probably a better option if you have him
---
I think that's because people are so used to play in the most straight forward way; I think you wouldn't hate the deck so much if you played it by yourself, because you know, the deck is super challenging
---
In other words, you have it and we don't, sucks to be us.
---
You should consider working for blizzard, you've got a natural talent of writing long sentences that amount to nothing.
---
Wasn’t expecting that... somebody give this guy a silver
---
If they didnt play it yet i think it may be okay to play colossus.
---
Oh fuck that's bollocks then.
---
Zoolock. Cheap to craft, crazy fun, easy to rush them down. 
---
Anytime I got it in a loot crate and don’t play hearthstone so I figured I’d drop it here 
---
It is not a blind assumption to say, "Without Shadow Visions, Mind Blast and Divine Spirit-Inner Fire Combos will become unplayable," seeing as they always were before the release of Journey to Un'Goro.
---
Someone may go out and try to make the combo playable, sure, but without reasonable deck thinning or tutoring options (Neither of which Priest usually gets), mana cheating methods (something almost certainly to not to be replaced instantly at the very least), and a strong set of defensive tools (which is something typically reserved for the third set in a year for Priest in the last few years), it almost certainly will not.
---
Because no one really know what exactly is going to happen before it happens in any card game does not mean reasonable and educated predictions cannot be made. The "core" pieces for wall combos will remain, sure, but Priest will not be a class that can support it.

I wouldn't call Pirate Warrior bad. Many people still use a bunch of Reno/Greedy decks, and it stomps them. Yes there are other ones that perform better in more overall matchups, but it really just depends on when and where people play. 
---
I agree with Even Shaman, but just because that deck has an overall better spread doesn't mean Pirate Warrior is suddenly bad.
---
PC
---
How is it then when druid plays with himself, you're the one who gets \*\*\*\*ed?
---
If you have to buy them right now, Classic
---
If you can wait a month then just pre-order the new expansion, 60 packs for like $50 or something
---
And also not clicking on end turn when green
---
The link works fine for me, I don't know what you're doing.
---
You should see something like a cardback that has small hieroglyphs on the border of the **lower half**.

Why are in such a tizzy about this? I’m not trying to control anything lmao. I’m simply presenting an alternative view of something that ***may*** increase enjoyment for a certain subset of the playerbase. Something that many people aren’t even aware of whether or not it’s their preferred way to play because they simply have never tried it. Obviously people are free to either ignore me, or try out what I’m suggesting. It’s no different than suggesting someone try a different topping on a hotdog. I’m genuinely not sure why you’re making it much more dramatic than it is. 
---
If you’re so fragile that you need to resort to pretending I’m like, the fucking Hearthstone *gestapo* because of this, then I don’t know what to tell you. 
---
Take a chill pill maybe?
---
And how do you counter OTK decks on standard? And just saying, we saw OTK for 2 years. 
---
Spoiler, mill decks counters OTKs.
---
To each their own!  But I'll give OP the benefit of the doubt and act like he knows what he wants.
---
You're welcome.
---
It's definitely your phone, not hearthstone. I don't have any issues even if I play for 2h+. Of course it's shitty that it doesn't run properly/lag free on every phone, but that's on your hardware. 
---
I literally just got home from seeing this lmao, amazing comment 
---
And yet we find ourselves here, just after you made that snarky comment.
---
Is the drive you have Hearthstone on particularly full
---
You shouldn't buy anything right now, wait for the pre-order for the new expansion to be announced and spend the $50 on it. Your money will go way further there.
---
Why do you keep spamming your website?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/ayqqcm/hearthstone_wesg_2018_preview_match_odds/
---
That's fair. It might just be me, but seeing the same Legendaries so often, when so many more are available in Wild, makes the whole game feel pretty stale.
---
Grim rally is a card that exists. Huh.
---
I completely agree, every year same BS.
---
It is unbelievable how they are just printing and printing new expansions, without giving a f*** to add nes game modes, achievements, replays, tournament mode, etc...
---
They do not want to risk, to improove product they are selling, to redisign some of the UI.
---
They do only safe moves, with minimal improvements, and milk $$$ with expansions.
---
Any chance I could get the decklist?
---
4 mana less
---
Is he smoking weed?
---
same
---
i love you mr bigglesworth man
---
No one would remember it if not fact it was free in gold when Ungoro launched
---
Because I capitalized ‘your’ to add emphasize how on the fact that this is just your way of playing you know think that I’m treating you like the gestapo? This is the most whirlwind thread ever. 
---
Sure you say you think it’s no big deal but in your original comment your the one saying how you think it’s sad that players can’t think of they’re own deck and other judgmental comments towards these players. 
---
Holy shit
---
If it weren't for all competitive being standard I would solely play wild. Unfortunately, if you want to play in tournaments standard is the way to go.
---
I've just been hitting rank 5 in both modes for the last 8 months or so and then focusing on standard for tournaments. 
---
&gt; and the adventure card Barnes, who likely will get nerfed some time in the future.  
---
Oh my sweet summer child.
---
Did they answer anything?
---
imagine it was not a Leeroy, but a Hir'eek, so much better.
---
They all are top nuts. Bigpriest normaly the most reliable. Shaman vs Rogues, Renolocks vs Shamans.
---
Queue Luck is the only important thing. Good Luck!

(became legend in December with a mix of shaman, evenlock, and ~5 games of priest. 250 Wins in total from rank 20-&gt;Legend in a single month runtime)

i remember this day like it was yesterday
---
I just about always tracking on one. 
---
Wow, not a single common.
---
1. Better set design.
---
2. Better high mana cost cards at common and rare to support more diversity in budget archetypes.
---
3. Maybe a pauper mode.
---
Most of the world lists dates as day-month-year.

There's more here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering_formats#Other_casual_formats
---
MTGA has a a rotating special rules variant as well.
---
 
---
Your being deliberately obtuse, realistically, MTG has limitless game variants considering it doesn't rely on a client to run them, again, people can easily create house rules by the virtue of the game being physical. 
---
Wild is better period. 
---
Exactly it tells a perfect story as to why he’d want to join this league of villains. 
---
Back in his prime he would terrorise the meta but now he’s grown old, he’s become useless and is mocked as a result. This has made him bitter and so is reached out to by the newly emerging evil group with misplaced hope that he might gain power to once again rule the meta 
---
Honestly he’s basically guaranteed a broken legendary next expansion 
---
My math goes:
---
1 Legendary every 20 Packs avrg.
---
If you dont own all legendarys of that expansion its about 300-600 dust.
---
So basicly 1Legend=20Bucks
---
