EU trading 80g quests
---
---
---
You know, there are other parts in the world, like Europe, where we use . to indicate ks and , to indicate decimals. Luckily, not everything is America, my dude. Why do you US guys always have to be so assuming that your way is the only way? It's smug af.
---
And here we are going in circles. With little context we are unsure of whether or not playing the doomsayer when it was would be a good play. In such a circumstance this circumstance could be played around (unknowingly) while still playing correctly. Yes its pedantic but acurate.
---
Right you are. Mine was a dry utilitarian response to the very idea that maybe its better to use it there, when it never is
---
You beat me to the punch here, so I felt it was in order. :)
---
Well if it’s repeated then the death rattle for voodoo doll should trigger before the mechathun death rattle is triggered right? Why does the voodoo doll flag it to die and not kill it when it’s deathrattle is triggered?
---
How dare she defile the sacred act!
---
So glad Genn and Baku are gone. Just wish there was less RNG elements added.
---
Im so confused how hero levels work, You are level 60 with 115 win but my rogue is level 35 and has 110 wins?
---
ITS JOJO'S
---
Right, but Jojos is just a kripp reference.
---
I felt just as lost getting into standard this month.
---
The thing is that standard is more expensive than wild.  If you make a tier 1 wild deck now, it will probably still be viable in a year.
---
How about Duskfallen Aviana?
---
Hey we’re not allowed to get angry at any streamer besides toast. (Also give your post a flair)
---
Reposts have been ramping up like crazy on /r/hearthstone lately; are people really that bored with the expansion already?
---
The problem is that a lot of people want to do fun things with their control decks but die before drawing half their deck. Easy solution is if blizzard added more early game board clears like lighting storm and volcanic potion
---
Big priest relies on rezzing huge af minions to either smash face or combo off, he’s adding 3 useless 1 costs into that pool of rezzed minions. Also when the big board comes he has evolve counter whatever combo/shenanigan big priest is using.

Ofc I still won because ~~I'm~~ I watch the Hearthstone superstar

Klenner#11243 NA looking to trade, I can show quest but you go first
---
Title of this post is 11/10.
---
Well, the RNG factor is part of what makes this game so unique. I understand it may be frustrating, sometimes, but it's part of why hearthstone is, well, hearthstone. But I understand your point of view u.u
---
That is true so you need plan accordingly when piloting this deck.
---
It is weird enough, given that priest sees very little priest, it's a bit of a stretch to define the current meta made of only 2 classes :3
---
Gotcha
---
Does going into settings to locate game work? I'm currently on mobile but you can go into settings and each game has a directory linked to it. I believe you can attend it to locate the game there and choose where the folder of it is.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
all is good :)

Nomi, nomi, nomi, nomi
---
Also a mage one-trick here. Same variant in wild with flamewanker is also having a better time in RoS.
---
Had no problem getting to R5 with it.
---
Big Priest is based on cheating out huge minions way early and then resurrecting them a bunch of times. First and third card give opponent crappy minions that pollute their resurrect pool. 
---
Fourth card changes all minions into one of one less cost. Not as effective but still screws their gameplan if you high roll and they get a garbage minion that they don’t want to resurrect.
---
Really aggro hand with devolve to neutralize the minions it would create for his opponent
---
Yeah people keep thinkinghe is talking about the newer Hemet card
---
You win about 53.8% of the time, to be precise.
---
Man looking back that card was/is nuts. I bet it'd see play at 9 or maybe even 10 Mana.
---
Did you win?
---
You did fine until you superscripted the last ),.
---
Right so you're first statement was just full of shit, got it.  
---
Meta = stats, not your opinion.
---
naw it fucks up Big Priest's revive pool to give priest all those shitter minions
---
The base of the classic set heavily supports a Tempo Rogue deck, and it is a style Team 5 seems to like supporting.
---
You can probably skip to 1:25 to experience the sick rng
---
Wolftrain#2674 EU 80g quest. I show, you go first.

You're a moron.

there was no way for rogue to comeback on board, so doing nothing is the right play.

i like it

Yes that is true. I said as much before. Sorry for that misunderstanding
---
Mecha’thun warrior is pretty good

Sad reax only. I was at 26 health and he had 6 power on the board bro.

oh my god he ran in
---
[Here's all my standard legendaries](https://imgur.com/a/DaFBjdo). I'll probably save my dust for next expansion or rotation, tbh.
---
People are legit running this card.  In tournament decks.  So uh.
---
&gt; They can't fix any of that
---
I disagree. The game was fun at beta/release and for the next year. They could retain talent on the design team.
---
&gt; destroy the dust investment people made in those popular cards.
---
As with other nerfs the dust refund goes to 100% thus half your other points are also moot, just like this one.
---
&gt; Can I blame someone for going all in on one? 
---
You mean buy a bunch of packs? I'm pretty sure that's their goal. 
---
&gt; Would I be outraged and really fucking pissed if I had and then they nerfed it and I was sitting on a bunch of useless warrior shit and no where to pivot?
---
100% dust
---
&gt; I'd probably quit.
---
Just like a lot of long time players, imagine that.
---
"GLENN BECK" is what I hear...
---
I've been beating bomb warrior with heal druid. The deck is susceptible as hell to bad draws, though.

Well,  how do you give out decklists? Also its kinda a homebrew

Ha- Learn something new everyday... I'll add that to a list of gaming achievements I will never accomplish. I love playing fighting games with friends at a house party but anytime I go online I realize how poor I am with the game.

Sure looks like the witchy lackeys are generated half as much as the other ones. Any insight into that /u/hearthsim?

does the goblin lackey makes the minions who can attack hero unable to do so? or the rush is neglected?

Here you go my dude,  my homebrew control shaman
---
I mean maybe?
---
Ideally they would have both—obvious “build me” decks that everyone can see before the set is even released (like murloc shaman) and also weird experimental decks that take weeks to tune and perfect like miracle priest.
---
This is a formula that magic the gathering perfected a long time ago.  New and learning players really love the obvious “build me” decks like murlocs, whereas experienced players want decks that take weeks or even months to be figured out and show up in the meta.  Like...what’s the best use of Walking Fountain?  I don’t know, but everyone agrees it’s a strong card.

Bought it. Got Chameleos and Hagatha from my 5 WW packs. Very pleased. Would buy again.
---
Whizbang of course. How competitive?  don't expect to hit legend because there are a few bad decks in there but there are some really good ones too.
---
I think if you can get to a rank floor and are happy there go for it.
---
Bought it. Got Chameleos and Hagatha from my 5 WW packs. 10/10 would buy again.
---
I was running control hunter yesterday, works really well against these bomb warriors
---
Three out of every five turns after Dr. Boom is played, the hero power functionally might as well do nothing. The Rush aspect of the card allows it to meaningfully contribute to the game during that sixty percent of the time. It is not the problem so much as the two Warrior specific mechs that double as removal spells, Dyn-o-matic and Omega Devastator, getting turned into instand two-for-ones, and Omega Assembly producing an amount of value it usually takes Dr. Boom fifteen turns to produce.
---
Toning down those three cards will be a much more productive than really doing anything to Dr. Boom.
---
Additionally, Frost Lich Jaina had an extremely similar effect to Dr. Boom's, and for a control deck, Lifesteal is worth roughly as much as Rush, especially in Mage.
---
Rogue can just do way too much bullshit. Prep has to go.
---
Can't expect bullshit mechanics to ALWAYS work in your favor right? :)
---
&gt;4 4 4
---
*HEAVY ARTISTIC BREATHING*
---
Option B but you forgot to throw Miscreant in there somwhere.
---
Just cut all the summoning cards and run Fireball as your spell.  Problem solved?
---
It turns out decks exist outside of meta lists.

A reasonable nerf for Barnes, which was proposed many times, is to change him to summon 1 mana 1/1 "actor", which copies all effects of another minion in a deck. He still will be good with deathrattles, but priest won't be able to get full-size minions from him.
---
For the kings bane Rogue list, I find this list from Control to work much better. Owl is unneeded to bypass taunt, that's what your saps are for (which can also be prepped out). +2 goblin auto barber in Control's list, which is also good to turn magnetize with ziliax. And overall i've never really found the need for a vanish in such an aggressive deck. Mulligan for kings bane and start building it big to hit face. Bonus point: if you hate big priest, this deck tends to crush them. There is nothing they can do if you start getting kings bane big.

Not to mention that playing the lackey first would've also meant a bigger van cleef.

I like the current meta-raiding party and omega devastator need to be nerfed and I think soul of the forest should be hall of famed.

You're mistaken, it never did. If you have a screenshot or replay, link it.
---
Source: Burgle Rogue is my favourite deck.
---
Priest didnt get much other removal so it was necessary
---
Well you cant attack it or target it with spells and it has no health or attack so it prolly wont be affected
---
I hope you guys know this doesn't at all stop big priest lol. I've tried a bunch of iterations with shaman, mage and an anti big priest big priest and only the priest worked ok, but fighting fire with fire is not exactly a solution. You run out of transforms because their minions are only copies and not the original, so there's an endless train for them to get one to stick, not to mention you need way more mana than they spent to counter their plays
---
Maybe I was the one you was playing against? Lol
---
This is reaally funny.
---
It's [[Pristine Scenes]].
---
You get it from logging into the game on iOS.
---
You got really lucky if you actually shit on big priests trying to hex and devolve shit lol. Just one y'shaarj and you wont keep up anymore.
---
Rogue has the rare distinction right now of being both powerful and fun, a combo you usually don't see in top meta decks. Sure you can run the hyper efficient Myracle variant but even a Heistbaron Vendetta Lackey deck with the Waggle/Pirate package is still incredibly strong and the RNG makes every game different whole still being consistent enough.
---
Then create a new file
---
Faceless Lackey can summon Bluegill Warrior which can potentially deal 2 damage and still leave you with a 2/1.
---
Just from experience I can tell you that removing the minion from the deck when you essence/barnes already makes a huge difference in trying to stop them
---
Suggestions that counter everything they just did. Bringing back naturalise and doomguard. THEYVE BEEN GONE FOR 2 WEEKS. Can we live in peace?
---
Anyone on the team have something to say about mill rogue? I could provide a list upon request.
---
Wouldn't that be r/tinderforpriests?
---
/r/subsifellfor
---
Add that to the list of "cards that have never been complained about before but are suddenly broken and have to go".
---
This doesn't even come close to stopping priest. One y'shaarj and you can't keep up. They have more minions than you have transform effects and if you miss just one turn they'll get back on their feet in no time. You need to rush them down and have silence for statue
---
r/thirdsub

Thanks friendo

---
I think since they "fixed" or addressed timeout issues recently they've actually made it worse as I've had this happen a couple of times in recent weeks where as never before.
---
I guess the most impressive part was that the Al'akir came from a [[Muckmorpher]] as well, so lethal didn't even seem like a possibility from his hand at the start of the turn...

100%\*(1-((28!/30!)/(10!/12!)))
---
...or ~84.8% chance of happening. He should basically be expecting him to have the card.
---
*Disclaimer: I don’t know how to factor in mulliganning, but it would increase his chances even more.*
---
Mind you, priests also had benedictus.
---
It screws up their dependency on the resurrection mechanic. By giving their board low-cost creatures it increases the chances that they will resurrect them instead of things like Lich King.
---
I think it's more of a testament to the card pool being 3-4 times larger than it was in classic. If they were seeing the same amount of play now as back in the day, that means all of the expansions are way weaker than the classic set. 
---
Also I didn't know about that druid list, I guess I should have said it never saw widespread play after GvG.

"Infinite value" Warrior. Loses to Control Priest.

Follow them on Twitter. They post data for ranks 4-1 weekly. Yesterday, Mech Hunter was #1 in Europe with a 53% global winrate.

You can use the [Innkeeper](https://www.innkeeper.com/) from Hearthpwn to do the maths for you. You will see your collection stats and dust needed to complete it in your Hearthpwn profile.

You're playing warrior? Then it shouldn't be a problem because you have:
---
2 shield slams
---
2 brawls
---
2 executes
---
2 smolderon lancers
---
2 warpaths
---
Infinite dynomatics
---
Infinite omega devastator
---
Wow the engine sure was in your favor I hit 6 as my highest ever
---
Nomi is what I believe mecha'thun should have been. A very powerful finisher that can be interacted with.
---
Everyone is running this deck but hey welcome to hearth stone the net deck capital of tcg
---
Whenever I get angry at the game, I think about how tilting last year was and I instantly calm down.
---
This aggro meta without zilliax? No, thanks
---
Yeah, I somehow got it into my head that it was Frozen Throne... good thing to know, cause I'd rather pay the 1 more mana for the stats over Owl
---
at least you have some dust from the 2 legendaries lol
---
Wtf that's not the right decklist.

Is this actually working for anyone? It didn't even work for me after turning on pc aftet night
---
Congratulations!
---
thx, now the download worked &lt;3. Don\`t scare me like that again LUL
---
Nice net deck your way up there gg
---
Yeah, but control Priest isn’t that popular, and it gets obliterated by anything else, since we lost Scream to get back in the game, so yeah...
---
Heck, even Silence Priest became very good in Wild
---
yeah i used the dust to build my 5th priest deck, deathrattle.
---
yes because its OPs turn. all they have to do is play the Mechathun.
---
He mean it
---
Unfortunately no but he did eternal servitude out a few 1 drops
---
I'd not processed that it'd have rush, my bad
---
Lmao I swear people in the comments acting like we’re in r/competitivehearthstone
---
Tempo rogue is not even the best deck winrate-wise at the moment.
---
are you sure it will contain cards though? they have already released a lot of cards in the rise of shadows packs... will they go an extra mile and make more?
---
What's a good deck I can use for Mage, priest or druid as those are my three favorite classes?
---
Same, had to uninstall manually every game to be able to reinstall [Battle.net](https://Battle.net), and then every games...
---
I swear I didn't see that on front page when I was posting this. Still, the fix is not working for me. 
---
Thanks for your effort though!
---
You did it
---
That reminds me of a friend of mine who used to put Malygos in every single deck, even without any burn spells or combos.
---
When I asked him why burn a turn dropping Maly without any offensive spells in every deck, he just confidently replied, *"Oh man it baits out their hard removal or eats their resources to remove it every time!"*
---
You should take even more pride because they adjusted Rogue down about a week ago so it’s not even OP overall anymore.
---
I’m a returning player I have not played in a good while, what deck should I invest the tons of dust I have so I can win some games?
---
Kabal chemist causing disconnects on mobile
---
yes
---
no man could resist such temptations
---
That guy has a deck better than mine. Let’s complain in the Reddit!
---
Deal with it
---
Todays meta is like playing rock paper scissors...
---
I saw a show where they raid a Drugdealer's warehouse and one of the guys yells "Leeroy..." while charging in [only source I could find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhnxqMGtrHg)
---
So...your cheat cheated some cheap chumps that chortled at your cheekiness?...dear god, I’m sorry.
---
Oh, thanks. Did not notice that
---
&gt;Also you saying that tempo rogue is the best deck in the history of hearthstone is crazy at least to me to hear. I’ve been playing since around GvG and i feel decks like Highlander Priest, Patron Warrior, Midrange/Overload Shaman, and Secret Paladin, just to name a few, have been insane decks that dominated their metas.
---
While rogue does not share the same winrate these decs had, those decks *did* have recognizable counters from decks and cards that would perform over them. Rogue in it's current state does not share this trait. Rogue Has a positive winrate over every single archetype and custom deck in the entire game, only with the exception of control warrior.*That* is what is unheard of. We've never had this level of uncounterability in hearthstone, *ever*.
---
I used to play Evolve/jade Shaman with two hex and two devolve and I would never win against Big Priest. Spoiling the rez pool just doesn't work.
---
In time we’ll get a subreddit for every HS class.
---
Nail is 10/10 dietitian
---
How do you draw with that list ?
---
That’s why I tech harisson
---
Overall winrate means hardly nothing. 
---
Instead, look at the stats we have from legend ranked players and from the masters qualifiers tournaments. 
---
*This* is where the story is told, and that's why this subreddit is such utter horseshit when it comes to talking about this kind of stuff. Not many people here actually play this game on a competitive level.
---
I have no idea if there was any other , more efficient day to do it, but I literally opened 10 Google Translate tabs on my browser, a list with Rise of Shadows cards and Notepad. And then start translating each name and text, copy paste through each tab and then to Notepad. 
---
It tool about 6 hours , with some bathroom breaks and whatnot, to do the translations.
---
Then I downloaded the card arts from the Hearthstone website, I had to click on the art (if I downloaded directly it would give me the 180x200 or whatever art, that looks bad in a card, wait to load (I have decent internet so that didn't take too long) , and then download the medium sized pic out of the 3 available. Took me about 40 mins.
---
Then I went and used the same website that I use to make custom cards in order to make every Rise of Shadows card from scratch , but with different text. Was extra careful to not make any mistakes and even redone cards in which I missed the Type (which is not translated),  that took almost 4 hours. :)
---
I hate a lot of American movies that do it too. At least the superhero ones don’t purport to be based on actual American history.  
---
And ip does the double whammy of going so far past the line of reason in its jingoism while having no actual history to base it off (while using a real guy’s name as its selling point) very few Hollywood action movies even approach that level of movie sin. 
---
Not to say Hollywood isn’t full of stupid shit. See: replacing the ancient one in dr.strange with a white lady instead of a lore accurate Tibetan, out of fear of scaring the Chinese censorship board since itd draw attention to the fact that China invaded Tibet, drove the Dalai Lama out, and is currently committing a large number of human right abuses to stamp out Tibet’s culture and sovereignty. See, even Hollywood is just as bad as Chinese cinema when it comes appeasing china’s bullshit ego and censorship board.
---
He lost
---
Crazy effort. Wish i could do more than a thumbs up. Ty for all the info
---
YES!
---
I bet you waited longer than 1 minute (j/k)
---
5th priest deck
---
What a mad lad
---
Hahaha, it's not like N is  anywhere near L haha
---
&gt; Because most people want the game to unfold slowly and they want to get to 10 mana..
---
I don’t. I enjoy quick games and I don’t think I’m in a minority. I like the challenge of truncating my games.
---
Sort of like a puzzle.
---
&gt; People just hate when a bunch of small minions fill the board and go face..
---
So minions are supposed to sit around doing nothing? Sorry I like actually playing cards.
---
I just noticed that Roger is in the list. I have a Hearthstone player to watch now. He may be banned in other competitive Hearthstone games, but I'm sure he'll dominate the World Cyber Games.
---
what
---
Coin + Disguised Toast
---
“I’m missing Deathstalker already” this hurt me on so many levels
---
Did you go second every game? Because EVIL Miscreants are great on the coin and even better for comboing with Rager next turn but you have only one meh 3 drop to play on turn 3 going first. Anyway, good job.
---
Undatakah Paladin is also infinite value.
---
Your mission, u/ETH4NHVNT, should you choose to accept it, is to pull off Jepetto Hunter OTK.
---
well it was either that vs faceroll druid or do-nothing warrior. its a fun deck, i like it.
---
I must be remembering the video wrong, cause I don't remember him saying Rogue is in an ok spot, I remember him saying Rogue is _beatable_.
---
Besides, the whole point of that video was to say how you can build your deck to beat rogue. If you're a competent deckbuilder, you aren't going to consider turn 2 8/8 Van Cleef. That's a high roll you probably can't beat, and therefore isn't worth planning for when you can plan for games you have a chance at winning.
---
And also...
---
&gt;No other deck has been this bad in the history of hearthstone.
---
I'm not gonna say Tempo Rogues isn't insane, but during Shamanstone one of Midrange Shaman's worst matchups was the mirror at 50%. There has been worse.
---
Warrior (+ Elysiana) is a little bit annoying and Druid can refill his deck way too easily. But other than that I have been enjoying it.
---
Where does it say Aussies are ineligible for it?
---
Meh except the fact that when you see a Dr Boom turn 7 you lose unless you are playing rogue 🤓
---
Infinite value leads to otks but currently no one of them is decent enough end tempo rogue requires lots of counters if you hope to survive while being always ahead on board.
---
Not perfect leathal not unlucky enough
---
I would first like to ask which decks you are playing, secondly have you taken a look at silence priest? (Not trying to imply that it is prevalent ) silence priest seems to have the tools to kill rogue pretty quickly, from experience if you can curve out as silence priest ( not perfectly, just as an example: turn 3 arcane watcher into turn 4 unsleeping soul, sometimes just getting convincing infiltrator is good enough)
---
I know its not the best deck but i wanted to know if you have played it against rogue?
---
Try yes paladin in that case
---
You can translate via Google sheets which probably would've saved you some time at the beginning
---
if you plan on not spending too much, make a Zoolock. The legendarys are replaceable, and chances are you already have most of the cards. As secondary, make a budget version of token druid and if you have the base for it, make a control warrior (which will eat a crapload of dust if you don't have the base cards and Dr. Boom, mad genius + archivar). Then you have 3 Decks which you can play in all ranks, and you'll have a bit of flexibility to react to meta changes.
---
Np. You are a gaming beast. Fuk friends, get legend
---
I love playing Mill Rogue against them
---
The composition is finally perfect.
---
From a competitive point of view I agree but I find it impossible to take Hearthstone seriously. I like gearing up decks to just beat one particular deck I hate. I understand that isn't a good strategy but Hearthstone is a purely casual game in my opinion.
---
Oh wow! Um... Can I downvote a subreddit? Hahaha
---
The only trinity I believe in is..
---
UNITY 
---
PRECISION
---
PERFECTION!!

---
Just win by turn 6 then?
---
That’s Barry, and it’s an amazing show.
---
who hurt you, he just asked why :(
---
I know what you mean, but maly is a complete different story imo
---
You can still play something alongside her, so you don‘t lose too mich tempo. With maly you commit your whole turn for that play, which can and will cost you the game if you can‘t get any profit out of it.
---
It‘s not a card you just put in your deck to throw out there, with celestia you have to evaluate every single turn and have to know what your opponent is most likely to do. She is terrible against tempo/ zoo decks, decent against controll and great against other value-oriented decks and if you ask me, having a card thats not suitable for every deck but good in the one where she does fit ( looking at you, [[Zilliax]] ) is good card design.
---
To be fair, she still got dropped for [[Archmage Vargoth]], simply because he gives more imminent impact combined with [[Thoughtsteal]] and [[Entomb]]
---
I love it when they evolve Miscreant. This separates the good ones from the bad ones. Miscreant has five health and it is sturdy enough to get some few bounces? Your opponent decides to trade or remove it, you just got value from that. Evolving it yourself denies you of getting bounces.

1 .Which deck should I use? 
---
2. Idk if its good or not but I want to try a deck that can spam a lot of cheap and small creatures instead of a few expensive ones. 
---
I hope it makes sense.
---
I don't think rise of shadows is really better than rastakhan's rumble, it just doesn't have to compete with the broken year of the mammoth cards. If the 2 expansions were reveresed most of the rise of shadows cards would have seemed like trash too.
---
...did you see ~~Rambo~~ ~~any 80s action movie~~ every hollywood movie? 😝 I mean they literally change things that are public record in history pieces.
---
You can make some unique plays with those two. They’re by no means awful. They just, you know, have absolutely no place in the meta and it’s probably good that you dusted them.
---
(but I have yet to find a single player who’ll willingly keep an enemy cho on the board for more than five turns)
---
Is anyone surprised we have a more fun meta now that Death Knights and cards from Kobolds have gone?
---
It's mainly a hand filler to get off a good whispering woods while you are still able to use t3 to play something for tempo, or to give you drops if your hand is unfavourable/ opponent has 1-2dmg aoes so you have something that sticks.
---
Actually, that would make sense. Spell stone and Servitude count Different minions. So this would that combo, while too expensive to really help, would be cool.
---
Yeah, if they had shown this for turn 1-4 and say for turn 8+, the faceless might have been better for 1-4, and the etheral for 8+, because at this point you can get huge spells.
---
Reminds me of some analysis I read in a similar thread a long time ago, about animal companion;
---
On turn 3, Misha is the highest winrate animal companion you can get. Huffer only gets a better winrate later in the game.
---
Mass horror is also nice. Saw it on enemy in Dog dog's streams.
---
Spend more.
---
very nice
---
He would complain about how it was an instant loss and then miss lethal
---
yeah i think me and my opponent could agree that we both want the cho gone from the board.
---
Isn't "being integral to many decks" one of the main reasons to HOF cards? Just like Malygos, Leeroy needs to go to make room for new decks.
---
I assume the only reason why both aren't gone yet is that Blizzard hates giving out free dust.
---
I think it's in part because sometimes they shadowstep miscreant... And sometimes, 'evolve' actually downgrades the minion. It'll give it more attack, but will almost always give it less health. Miscreant is tough to kill because it has 4 health. But 4 mana minions are often 3-3, 3-4, sometimes even worse than that when they have big battlecries. 
---
And sure, a 4-3 is better than a 1-5, but it's easier to kill with spells on turn 3-4.
---
So I'd say the poor winrate is a combination of people shadowstepping the miscreant, so maybe not using it early on, and of the lowrolls they can get.
---
The fact that this post is deleted is rather fitting honestly
---
Actually, that would make sense. Spell stone and Servitude count Different minions. So fill the board with one token, but devolve them into many different minions.
---
I wanna join but Druid is my favourite class
---
From what I know, Chalk and CaraCute are well-known Hearthstone pros in the Philippines. They even made an appearance in the Hearthstone Championship Tour in the past. Glad to see them in the World Cyber Games.

---
Right now I am laddering with a bunch of decks. Unfortunately the only ones I can gain ranks with are the ones that are not too fun to play.
---
Fun decks I've played: Handlock, Pogo Rogue, Big Warrior, Control Shaman (with Spirit of the Frog), Dragon Paladin, a custom Wallet Paladin of sorts, and a custom Mech Control Paladin.
---
Laddering decks: Control Warrior, Mecha'thun Warrior, Token Druid
---
I admit I have not messed around with Silence Priest too much but looking at HSReplay data it's a 54% against Tempo Rogue.
---
From what I've played of old Silence Priest, it seems like you either highroll or lowroll with not much in between. The current silence priest is less of a miracle deck, but it still has to curve out well to stand a chance.
---
Silence Priest isn't really at a good power level right now. The can't attack minions are more expensive and less cost effecient than the old silence priest, and even though we got some good tools with Unsleeping Soul,  Dalaran Librarian and Faceless Rager, it just isn't enough to make the archetype good.
---
Maybe Silence priest will be viable after nerfs (if nerfs happen that is) but right now it isn't exactly a super viable ladder deck.
---
sadly just a gold rare and golds
---
just give it rush :D

Token druid then. Since you get one of the legendaries in the deck for free by logging in, it will only cost you 4360 dust or even less if you have some of the cards to begin with.

# Find this deck on https://hsreplay.net/decks/nMO4cjoONeRGT8LKKSWkA/
---
Is this a bug? Because if I wanted to ‘Replace’ a card I wouldn’t do it with the same card.
---
So what I'm getting is that you don't want to join.
---
Last night I went from rank 6 to rank 10 conceding against all but priest with a mage deck I made. I only found three priest but I crushed their souls. Worth.
---
Well as someone who has only reached 9 wins, nice job :D
---
I went and launched the hearthstone exe directly without opening the launcher first. This seemingly fixed the problem for me
---
I don't really get how you'd do it tho. Thaur tick?
---
I’m f2p player and I don’t own any of these legendaries so it was very cool choice.
---
Picked Kalecgos btw
---
Oh, well i didn't know it want too good at laddering, i have been doing pretty well with a mix of token druid and silence priest (granted im still only at rank 10) it might be the unusual cycle engine i use (might not be too unusual, i just cut wild pyro and token vendor in favor of dead ringer and loot hoarder, dead ringer has a good range of things it can pull and loot hoarder is draw with a small pile of stats) Thank you for looking at the deck though, also i didn't know mecha'thun decks could actually do good on ladder, i thought they would be dead because of the all the combo hate in this expansion.
---
I think ill try a mecha'thun deck if they aren't doing as bad as i thought they might.
---
Yeah, I consider druid a fun class to play.
---
Try Veressa Hunter with Malygos, Alextrasa and Jepetto. First of all it’s a fun deck to play, because that’s what Hearthstone is supposed to be, “fun”; second of all, if you manage to draw a 1 mana malygos, you can do alot of dmg at once with twinspells and arcane shot. The deck also has plenty of removal. Alextrasa his face -&gt; if he has more than 30 hp left (with armor) -&gt; try again next game
---
Ez
---
What do you expect lmao. It’s either deck A beats deck B but losses to deck C. Or deck X beats every fucking deck in the game.
---
Always remember to coin Kalecgos for tempo
---
You don't really want to tech in generally bad cards just for one match up though, no matter how much you hate that particular deck. When Murlocs are overpowered people will play Hungry Crab, but that doesn't mean everyone is fine with Murlocs being Tier 0
---
Golden Pilfer Pog
---
Thank you!
---
You never dust classic legendaries.
---
Because people can call it whatever they want but I still think it's dumb and nothing will change my mind.
---
I only play on iphone, so sadly the Innkeeper won‘t help me. But a useful tool indeed!
---
On the matter of f2p, I am p4f and fine with it. ;-)
---
It depends on you're facing. If there are a ton of Warriors where you are on ladder  then Mecha'thun Warrior is a good idea.
---
Blindly queueing a deck isn't the best way to go. Try to feel out what decks you are facing as you play. Keep in mind though that something like queueing into 3 mech paladins in a row doesn't mean everyone is running mech paladin.  It could just be a coincidence.
---
I have played against so many decks like this,  its hilarious. Game becomes rng fiesta.
---
At least you are guaranteed to not open them again. (in case you don’t dust them or already have all classic legendaries)
---
I would actually keep nat pagle
---
I think people are really annoyed but it because it seems that he enables a lot of aggro decks by giving them a really good burst damage finisher. That'd be fine but as the guy above me mentioned it's the extreme high damage combos that are annoying. I don't hate nor love Leeroy IDC what happens to the card I'm.just wondering.if it's going to get nerfed because not recent amount of complaints
---
Yes, they're absolutely awful. Don't sugarcoat it.
---
Yeap meta is good except blizzard trolled us with Elysiana...)
---
That's how the no-duplicate rule works.
---
its\*
---
I don't think that will happen. Madame Lazul was already kind of a stretch, so the "villains of Hearthstone" pool might be depleted already.
---
And really they shouldn't add too many characters to their story, five villains is more than enough.
---
What's a reign deck
---
The thing with devolve is that all mana brackets are not equal.
---
8 mana is the strongest. 10 mana is usually 8/8 giants. 9 mana can be a hit or miss.
---
But 7 mana? That's just full of bad stuff. Devolving a Ragnaros or LK can be huge.
---

I mostly run into slow combo decks (rogue, priest, occasional mage or warlock) or aggro decks such as tempo rogue or token druid. The aggro decks are easy enough (mass hysteria is one hell of a drug) and the combo decks i play against die pretty quick, its been a few days since i have queued into a warrior (first few days it was pretty much exclusively warriors), so what would you recommend i try?
---
Hey, they're good Legendaries.
---
Not every deck has been tried yet.  But we don't need to argue as a point of objective fact that Rogue is overpowered, opinions will do just fine.

you can't not win against bomb or control if you play your cards right, as in make him squander his resources
---
pretty much
---
The effect is awesome
---
Renhun#2133 80g quest trade, Ill show, but u go first.
---
At least it wasn't Millhouse
---
Thanks for the answer, will probably disenchant then.
---
Why don't you just play spell hunter in wild if you like it?
---
IIRC that's what happened with Yogg.
---
Raiding Party is without a doubt the strongest 3-mana spell Rogue has ever gotten.  3-mana is important, because it's the highest mana cost that is still 0 when prepped out.  0-mana spells are A LOT more powerful than 1-mana spells, as anyone who's run into Prep-Party-Miscreant on 3 can attest.  Or Prep-Party-Backstab-8/8 Edwin, add in the coin for a 10/10.
---
Prep is pretty design-limiting because its existence means they can't make the mistake of printing good 3-mana spells for Rogue, or it turns into what it is now.
---
People with chronic diseases need to know they are extremely important!
---
If there are no warriors around the best deck would probably be tempo rogue. I don't think Tempo Rogue has an unfavorable matchup outside of Warrior.
---
For techs, run fan if you want to counter token druid specifically. No need to run togg unless warrior is around. Hench Clan Thug probably isn't the worst idea either. Nomi isn't really that good so it probably isn't worth running.
---
i'd put a 2 hagatha's scheme's and 2 omega minds.
---
that's 2 reno jacksons in the late game
---
Hey Circle of Healing is good...
---
I've beaten on curve boom with handlock before, same with mech hunter; it's def doable.
---
Yeap thats more possible than what I am suggesting, indeed. But... My question is, can these 5 villains really have a chance on taking Dalaran? I mean they do have bombs, but not mana bombs!
---
Oh, i don't run rogue currently, i have only run token druid and silence priest so far, thank you for the advice though.
---
Tempo Storm is analyzed by pros, and the results are a bit skewed in that sense. Players at lower ranks can get better results with easier decks when compared to legend rank players.
---
VS on the other hand gives three tier lists all based on statistics and sorted by rank. If you take a look at the legend tierlist on VS, you'll notice that mech paladin is tier 2, closer to what Tempo said about it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You probably should look at VS more than TS. Pure statistics give more accurate results, and sorting by rank ensures that you can get a more accurate picture of what's happening on your skill level.
---

---
Reign of shadows, also I just don’t really like wild
---
Ancient watcher look like he is on pogo stick
---
A budget Rogue deck isn't even that bad. Today Zalae and Firebat were trying to take a tempo rogue deck with no legendaries to Legend ( I saw them get to 3 but idk how it ended).
---
If you don't want to run Rogue though, that's fine. Token Druid is probably your best bet, it should get you to at least Rank 5 as long as you play decently. I actually hit legend this season with token druid (but it was a few days after the expansion when people didn't really know how to counter it).
---
Anyways, I'm off to sleep. Best of luck on the ladder!
---
Sylvanas was not HoF based on lack of popularity of the character. Gameplay needs is the first consideration obviously - her deathrattle is just too powerful. Do you like \[Spider Bomb\] beaing cheated out over and over by Hunter destroying your board? Imagine even more swingy effect.
---
Popularity of the character is by far much more secondary consideration
---
 Trading 80G quest EU GrandWazoo#2159 I'll show, you go first
---
I hear it's good in nomi rogue though.
---
Probably try and explain my point without sounding harsh. 
---
I don't hate the deck as much as the people i seem to play against. 
---
I play a control shaman, and they just flood the board forgetting that shaman has the cheapest board clear in the game, but lucky for them i dont have it in m hand. 
---
They dump everything in a perfect curve but it doesn't matter about mana, because rogue has both vendetta's to clear any sort of defence you put up in their first ten cards. 
---
i prefer control because it feels cards have a time and place, a way to optimally use them, but against aggro it feels like that dont matter, dump what you can when you can and pray they dont have an answer ...... and hearthstone philsophy of one less cards than other card games in your opening hand usually means you don't. 
---
However, i understand that the match up of aggro vs control is a linear one and so i dont judge all aggro on it, i just hate how much it just high rolls
---
I would say make a budget midrange hunter. Hunter is usually really cheep and preforms really well on ladder.
---
Where is milhouse btw
---
That. Hagatha generates 'unlimited' value too, but the rush of the mechs is just too good in a meta were boardcontrol is important. I think the rush has to  go.
---
I currently do run token druid, i did know that budget rogue wax not that bad i just couldn't finish it, but i think ill finish crafting it and give it a go, thank you for such amazing advice and thabk you for being quick about responding, i hope you sleep well, have a nice night :)
---
You don't tech your deck against fringe decks you play once a week.
---
The pilot could have reached #7 without it too.
---
Works every time
---
Went to hsreplay, sorted decks by win-rate, saw two pages of zoolock decks... Yep, warrior is the problem.
---
Pretty sweet.  I’d go Kel, only because you don’t have an 8 drop.  Or maybe BK, because removal on a body is great tempo.  I think Jarraxxus is too slow tbh.  I’m certainly no expert tho
---
Tempo rogue is all the jazz at the moment.  I’m having a lot of fun with bomb hunter, which I think is actually a T1 deck
---
You may as well run elek
---
!remind me 5 hours
---
Which Boom? I think the hero boom is a bit busted in control with the mech rush and delivery drone but I don't think Blast master is particularly overpowered.
---
Dr. Hero I win the game has higher winrate during mulligan than one drops and him being in standard means that only super fast and otk decks can compete.
---
It’s about sending a message
---
Who the hell was talking to you
---
It has been mentioned in another threat, but anyway, here's the solution:
---
Destroy a minion for 6 mana. Oh and you get a bonus effect.
---
I understand you either a rank 20 player or a bomb warrior player (in that case you will get your dust refund dont cry)
---
But you can actually plan on RNG, it will never be 100% precise but if we look at Ragnaros as a RNG example, you know he hit 1 random target, if enemy has 2 minions it means 33% chance to lethal.
---
You know you can act on this RNG by killing 1 of his minions for 50% chance of lethal.
---
You know that if you clear his board you will get 100% lethal.
---
With bombs you don't know what to do, you know you have bombs in your deck, you don't know the order, even if you knew the order what you gonna do? you can't reshuffle your deck or something, you can't really peek into it, you are at the mercy of the RNG gods.
---
If this game was truly 100% RNG game (which with the latest expansions is not) then "pro" players would not exist since each game is just a coin flip, (there is no pro player for "war" card game).
---
  
---
Because you are a bomb warrior I will give you an example of good RNG you can understand.
---
Dyn-o-matic: you know it deals 5 random damage, but you see if the enemy has a minion with 2 health and another one with 3 health you know for sure the outcome so is it RNG?
---
You know that if the enemy has 5/1 (Magma rusher or smth) and a 8/8 giant for example that there is a very good chance 1-(0.5)\^5 = 96.875% that the magma rusher would die.
---
This is a good RNG since you can plan on it.
---
It might be now, but when Ultimate Infestation and Spreading Plauge were a thing, it wasn't fun to play against.
---
Tempo rogue, myracle rogue, burgle rogue?
---
I would not craft hunter cards just yet
---
&gt;this rng help me. Is good.
---
&gt;this rng lost me a game. Is bad.
---
I keep forgetting that the strongest force on this sub is personal bias.
---
That cross FX is totally worth it.
---
A night's rest didn't work for me either. 
---
But then I just closed JUST the application for two minutes and restarted and now it works.
---
ok you are a lost cause, say hello to rank 25 players for me
---
This game needs a "Try-mode", where you have access to all the cards, but can't play ranked/do quests/earn gold with the decks you build there.
---
Damn so edgy. Be careful to not carve into your keyboard lmao.
---
To battle! To battle! To battle! To battle!
---
*HEAVY MISTA BREATHING*
---
What mirror match is not decided by who draws the best card of the matchup first?
---
Single bombs are fine this is why I suggest to limit it to get a single bomb per turn.
---
Sometimes warriors can shuffle around 6 bombs in 1 turn (weapon attack + elekk + 2 goblin bombers), and near the end game this is almost a guaranteed instant lethal which feels rather bad, even if you have elyissa in hand u wont have a turn to act cause u will instantly draw all and die
---
The Hero cards are still problematic, IMO (Boom is too much value and Zul’jin swings games on the spot) and aggro seems a little too powerful but otherwise I like where things are headed.
---
Yes. Let's just nerf up to 5 cards. Because of a single strong, not dominating by any means, deck.
---
If Blizzard would take these posts into account we would have nothing but 1 mana 1/1, 2 mana 2/2....you get the idea.
---
I like Ike. He is powerful.
---
Many hearthstone fans have Stockholm syndrome. They think the current game is fine as is, and the cost is worth it, plus anyone who disagrees is wrong and needs to get on board or leave.
---
This is coming from someone who's been playing consistently since naxx so I've been here for a while.
---
Same here.
---
If you're a player who invests in the game, then of course, get every card possible..
---
If not, you should make do with what you have until the meta settles..
---
I'm doing okay with a zoolock from collection, with no crafting..
---
Also playing Quest Hunter, in Wild.
---
Murloc shaman. You flood the board over and over so fast they use up all your removal, then you easily bloodlust kill them. Works even without legendaries.
---

Man... Dr. Boom is starting to become pretty insane. Once I notice they haven’t used their omega mech discover card and they’ve eliminated every threat I bring to the table I know it’s GG. Any minion they have at that point becomes Walk The Plank and they’ll at least discover a free one every four turns off hero power. Really the only frustration so far
---
The cards that keep the enchantments are specified in the card text: [[Immortal Prelate]], [[Kingsbane]].

1/1/3 | Always keeps enchantments. Deathrattle: Shuffle this into your deck.  
---
nah sounds more like he doesnt disenchant anything except if he has more then 2(1 for legendaries) copies of it.  
---
like i for excample also bought the preorder bundle and can play a decent amount of the decks but i certainly miss some key cards for some decks.  
---
but i never disenchant any card, except its double or golden(except legendaries there i disenchant only non-golden versions if i have the golden one) or they are giving 100% dust.
---
I got kinda lucky with some legendaries and some not but I think you're right, it doesn't affect it that much, it's more about smart dusting and finding the right decks to craft...
---
Raiding Party and Prep both existed before rotation, and rogue wasn't the top class then. The issue seems more to be lackeys and them having gotten better things to pull with their party.
---
I don't think anyone is disputing the fact you can make decks with those resources. What feels shitty is for that money you don't get even close to accessing full content of the game. For 80€ you could buy two brand new AAA games with full access to content. I understand this just comes as part of the tcg genre but it just feels bad. It isn't sustainable for similar players to me who play very casually maybe just 3 or 4 games a week.
---
Yeah you can if warrior doesn’t draw eternium rover, warpath, shield slam, shield block, the 5/5 rush which can be drawn by town crier, dynomatic, brawl, super collider, Darius.
---
I emphasise the thing but it’s quite a lot of cards to control before turn 7
---
But of course it’s possible to win before and if it wasn’t the game would be broken by now 😄
---
There is no point, they wont change the cost mechanics anytime soon.
---
Just play with what you get as I have been doing past few years.
---
Well for 150 packs a actually missing like 7 legends
---
Congrats man
---
it is an instant heal in stats for a minion. and if you think about it as the avg stats of the next mana up, it should be the same or slightly better. It does get a bit risky I think after 5 mana and higher. There are some wacky cards out there.
---
Oh, how I wish I could have a dollar every time someone misspells rogue in this sub.
---
He had 30 damage here lol playing around three identical copies of a burst card in arena is absurd. OP had 26 health and there was 6 power in board.
---
Especially in this meta, where I think more cards are seeing play than beforehand, and it doesn't look like it's changing, it's easier to have a meta deck, Blizzard is doing well this expansion IMO and they're being generous enough to give us a few packs and all, it's definitely improving, I think the game is not that expensive, just to have a few good decks, especially since it's really easy to have meta decks as f2p now
---
I tried but it is impossible since it means you can't act anymore, all card draws are a cycle which means if I play power word shield at 10 cards I will have 9 then draw 1 that 1 can still be a bomb.
---
Which means the only way to keep 10 cards is not to play any card.
---
I sure you see the problem in this.
---
I just automatically check my connection if my opponent takes 30+ seconds because of these bullshit disconnects. They also never seem to hit my opponent, always just me.
---
RNG is RNG. It's the same as opening MTG boosters, or any other CCG.
---
I opened a similar amount of packs and made Bomb Warrior, Murloc Shaman, Mech Hunter, Vareesa Spell Hunter, Token Druid, Zoo Lock, Huge Pally, and a really shitty Silence Priest hahaha. I pulled Tak Nozwhisker but have nothing else for Rogue.
---
Bomb Warrior is jacked up/complete, followed by Mech Hunter, Murlocs, Zoo, and Huge Pally. Spell Hunter isn't bad but I only meme it. I could re-make Mid Beast Hunter too, especially if I craft Oondasta to throw in Huge Pally.
---
All that to say: I'm sorry your RNG didn't hit, but it varies for everyone. Better luck next time and have fun with Bomb Warrior! It's really fun (if you like hard control) except for mirrors.
---
By the pope
---
I know lol, I was trying to make a joke about how this looks almost identical to a classic force of nature savage roar combo with the three treants and the savage roar.
---
These posts are always very odd to me. You don’t need every card. In fact, most of the cards in an expansion are not good. It’s a pointless goal to aspire to unless you want to spend an inordinate amount of money - we all know that. However, you can play quote a lot of decks per expansion just through pre-orders and gold saving. 
---
Maybe you were just trying to evaluate the logistics of a complete collection, in which case that’s fine.
---
Yeah I think there are just stronger/more consistent alternatives to lackeys and being able to extend your deck by 10 cards doesn't rly do anything when there are almost no control-decks without an insanely strong lategame wincondition.
---
On a similar note, I have yet to see a single Zul'jin being played in wild.
---
Mind sharing a deck code for your weasel deck?
---
&gt; Its all about selective perception.

Nah, it's all about RNG.

---
Right off the bat, you need to know that my deck is Not competitive. I made this to troll in casual games with the weasel+Amara spam combo. Priest DK and Benedictus (or Elisiana) are Mandatory for this deck, because you will deck out Extremely fast, and Anduin pings are pretty much your only source of damage (which amplifies the suffering :)  
---
You can include whatever removal spells you want, only Excavated Evil is key to my strategy (fill their deck with useless cards)  
---
Barista is a Wonderful addition, an extra Amara at worst, can potentially get you an extra Zola in the late-game as well! You can just sub-in a Brewmaster, however, and he's honestly Better than Barista in most situations, Barista is just a bit of additional tempo. I used to run Herald Volaj to make more weasels with, and thanks to Shadowy Figure he's not Too hard to use anymore, but he's ultimately unnecessary.
---
I looked up your history and in one comment you wrote "habe"... That's not an english word.
---
Each set guarantees a Legendary within the first 10 packs that you open of that set. So, with that in mind:
---
Buy the Raven bundle to get 5 packs of: Witchwood, Boomsday, Rastakhan Rumble. Open them, and if you get your Legendary within the first 5 packs of that set then don't buy anymore. If you didn't get the Legend in the first 5 packs, pick a set and buy packs with gold or $$$ until you get the Legendary. Do that process until you have your Legendary from Witchwood, Boomsday, and Rastakhan.
---
After that, I'd spend half of what you have left on Classic packs, though you also get a fair chunk of those for ranking up.
---
After that, you want to get Rise of Shadows cards, again making sure to get at least 10 packs to get the guaranteed Legendary. You might even do that before the Classic buy.
---
Once you've bought all these cards, don't be too quick to dust any of them, especially Epics and Legends. Just make some decks and play, see what style of play you like, and start reading sites like hsreplay.net and hearthpwn to see what kind of decks people are playing with the Legendary cards you have in them.
---
Good luck and have fun!
---
The biggest thing I think the Hearthstone player base has an issue with is a lack of understanding of card games, blizzard is at fault too.
---
Most PvP card games are expensively own high power decks, I think HS is a lot of players first experience with this.
---
What blizzard fucks up is valuing your money because once you buy pack it loses value everywhere except on your region locked account.
---
Very tough situation all around.
---
In Ukraine, with its awful $200-300 average salary, Hearthstone is freaking EXPENSIVE. No sane person here would spend money on packs, because the chances of epics and legendaries are **low as hell**. 
---
I might spend money on some AAA title if I really like and want it, but spending the same money on packs to end with just two-three low tier legendaries and not being able to craft more than one deck?   
---
Screw that.
---
I dont think any of these cards are huge issues on their own.
---
Waggle pick is only good because of raiding party fishing out all your weapon synergizing pirates with it, and raiding party is only good because prep exists and is broken, miscreant is just a strong standalone card but I dont think it's one that's overwhelmingly powerful to the point that it needs a nerf.
---
the card that needs a nerf (and has needed one for a long time) is prep.
---
With the rotation you can safely dust extras of most wild cards.  That gave me around 18k dust along with the hall of fame .
---
Just farm arena. Its more fun and good for your wallet, and if you're a good enough player 7-9 wins shouldn't be a problem
---
They should just rework the draw mechanic,
---
This thread get's made a lot and I believe it's mostly a mindset-problem which leads to people feeling scammed.
---
Hearthstone is a grinding game. You play it and over time you'll gain resources which will allow you to play a variety of different decks.
---
Paying money for packs speeds up this process, but that's it. If your card collection is lacking in general, 80 packs of one expansion won't change that. You'll either have to put in more time or more money, and I recommend time.
---
According to some people I know who play Wild, you get a lot of Big Priest matchups, they say it's every other game, maybe that's exaggeration but still, it shows how common it is....
---
The deck looks aggressive, so teching in one card for a popular match-up isn't as much of a risk, if it's so common, winning those games would be worth a weaker game in other match-ups, especially if OP is experimenting..
---
I assume you are looking at metastats, and then at deck archetypes, instead of specific decks? And what timeframe are you looking at?   
---
I'm asking since,  [deck 1](http://metastats.net/deck/510789be-f375-4594-8f0d-d9f4a374811a/last4/) has a (almost) 50% winrate, and [deck 2](http://metastats.net/deck/e089a62d-7b6d-48d2-8f33-9d57cb775612/last4/), granted its a newer deck and doesnt have many matches yet, is well above 50%.   
---
And if you look at HSreplay, i count atleast 5 different resurrect priest lists with above 50% winrate.  
---
But like i said, i'm not at all saying priest is strong, or that it isnt a weak class. I'm just saying that there are deckslists you can play, that dont necessarily suck.
---
f
---
Yes. Essentially, it’s not in this build of the game, and the next build (patch) of the game is not arriving until after the bundle leaves.
---
she'd get half the collection in the divorce, and then you're worse off than you started!
---
Sorry r/hearthstone is so controlling over this stuff
---
"I have no idea what I'm capable of"
---
Celestia is secretly god tier.
---
Honestly though if it read it transforms into a 5/6 copy of the next minion your opponent plays it would be a half decent card imo.
---
Cool, thanks.

Don't you get tired of it tho? Maybe not, but if you do I'd recommend making the switch to wild.
---
Question re: HUGE Pally
---
I don't have Oondasta but am considering to craft for Huge Pally and Beast Hunter both.
---
If I didn't, is there a substitue for it? (Overkill: Summon minion from hand).
---
Also: Could I slot Deathwing in to HUGE Pally and just hope to not have to play it from hand? Would be a great Duel draw, not so much Prismastic fetch though...
---
Toki?
---
They should change divine spirit to 2 mana restore a minion to full health. So you can use it as removal but it also doesn't create this degenerate bullshit they need to balance around. As removal it would on par with execute and Hunters Mark as it would need an additional card.
---
interesting... I feels weird cause what is the win condition? It isn't control as you don't have enough control pieces. the tunnel blaster at  7 mana to deal with the board is too slow for zoo, how do you deal with that the board before hand mass hysteria on turn 5 is slow and kills your own board. The lacky stuff is also a bit strange to me as they scream more tempo play to develop the board and not really to control anything.  
---
if this is a control deck... then it feels strange and not enough to live. I feel like I would rather make it more res and tempo deathrattle focus. you don't have enough of an end game to finish off other control decks as well. so if you can make this more of a midrange deck that plays around tempo, I think it could work.
---
If you are playing Togwaggle then you often want to hold a lackey in your hand to activate it, with witchy being the most situational I would assume its also the most often held for Togwaggle.
---
As far as i know you get the rewards for finishing all wings, some packs for each wing completed.
---
Ok thx
---
On the omega cards : i think the warrior one is the only one played ? The warlock one is 5 mana for the same stats, and it’s a mech. I agree with you, The problem is not the stats but the battlecry.
---
I'm going to guess at 'something', since it makes sense in context. Not an abbreviation/acronym I've seen before though.
---
Hearthstone isn't a TCG...
---
Sorry but I don't see any decks that are +50% wr. Which decks do you see with it?
---
Stop, stop, I can only get so erect.
---
Spamming your own gambling website again :p
---
Drawing a mech from your deck is a lot more powerful than discovering one.
---
*Croclisks! All of you!*
---
I’ve played a version of this deck and it actually isn’t that terrible. If you run the 7 4/4 it can work even if you draw maly
---
Ok thx. That makes sense. I'll probably do that.
---
It's not just the rush, it's the armor too. While I get the 7 meme around Dr. Boom, the fact that he gives more armor than all the other hero cards is just silly.
---
The 7 meme comes back with his blast shield hero power which is way too effective. 7 armor felt okish compared to odd-warrior, hell it's only 3 more. Compared to your regular hero power it's 5 more.. That is 3.5 times as much, that is just silly.
---
Combining both effects on turn 9 yields 14 armor. Now compare this to Jaraxxus who sets (and caps) your health at 15.
---
Even Control Warrior plays Eternum Rover and Town Crier.
---
"Add a random mech to your hand" sounds more balanced.
---
Added
---
I dunno, he's situational but can be effective, especially when combo'd with Khadgar
---
We get a new hero skin when we get the adventure content? Any idea what the skin might be? Will we be able to use it outside of the adventure content (as in on ladder or casual)?
---
There's a variant that I saw and tried with a mech package instead of Oondasta.  It has Bull Dozers and Damaged Stegatrons and has Kangor's Endless Army.  Seemed good, especially since the Dozers are two more excellent Redemtion targets.
---
Deathwing seems okay if you're missing something.  I don't know what you're missing or the rest of your collection, but it's totally reasonable to engage in this sort of out-of-the-box thinking if you can't netdeck something card-for-card.
---
I still don't get it though how you oy managed one deck. I preordered the 50 pack, had no gold for packs, and about 1000 dust saved up. Yet I've managed to craft at least two decks that I wanted (giant mage and handlock), mainly cause I had the cards, I'm sat on 6000 dust (waiting to see what I fancy playing) and I still have a lot of cards I'm happy to dust that are now in wild, including all the gold duplicates. Oh, and I also had the worst luck with opening legendaries, only opening the one you get in the first 10 packs and the pity legendary.
---
F2P btw haHAA
---
So this is what Firebat means when he says that information isn't really all that important in HS.
---
hof not a nerf
---
actually hard to say as I can't really see the whole collection. Here is a list that Kibler runs. [https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1268405-kibler-s-deathrattle-priest](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1268405-kibler-s-deathrattle-priest)
---
Ehm no. A lot of people (my self included) have reported having stealth disconnects. Even if it's because of the connection the game should try to reconnect instead of just hanging.
---
I’ve had the same issue since the expansion dropped. Not sure if it’s to do with WiFi connection or not. I still get the “You have been disconnected from your game” message rarely, but I get the phantom disconnect much more often.
---
I also think he is highly exaggerating, I thought the 50 packs and I can built: Bomb Warrior; Cotrol Warrior; Both Mage Decks; Recurrect Priest; Tempo Rouge; Midrange Hunter.
---
I am missing about 5 legendaries from this Expansion, none of them is needed for the decks I play.
---
huntertaker in naxx aswell, worst matchup was mirror(undertaker,unleash,lepergnome,abusive,buzzard,arcane golem,,owl all got nerfed from that period)
---
If this guy plays MTGA he wil go on mtg reddit an say: RDW plays to much burn, weenies "I don't want to mindlessly flood the board with minions to use one card so I can hit someone for 30" and esper "I don't want to turtle all game". These are just typical tactics in card games, every game has them.
---
Arena?! Holy
---
Is quest still there? Just sent you a friend request.
---
Also, a small bonus - Pyroblast would have given me lethal had my opponent not got two taunts from Power of Creation.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/d7zXyVd.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/d7zXyVd.jpg)

I thought it would be a shame for my Pyroblast to go to waste so I put it to good use. On my face.

Branching paths and malf the pestilent are laughing in the corner.

Those aren't villains from Hearthstone. Team 5 is keeping it to their own characters as far as the antagonists are concerned. 
---
Plus, Blizzard generally would not let Team 5 write a light-hearted, Hearthstone story with Kel'Thuzad, the Lich King, or Nefarian when they haven't written much new for any of those characters in years. 
---
They'll let them retell the stories, yes, but I don't think having them Lich King work with joke characters like Dr. Boom and King Togwaggle to steal something would exactly make sense for such a tragic and conquest oriented character.
---
Not with the amount of taunt in arena.
---
&gt; The one i tip always flops the hardest.
---
Well, that Hearthstone... Whoever will draw the best and queue into right matchups will probably win.
---

---
Yeah I would have liked to do that, if I ever get to 11 wins again, I'll remember to^.
---
I feel your pain, I still remember getting Kazakhus (or however you spell him) in an early draft and failing completely. At least now I know why people usually go for the 5-cost spell, haha.
---
I agree that it is pretty weird that Elek shuffle more cards into the opponent deck as well, even the animation is broken
---
The client is a lot more unstable since the last patch, yes, but it's not the hovering card thingie. It happens randomly when you try to play something or with certain card interactions and then you get reconnected most of the time.
---
He describes the normal "card hovering" thing which is around for years and which is caused by your bad connection.
---
It says gay priest in the title duh

Hey santaboi, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters.

You made a deck that cost 13k dust before the meta settled. That’s not blizzards fault. 
---
I spent the same as you, but I haven’t crafted hardly at all and I’m sitting on a nice little chunk of dust to craft up a few decks when I feel like it’s going to be worth it
---
As an occasional BP user this is the very reason why I started hating Barnes and just removed him from my version. Even though I've moved away from BP because it was too boring to play, I think the deck is much better and more consistent without him.
---
Mic drop.

The flip side of that is that it often costs over a hundred bucks (sometime even up to 400) to have a tier one standard deck (in magic at least). Hearthstone is expensive but it's leaps and bounds cheaper than paper. You can cash out with paper but if you dont do so far from rotation you are still going to take a hit similar to the cost of playing hearthstone.
---
Yeah, I've played it, but I can't get a good winrate with it because I can't balance out my draws, either I draw too little or draw too much.
---
43 - 12 with token druid. only thing that beats me is taunt priest (which loses to everything else) and sometimes rogue, if they have a perfect start.
---
5/6 stealth yeti that disrupts your opponent wouls be played in just about every deck.  Just +1/+1 is a pretty big upside already.
---
Probably. I prefer Rogue now though, it's less linear surely.
---
He did play two Messenger Ravens, to be honest. That damn bird carries Kalecgos on its back all the time.
---
How are you going to splintercraft hireek if it fills you rboard tho
---
good priest decks always come later in the meta. every time. enjoy the meta now until someone smarter than us finds out the exact combination of priest cards to make a great deck then ill just switch to arena till the priests are gone from ladder
---
This guy is legit, I have traded with him before
---
I'd probably recommend translating it through less languages next time. 
---
It's funny when there's some kind of relevance, like a 3 part card with really obscure definitions for all three that make you go, I can see how it made that that transistion.
---
Most of these are so far from the original text that it just feels like random sentence generators.
---
Per month
---
Rexxar just had so much more potential for absolute bullshit. Rush, lifesteal, poisonous, AoE, all or some of them combined. It just felt bad to lose against.
---
You're the one getting dramatic making hyperbole out of what I said. I'm just saying it feels shitty how little you get for your money compared to other genres. The amount of time I play isn't consequential to how shitty it feels. I'm just saying I'd rather invest my money elsewhere in something which actually gives me value for my money. Sorry if that upsets you.
---
If i was in my last few picks and only had one big minion in my deck already i would draft a second one for sure.
---
You know, not all decks in every meta can work as the toolbox deck, right?.
---
And even shaman could win from behind, like token druid can win from behind, like tempo rogue can win from behind. Even pirate warrior could still win from behind. This does not make the deck worse or better. It dictates its playstile, its strenghts and weaknesses.
---
don't delete your post it was good?
---
[I survived to play it too!](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/k29fHRM)
---
While polarization has been an issue in the game in the past and isn't made better by the lack of side board play. It really isn't that bad right now outside of Wild, which is a natural result of it being an Eternal format.
---
Sometimes, decks will end up hard countering other decks like Mech Hunter with Control Warrior, but working on increasing your chances of winning bad match-ups can still be done and will have a greater impact on your overall winrate more so than completely banking on your deck's good match-ups.
---
Two would have been exact lethal already.
---
Cute combo
---
Game isn’t stale it just sucks. Druids win the game by turn 5 way too often and I don’t just mean like oh looks like it’s over I mean I’ve literally killed them by my turn 5. Rogue is just cheesing it’s way to legend with that fucking draw 2 pirates and a weapon shit and infinite lackeys. And warrior is its usual self having a deck full of removal and never actually doing anything just outlasting.
---
Right? I'm having flashbacks of people spelling it wrong in WoW all the time ten years ago.
---
But its not a bad thing at all, it has proven to be what makes every class/color feel distinct, and makes player better when identifying this differences (go wide against druid or hunter, dont go tall against hunter, be carefull with your deathrattle minions against priest/mage/shaman, etc...)
---
You play Hi’reek before trading one of your dudes into an enemy which gives you boardspace!
---
Never got past rank 5, but probably don’t play nearly enough. Gratz
---
And then fireball
---
I'm pretty sure that matchup is very even, if rogue is able to control the board early with backstab / SI7 early then it's not that difficult to win. Hardest thing to deal with is probably whispering woods for 6 or 7
---
You need them for draw and early board control. What meta are you playing in that priest can wait till 4 or 5 to drop tokens that need to be healed? It's the only low roll minion.
---
To be fair, he only saw the Pyro last after the taunts where already on the board so he never had the "oh my Gobi have lethal" feeling
---
Hey, thanks for this huge info. Was looking for such a thread but it seems im lacking some internet skills..
---
I did open a ticket now and will see what the german support is going to answer. I dont expect anything.
---
&gt;I'm just saying I'd rather invest my money elsewhere
---
Then do so? Literally no one forces you to invest anything into this game.
---
But its not like you say. Matchup spreads are arround 40/60 in most of the meta decks right now. A bad matchup will be a 40% chance of winning for you. It doesnt mean that you lost because of the choice of your deck, it means you are against a deck that has better answers for your strategy, and its harder to overcome. Still, not a polaricing matchup at all, pretty affordable.
---
If you keep feeling that matchup and rng is 100% of what makes you win or lose, you probably know very very little about the game. You cant improve as a player with that mentality.
---
Despite the card saying, "**Your opponent casts a spell**" your opponent is not actually casting a spell.  Got it.
---
Opponant must be unliterate
---
I actually love the lackeys. Wasn’t looking forward to them at all before the expansions’s release. Only problem I have is some classes generate lackeys better than others (Rogue).
---
I’m excited to see more lackey generators in the other sets this year.
---
it sounds like you are not very good at control because anytime there are tempo decks, control decks are favored. I see almost NO combo decks. There is no excuse you shouldn't be enjoying mopping up tempo decks. Losing every once in a while to an aggro murloc shaman shouldn't be bringing down your WR from winning against every other tempo deck. I mean control shaman has some insane removal tools + infinite value. Same with control warrior (which I find way more boring personally). Those are top tier decks. Obviously people are piloting them better than you.
---
Only thing I agree on is token druid. As a control deck, you can only effectively tech for either rogue or druid but not both, so it feels bad to prepare for the rogues and get hit with the druids instead but thats just life.

---
i dislike aggro decks. thanks Dev for not bringing them back
---
did you win? they're only 6/6s but two in a row could be brutal lol
---
this is assuming that ANYONE with a brain still uses Togwaggle in a tempo rogue deck. Not to hate on the XL kobold, but he's not a tempo tool. He's value, everyone knows that. You should worry more about a waggle pick slapping you in the face for three consecutive turns followed by two kisses from the only finisher worth a darn.
---
Curious about how you're going to lose? Check these 5 easy steps now!
---
&gt; Hagatha generates 'unlimited' value too
---
I mean, it's only unlimited as long as you have minions in hand.
---
And the average spell generated is probably worse than Darkbomb which is one of the "low roll"s on Dr Boom's hero power.
---
Then maybe a ressurection-based decklist doesn't work with the current support available.
---
Wait so you didn't even try for [Tanglefur Mystic] + 2 drop heal?
---
lol
---
I haven't checked since like week 1 but week 1 Rafaam had a surprisingly high drawn/ played WR. I suspected it had a low WR and wanted to cut it but the numbers said the opposite.
---
How big is this god damn raven?
---
he has fallen victim to the classic placebo 12 wins
---
You don't really need to draw against Big Priest since it tends to be so slow. They only have so many threats, and we can steal them all.
---
Tell us the results. thanks

I'm still dead if I do that. I can only remove 4 damage, and I'd be able to heal myself for only 6.
---
&gt; Dr. Boom, Mad Genius is the worst infinite value generator in the whole game. It's only one-fifth of a card per turn on average. If you find yourself losing to Dr. Boom repeatedly, it's not because of Delivery Drone (unless your opponent gets it every other turn). 
---
This is a terrible argument.
---
[[Darkbomb]] is a card (a pretty good card: it gets played in wild).  Dr Boom's hero power is often Darkbomb (either the laser, or generate three 1/1s with rush).
---
If people get to call random spells generated off of Hagatha "value" then rolling darkbomb is DEFINITELY value.  Maybe not as much value as delivery drone, but it's certainly MORE value than most other hero powers.

Not at all compared to KT. You have to have a board presence either way with both characters but w/ Jaraxx you put yourself at a risk that you don't with KT.
---
I'm also playing MTG arena and this is what made me make this Topic, because in MTG arena each expansion brings whole new decks that don't need previous packs to be good or fun.
---
Well it depends 3 mana draw backstab is kinda troll. The paladin card is safer depending on what the lowest minion is, a 3/3 argent squire is nuts.
---
Much better.
---
It's almost as if people hate playing against warrior and will play decks that can win the matchup?
---
nomi priest DESTROY this deck
---
Take 9 stats and distribute it how you like. That’s probably the top of the power curve for this kind of effect.
---
Bomb Warrior is a new archetype. 
---
Darkest Hour Warlock is a new archetype. 
---
Big/Duel Paladin is a new archetype.
---
Hunting Party Hunter is a new archetype.
---
f2p players may have 80 packs by the end of the expansion, but for most of the expansion they have a very small amount of packs - especially at the start when p2p players show off their new decks and they can't participate in this hype. By the time they have a decent amount of packs, a new expansion comes along and there is another set of cards they have to wait for the gold for.
---
This is especially the case after 3 expansions rotate because the dependency on having cards from the latest expansion is at its highest throughout the year assuming all expansions are of equal 'power'.
---
I craften some (Boom and Catrina) had 1k Gold for packs on release and opened 1 Pack/day with free gold.  
---
Got to mention thogh that I crafted all the cards which rotated to get free dust.
---
Is it true that Rafaam sometimes turn a very bad match-up into a favorable one? I like his art, his entry line and music. I may craft him.
---
What did he say?
---
Tempo rogue is fun enough in my opinion, I'm also trying to grind to legend. Would you suggest crafting nomi? I've been playing token druid to bust through to 5, now it's starting to curb. Would you suggest crafting nomi?
---
It's a wholesome version.^/s
---
Yes, I remember freeze mage being quite hard to pilot correctly. Same with old school handlock, the  first deck I took to legend. Now even with multiple board clears and jaraxus, warrior can still out value in the late game and push fatigue. It's nuts and dare I say it, unfun.
---
Well your opponent does not know you have Jaraxxus in hand and might have a dead turn some time in the end game.
---
Token Druid vs Rogue is even/slightly rogue favoured according to HSReplay.  (50.6% winrate for Rogue).

I just got Jepetto and haven't tried him out yet.  I really like the idea of pulling Hireek out with him....meme deck coming today.
---
Yea but you need to be 2nd with the coin and "the nuts" to be able to dump out a 12/12 edwin or something. You're all in at that point.
---
Having sap against that means you auto-win. Not having sap means that you might still win, you just need to fight a bit more.
---
I think all the classes have the tools to deal with a big edwin early. It's just a matter of drawing it. Then again it's not like you can get off the huge edwin turns every game lol. I think it's fine.
---
I'm 12 games away from golden priest and I have been since the rotation - not for without trying.
---
He knew what deck he was playing against. A tempo rogue is not going to play a large taunt and probably isn't running vanish. They're also not going to do 26 from hand and no board.
---
I don't think people hate Big Rogue, surely? It's much less RNG dependent and generally feels more fair.
---
Haha yeah I troll low rank wild with Weasel Priest as well, and wanted to compare decks to see if I can make any updates to mine. Adding in Barista definitely sounds interesting. Thanks for the post!
---
DK Rexxar can rot in hell, it singlehandedly covered every weakness Spell Hunter had (healing, lots of board clears and gives minions long after you've run out of steam).
---
The opponent has a Pyroblast so OP is screwed
---
am i missing something? why is kelthuzad in arena?

I was thinking more of Wild Growth and Nourish getting hit instead of UI, or Flametongue getting nerfed instead of Genn.
---
Sums it up.
---
"How do I beat Rogue?" "Well...they have a &gt;50% winrate against literally every deck but Warrior" "Well, do I want to spend 6800 dust to craft the warrior cards I  never opened?  No not really."
---
My friend and I tried after, but we also failed to queue up again
---
Yeah, I just won with wild growth turn 1, jade blossom turn 2, nourish + jade blossom turn 3, and UI turn 4.  My opponent conceded.
---
that's not a psa. its just a statement
---
Yeah, I believe this is the Tavern Brawl that lets you play with decks exactly as they were played in Championship games. It's one of my faves! :)
---
Usually zoos endgame when behind was drawing into doomguard to close out the game.  That was how you usually won against control decks. They can’t do that anymore. They have a strong earlygame but needs Rafaam to beat decks when plan A fails.
---
Yogg still nerfed in this brawl?
---
My point is that when magnetized zilliax can provide a huge heal that is impossible to counterplay as it's a rush effect.
---
In general, I feel that magnetizing should work like evolve where the minion goes to sleep once you magnetize it rather than be able to attack the same turn.
---
I'm enjoying it. Aside from warrior. I don';t care if it's balanced or not, it's just anti-fun to play against it.
---
Why did someone down vote our entire conversation? People are weird
---
Thanks :)
---
oh, thats why.
---
Played the prenerf cubelock.  Makes me happy that it is gone.
---
Oh my God is prenerf Raza priest back?!?! I'm deadass gonna play this brawl for the next 120 hours .
---
IDK if this happened the last time this format showed up, but:  When you learn which deck you're piloting, your *player name* switches to the champ who originated it. so I've had Firebat's Warlock twice and "became" Firebat both times
---
You are exactly correct.
---
Good sensible changes. I'd leave Booms hero power though, i'd just take the rush off mechs.
---
That's fine, but less posts is also good. We don't need garbage to fill the space.
---
Thank you, I haven't been in a math class in like 2 years. And yea, I can see why they gave it to mage. I also wouldn't be surprised to see them dilute the pool a little, though, like they did with Paladin before.
---
What rank? The only card I somewhat regularly lose to is Mechanical Whelp and I don't see enough of them to run 2 silences let alone 1.
---
some decks would still play him at 6 mana
---
This is good for people who have most classic cards. I've been playing for a year and I'm missing 18 classic leg. No point hoarding packs till august.
---
the first time I thought I was going to get legend , someone top deck an owl out of 19 card and manage to silence the minion I had frost to get lethal and finish me.

I hit legend 2 years later xD

It's the same dust either way. If you want the dust sooner rather than later then go ahead. This advice is more for people who have plenty of cards/dust already and are looking to get optimum value.
---
HDT
---
It’s based on people who run hearthstone deck tracker and their opponents
---
I used the one on Tempostorm during the last meta snapshot with coldlights
---
Is this allowed?  I thought this was a hate sub...
---
Yeah, that deck is broken
---
I disagree. It's not rocket science but it does require decision making. There are multiple autopilot decks in t1-t3 currently.
---
Maybe if you played your doctor the turn before....
---
The decks are tied to classes in an weird way. People have reported completing quests for classes they weren’t piloting for this brawl.
---
I think the idea is that the raven delivers a message that the character is needed and they come to help
---
Maybe in the dirt? High rank token druids know how to play around warrior clears.
---
With UI and spellstones absolutely. It’s basically an auto win in this brawl if you know how to play the deck properly
---
Ohh I see. I actually just read the summary of the Q&amp;A and they wrote that “there will be replacements for the two Witchwood legendaries”

I guess the writer misunderstood.

---
&gt; Can you play any of these new archtypes with just the cards from the new pack in an efficient manner?
---
You're moving the goalposts a little bit, but no, you pretty much can't play any archetype with a single expansion's cards "in an efficient manner." Even the top decks during WotOG, arguably the most thematically-focused expansion in HS history, used older cards.
---
I'm surprised that would be an important consideration for a wild only player. 
---
And would such singular focus on a particular archetype/playstyle actually be any good? What if you didn't like the archetype they were pushing for a class - you just don't play any new cards for that class? No thanks.
---
Rafaam occasionally high-rolls people. Otherwise it is the exact opposite of everything a Zoo deck is trying to achieve: consistency.
---
I'm convinced that Zoo vs Warrior isn't as bad as people think, people just tend to suck with Zoo because they underestimate its complexity. Tiny decisions, e.g. tapping vs committing to the board or trading vs going face, have huge implications. You win if the Warrior has to use his removal suboptimally.
---
They need to start awarding the current expansions packs with TB
---
My bad then. Not a native English speaker. Just wanted to make it clear that I was not bitching.
---
That's wrong; token druid is slightly favored against both control warrior and bomb warrior.
---
Yeah, worked for me after like 15 minutes keeping the app down.
---
Good old HS RNG!
---
Looking at these lists made me realize that we will never see Odd/Even decks in the World Championship and never in this brawl :O
---
It seems better but when it comes to Mecha’Thun combos requiring more cards is usually better because it means that many non-combo cards you have to play before to can pay the combo
---
I play any kind of druid. It is a favorite class of mine. I hate Jades and I never played Star Aligner in wild but whenever there is a viable druid deck that I don't hate I will play it.
---
*firebat's evil laugh intensifies*
---
[The board I had as Big Rogue on turn 5](https://i.imgur.com/ShkHBsD.jpg) was more unfair than most decks I've run.
---
If your aggressive deck hasn't killed the controling opponent by the time a Dyn-o-matic or Omega Defender gets dropped and a Zilliax magnetized to it in the same turn, you probably weren't going to win anyway. 
---
Baring Zilliax and War Gear, all Magnetic minions are overcosted as both a minion and a buff card as is and making the little played mechanic even weaker because of a single over-performing card would not be a good change for the game.
---
[[Deadly Shot]]
---
Official opinion of the devs about Zilliax [Source] (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/hearthstone/t/rise-of-shadows-q-a-april-22-2019/4056/330) :
---
We like the way Zilliax is being used. As such a flexible card (due to having so many keywords) Zilliax naturally finds his way into a variety of decks for different reasons, and we like this. Some decks really value the Lifesteal, some value the Mech minion type, some use him to synergize with Rush or Taunt cards. Often how he interacts in each game or deck feels different and less repetitive. In general, Zilliax just feels great to play and doesn’t feel awful to play against so we’re pretty happy where he is right now.

Dude just play cutlass into the 1 drops and the cutlass will be buffed to 2/7. Thats like 14 points of healing. **the value**
---
This sub is slowly turning into r/RocketLeague, which is a shame cos it was much better than that
---
My first two games were the same match up!!!  Me as Pavel's Mage vs Grim Patron Warrior.  What are the chances??
---
I won both games.
---
Those hogsteads are more playable.
---
Yeah, not sure which is better overall. Adding more control cards could also be a risk if you can't use them.
---
My hunch says more combo cards is better since the scenario when it sucks is more up to chance, whereas an opponent can play against you in such a way it's hard to use your control cards.
---
Yeah, the name changes did happen last time too
---
What are friends and how do i get those?
---
He did. Best play was to still do nothing because there was no reason to do anything when next turn is pretty much guaranteed win.
---
If your current board state all but guarantees a win, you do nothing.
---
ok
---
I lost 3 in a row n gave up for now lol,
---
Check out old Undertaker Hunter in it's prenerf form. If you don't know, Leper Gnome used to have 2 attack and Undertaker is a 1 drop 1/2 and had "every time you play a deathrattle minion, gain +1/+1." That deck was a nightmare, and I didnt mention the other prenerfed cards in there haha
---
Agree to disagree. It's really, really not challenging to learn to cycle with those cards and given the number of 0-1s it's incredibly trivial to fuel the engine. Bad players are decking themselves by turn 8-9.
---
I liked that he immediately played the second one to be absolutely sure it wasn't a bug before armoring up.
---
In all honesty it's probably a bot.
---
What hype?
---
While pre-nerf even paladin was certainly a very strong deck, to the point where it was fairly dominant in the witchwood meta. I would say that pre-nerf Jade Druid was much more dominant in its meta and had a higher power level overall.
---
And that assumes standard decks only, the most overpowered deck from wild was probably either Pre nerf Raza priest or pre nerf star aligner druid.
---
Big Shaman is so expensive but looks fun.
---
You get them by beating someone while having at least 1 lucky draw during the game. Your opponent then adds you as a friend so they can tell you what a dumbass fucking RNG noob you are. It's a nice little system.
---
Beat the expert paladin using your advice.
---
His jawline is pretty sexy how cant u recpgnise it?
---
Khadgar Dragon Hand Mage is a good deck if you can spare some dust to craft 2 book of spectres. I'm personally using it to climb to legend right now, and am at rank 2 while win streaking hard until 5. You might want to consider craft Zilliax though. He is in almost every top deck that is not all out aggro right now.
---
Same person that though that 5 mana Spreading Plague is a fair thing.
---
I know, I was joking because he said as soon as you have magnetic cards it's good, but there are no magnetic cards in Arena.
---
Til that it isn't the meta, it's just hearthstone...
---
This shouldnt be an important factor, data consumption by games is very small. The problem is that hearthstone will sometimes decide that its needs to be updated and you will have to wait for wifi in that case .
---
Disguised toast
---
Wow, just played the Jade Druid deck and it is BONKERS!  Loved it!
---
The one you get for winning a game in the weekly brawl
---
Well done blizz, I really like this brawl I think it’s a lot of fun to get to pilot these awesome decks
---
rogue has almost always been at or near top tier, and almost every good rogue deck outside of odd rogue has worked by abusing preperation.
---
rogue spell design space has been limited since the dawn of time because of preperation.
---
you nerf miscreant and pick and then the next time any decent rogue cards come out the class will become broken again because of preperation.
---
the correct card to nerf is preperation and its been LONG overdue
---
Info is in the original content. Waggle Pick, shadowstep, Leeroy? That's almost certainly tempo rogue. And most people play standard.
---
Would have to check stats but it is probably not common to run in tempo rogue. Vanish kills tempo most of the time.
---
Just made me check...I used to think it didnt...
---
But apparently I've used about 2 gigs worth each month for the last 3 months. I say I average about 45 minutes each day
---
Oh so that is a friend? Great then i do have a few friends that seem to hate me &lt;3
---
/r/wooosh
---
F2p hunter. I climbed quite a bit with it in the low ranks.
---
and Flarkmaster Boom!
---
Can i get an ACTUAL hunter deck for this brawl? I have Oasis Snapjaw and Timber Wolf in it, however i don't see them in Firebat's list. Also there is no Snake Trap
---
Any of the warrior decks are meme tier easy if you can afford them.
---
Casual has an MMR that you can’t see. 
---
I usually squelch at the first emote by the opponent. 
---
There are no stakes in casual so it doesn’t matter. Other than time spent versus gold earned...there are no stakes. 
---
There’s not a rule that you can’t play well constructed decks in casual. If you lose a bunch your MMR will reflect that and you’ll start to see fewer skilled opponents with more and more janky decks.
---
Can someone explain what I'm looking at here? I'm a nub
---
And why is that?
---
[[Annoy-o-Tron]] [[Giggling Inventor]] [[Lesser Diamond Spellstone]]
---
I got hunter vs freeze mage.  He played a Doomsayer into my Leper Gnome to bypass Ice Block.  I laughed.

7/-/- | Resurrect 2 different friendly minions. (Cast 4 spells to upgrade.)  
---
rank25 btw
---
I’d say the bundles are the only things you should buy.
---
I think casual is based off of your MMR and never really resets. Just keep conceeding then.
---
Schrodinger’s comment: the comment that is both the top comment and not the top comment
---
Could you include his username? He deleted his post and I'd like to remain aware. Also, thank you for taking the time to notice other people about it!
---
I think Token Druid is kinda hard when you get to higher ranks. Some of the comboes aren't initially obvious also.
---
A little tip I picked up a while back was to throw up a stream on twitch, and then you just get better RNG all around.
---
Too many rogues, too many rogues!
---
Warrior is cancer right now. your description of your mass with your boyfriend is basically everyone's frustration with the game right now lol
---
Choose the 2/4 Keeper, is the obvious winner
---
Midrange Hunter is a good climbing deck and cheap. Most expensive cards are Savannah Highmane (rare), Shimmerfly (rare)... I think the rest are commons.
---
This is of course omitting Master's Call (epic) since you can then run stuff like Houndmaster. It's not optimal but it's cheap.
---
I can probably post a rough list.
---
Also without Zul'jin, you can also find a replacement for the twin spell.
---
Picture posts that are posted without context are usually "fun" posts meant more as a joke, or a 'look at that crazy thing that happened!'. 
---
You're basically asking them to ruin the punchline/fun in the title, for the sake of the handful of new players who don't know meta decks and the like.
---
If these posts are upvoted, it's likely that the majority of the users figured out what the picture was about.
---
That's the thing about secrets. One secret will be good against one matchup and bad for another. I like the flexibility of the discover card since you usually aren't playing something on turn 1 anyway
---
J Alexander, love your work, but I will respectfully disagree here.
---
I think Prep could pretty easily be “your next spell costs 2 less”, and it would still be good and still feel like rogue.  You could still prep evis.  But it would make prep raiding party a weaker play, and specifically it would weaken prep raiding party edwin significantly.
---
I think changing prep to reduce the next spell by 2 instead of 3 would keep it good and keep it in most rogue decks.
---
And sure, I recognize you could achieve a similar effect by making raiding party cost 4, but I will say that times when Rogue have been able to reduce a 3+ cost spell it’s always been obnoxiously strong.  Tinkerer’s Sharpsword Oil?  Ridiculous with prep.  Crystal Core?  Ridiculous with prep.  It seems like a card that will continue to cause problems whenever there are 3+ mana spells in Rogue.
---
Warriors easy at low ranks but at higher ranks, knowing when to hold onto Brawl and Warpath can matter.
---
Prep and Sprint might be on the block for the next HoF/change round... Sprint was only costed that high iirc because Prep was available... losing that would be possibly a way to change Prep for 6 mana (similar to Nourish being a draw 3 effect with the choose option).
---
I mean, Rogue has certainly “been hit,” Cold Blood was nerfed like two months ago. 
---
Going back further, Conceal was rotated out, and back in 2016 both Blade Flurry and Master of Disguise were nerfed (into unplayability).
---
Rogue still has great classic tools in cards like Eviscerate, Edwin and Prep but let’s not pretend that it’s completely unchanged.
---
Ugh, I always dislike this brawl. They could at least match decks made within 1 year with each other. Getting freeze mage into DK jade druid or 2014 midrange/control druid into cubelock just isn’t even remotely fair. It’s not even interesting.
---
laughs in 简体字
---
my question is what draws skilled opponents to the casual format in the first place
---
I understand wanting to get in a game when maybe you might forsee a possible disconnect, or are on mobile with a low battery...who knows
---
But to hit a consistent wall of high skill players in the casual format? Am I just wrong for thinking that, on paper, that sounds kind of absurd? Hearthstone gives you NO incentive to not be playing ranked (except for losing stars, thus I didn't que for whizbang in ranked) 
---
The thing is that I do desire to play against skilled opponents... I don't want my opponents knowledge of the game to be any worse, I just want to escape from the same few ranked decks that people use to climb.
---
 If I just chain concede do you think my MMR will go down in a decent amount of time?
---
/r/woooosh
---
nana nana nana nana nana nana nana nana HI'REEK!
---
I always start with a greeting emote and if the person doesn't immediately reply with their greetings, I squelch. I started doing this after experiencing what's happening to you and it's pretty effective.
---
So 50% of the time, you can concede at mulligan in Mecha'thun Paladin?

facepalm  
---
Lmao sprint IS a bad card, that's literally the point - that prep allows it to be played in traditional rogue decks. Balance of sprint has nothing to do with anything. Prep just allows rogue to do what the class is intended to do.
---
What OS are you using that the screen looks like that?
---
I do that sometimes, so sure.
---
Lol yeah I’ve lost a few games due to Netflix / computer screen distractions
---
There are only 8 classes anyway
---
Hmm any ideas?
---
 Isn't it just the new Legendaries they've released for mage hunter paladin druid? The villains are the new class legendaries Boom, Hagatha, Rafaam and Lazul.
---
So, Khadgar for Mage, Alleria for Hunter, Rhyssa for paladin, and whichever for Druid I assume Keeper.
---
I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted. I think what you're saying is mostly correct, Dr Boom Mad Genius is not the value generator people are claiming it to be, not even close. The reason why it feels relatively unfair is because they can use their omega devastators to remove something, and instantly use the rush on them to trade with something else. The same problem pops up with dyn o matic. 
---
The only nerf that I could see happening without actively damaging flavor would be to only give the first mech you play each turn rush. That way it'll still have some battlecry (Lets be real, removing the battlecry from the card entirely would just feel bad.) but it limits the direct amount of tools they can use to control it. I know people are going to complain: "But that's not going to do enough!". Trust me, it'll probably have more impact than you consider and it forces them to consider how to deal with each threat more carefully. That and yeah, dynomatic nerfs.
---
Anyone know why Talanji summons in that order? It’s different to the order in hand...
---
All this salt and no pepper.
---
It's too late to Nerf Barnes. Vargoth and muerte have already pushed the deck over the edge. At this point all they can do is rework the graveyard as a whole or nuke servitude and resurrect from orbit.
---
UN-NERF YOGG
---
The faint imprint just behind the text that indicates which set the card is from. The Keeper on the left has the Classic swirl, the Gloom Stag has the Hall of Fame emblem, and the Keeper on the right has no stamp because it's uncollectible. It's also not supposed to have a rarity gem for the same reason (or perhaps it should have had a Classic stamp as well if it was meant to look authentic), but evidently that was overlooked.
---
When the meta plays you.

What does transformation popularity mean. Chance that it happens? How is one so much higher.
