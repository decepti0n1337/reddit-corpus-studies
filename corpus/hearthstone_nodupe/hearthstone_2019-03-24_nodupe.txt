Yeah, volcano is the coolest interaction in the game with the game board! I wish we had more of them in the past and also in the future. :/

---
---
One for all and all for me.
---
Daily quest completion and 10 gold per 3 wins
---
What they aren't showing you are the 1 cost hero cards and legendaries they always seem to get off of espionage
---
A bit late: I have normal baku and genn. 2x Normal gloom stag. 2x golden black cat. 2x murkspark eel. 0 glitter moths. So the best I can do with 3800 dust is making 2 golden glitter moths? 
---
Just do magnetic using DFC tech ;)
---
People could just be screwing around a bit because of the rotation coming up? Toast was like rank 10 for awhile because he didn't care. Granted he was playing really bad decks probably, but still? Also people could be playing less and are just now coming back in preparation for the expansion maybe so you're catching good players now climbing the ranks? Just two random thoughts. Could be totally wrong. 
---
You realize we can see your log on the side, right?
---

---
You swung with a weapon, played Tools of the Trade which equipped the Stake Thrower and swung again.
---
If he really wanted to BM, he would do lethal damage with that last 2 attack minion.
---
Congrats! I love seeing posts like these. Reminds me of my first time reaching rank 5 :')
---
Maybe because of the format, certainly not the games. The level was very low and a few people didn't even know how to play some of their decks. Like at all.
---
Yea, but what's it do?
---
That's a lot of spells that don't provide a body. Very different. They are a 0 for 1 that so nothing but heal, effectively. They certainly don't kill 2 creatures on the way.
---
Also, Lifesteal works on Effect Damage as well.
---
draw your last pathetic card yugi
---
Changing it to "after damage calculation" would suit it better.

Trading 80g quest. We'll show and you go first!

Itâ€™s what you use to craft cards 
---
Stuff you use to craft cards.
---
Everyone is saying to dust Dorian, but I always hesitate dusting anything with such a unique effect. Are there other cards you can dust to make up the difference?
---
Again, nothing. Just flashy.
---
So letâ€™s say you have a card that you really want to craft, for example a legendary card.
---
But the only way to obtain cards in this game is to either be lucky (from packs) or craft them (using arcane dust) 
---
You can get arcane dusts from arenas or by disenchanting other cards. 
---
For example: you have 4 epic cards that you donâ€™t want, you go ahead and disenchant them, they turn into dust, then you can craft the cards you want.

Well in Wild, the last Molten Reflection (after all pieces cheapened by Emp.) creates a Fireball, so you don't even need a spare spell.
---
[removed]
---
Woops. That's why I got down voted. I meant to say "Mecha Jaraxxus" not mechathun
---
You get dust from destroying cards and you use it to craft cards you want.
---
Common cards give 5 dust when disenchanted and cost 40 to make
---
Rare cards give 20 and cost 100
---
Epics give 40 and cost 400
---
Legendaries give 400 and cost 1600
---
Golden cards give more when disenchanted and all costs for making them are double the regular ones
---
You mean I would be able to beat someone that's basically AFK (but only going first)? Wow!!!

Throw in pogohopper to pull a ban. 
---
Also noone in their right mind would ban tess there :D. (Even if they don't see espionage they know it has to be a enemy class card creation card, so they ban that and give you a very weak 8 drop and no wincondition. 
---
But what does it do tho.

They weren't!

Instead of complaining about moderators who are doing nothing wrong, maybe try putting out content that *you* think is quality.
---
Plenty of cards have more or less infinite value, its just that there is no cost or restriction on spell cards unless stated in the text. Look at recent cards like pot of desires or pot of extravagance to see how powerful a draw 2 card in Yugioh is. 
---
"Excavate"? That's a thing? Yugioh is weird...
---
everything will change. impossible to tell.
---
Impressive
---
I'm so jaded... I would be like: "So... RNG."
---
Jaina, don't hurt me

---
Not randomly, when you bring the candle to it.
---
LITTUL KOBOLDS
---
Oh, really? I never knew that, my bad.
---
One. Jesus fucking wall of text.
---
Two. Nerfed cards are nerfed because they were too strong, that has nothing to do with wild or standard and doesn't address the issue at all. 
---
I never pass up a turn 1 espionage when I get it! It paid out and they conceded next turn, with my lethal on the board
---
Hmm, well see seems like the two cards we've gotten from shaman are slow end game powerful cards, not a shaman player myself but im jealous that swampqueen hagatha is shaman exclusive.. even if the flavor wouldn't make since. Such an awesome effect!
---
Throw in undatakah with Armor and board clear deathrattles!!
---
Pogo-Hopper for some value game.
---
Huh I always though Gonkâ€™s Mark was bad. Congrats.
---
Consider gold cards hearthstones equivalent of foil cards. 
---
Where's the shitty watercolor guy when you need him?
---
I use pogo hopper cuz I didnâ€™t think of a mill deck ðŸ˜‚
---
And Togwaggle is the "Heistbaron"
---
I only know about wonder balloons because of duel links. Basically discard any number of cards add a counter to wonder balloons. For each counter reduce your opponents monsters atk by 300. Discard 3 cards and they all have -900 atk. 
---
Which one is rush?
---
Sorry it's 1/5, 3 cost, taunt, magnetize, mech, common
---
Yeah ziliax prob better only advantage is dropping this taunt early vs the edwin / pogo decks
---
Here is the full [Decklist](https://imgur.com/HTatBbU)
---
I am aware of the card. During the pre-release event for the physical set it was is in, the card was played often as it was a common and made games awful because spell and trap removal is rarely designed at common.
---
Otherwise though, a "permanent" three hundred attack debuff is not worth losing a card even in decks that to dump cards into the graveyard.
---
Pretty much yeah. For a lot of instances, picture the card as a 0 mana reincarnate that doesn't activate deathrattle
---
&gt; a few people didn't even know how to play some of their decks. 
---
Yeah, that was also because of the format.
---
Think I need to download more ram
---
The fun is probably in winning and ranking up rather than having whatever hodge podge standard deck you make out of hopes and dreams gets farmed at rank 12 by endless odd paladins.
---
Its okay as a childrens show.
---
Not worth it for an adult.
---
Like a true Hunter
---
actually thats cool
---
I loved the broom from Karazhan but how do you get the volcano? I must test it out before it rotates
---
You're not going to get a conglomerate of Activision-Blizzard fans to agree on anything assuming the "Fans of Blizzard Holdings Company" even manages to attract enough funding to become a major investor in the first place.
---
For every person that takes their money out of the holdings company (be it because its arguing for something likely to decrease the value of their investment or simply isn't arguing for something they're passionate about), the weaker its standing among the other major shareholders will become until it ultimately becomes irrelevant.
---
Congrats! First time Legend is a great feeling, doing it in Wild is even better!
---
Oof. Sorc apprentice deserves a second star come on man 
---
\*Draws another Arcane Intellect\*  
---
Ok
---
It is lmao. But with double spirit its insane. Two free 3/2 at the start
---
Maybe not but it was still super fun to play with, and isnâ€™t that the point of tavern brawls. :)
---
I had an easy victory with the "spells cost less" shrine for Shaman.
---
As long as you draw Unstable Evolution, it's an easy win most of the time.
---
Of course, shit my happen and one boss actually managed to wipe my board full of high level minions but most of the time it's an easy victory.
---

One time it was crazy, I actually won a game!
---
I agree with the lifesteal one.
---
But your taunt line would create a lock if you controled multiple taunts, like Marauding Captain, Magicians Valkyria or Hand-Holding Genie in YuGiOh. I took the wording from Ring Of Magnetisms effect, which would still allow you to attack any taunt.
---
Just play odd paladin instead 
---
ASTOUNDING! 
---
I'm just hoping for a severe absence of Big Power Cards. No Spellstones. No Death Knights. No Tunnel Trogg. No Patches. No Keleseths. No other ludicrously overtuned crap. Just a nice low powerlevel, so people can actually play cards they enjoy without getting completely stomped by the 999 netdecks.
---
Nah it's just typical end of expansion stuff. Honestly this is more inspired and funny than usual.
---
NANI? 
---
The worst is eventually you realize this, but you still want to tell other people stories.
---
While the song is about conquering the city, it seems that each of them just wants something in it. A full on takeover? I doubt it. A successful raid to arcane vaults? Very likelly. 
---
You don't? I use them all the time with my friend who play hearthstone regularly. I use things like "I greet you" and "Hail, friend!" even on people I don't usually talk in English with. The more they talk about HS, the more I use them.
---
&gt; I always reply to someone's messages because if someone is going to go out of their way to reply to something I made or respond to me in general then it's only common courtesy to give them the time of day to reply. 
---
Well I guess I shouldn't be surprised to see yet more stupid logic.
---
&gt; Going out of your way to angrily comment to something someone posted is the petty thing.
---
I know, right?
---
So why did you do it?
---
Added you 
---
Neji#1812 (NA) 80g quest. I show, you go first
---
I will miss it so muchâ€¦   
---
After reading the comments, i'd like to give a few thoughts from a Rogue main  
---
When I come to think about what Rogue will lose  and what the other classes are going to lose, I am quite happy already.
---
Except for Kobolds &amp; Catacombs  (+Vilespine Slayer and the Quest they nerfed 3 times), these expansions were rather poor for Rogue.  
---
Witchwood, Boomsday and Rumble gave Rogue far more interesting cards for deck-building for three different types of decks: Thief, Deathrattle and Pirate.  
---
 Obviously, in its current state, Miracle Rogue will almost be unplayable if they do not give Rogue at least one OP card designed for Miracle.   
---
With Auctioneer staying in Standard, Blizzard's scepticism towards Rogue and the big rotation, I doubt it will happen with this expansion already, but probably with the second one.  
---
Add a lackey my foot!
---
And they are not alone, they have their lackeys and schemes
---
More like Turn 1
---
am i the only one mediumly infuriated that the cards are on the wrong sides?
---
You kinda helped him a bit tho. He was probably mechathun
---
Cool story bro
---
I thought I'll never see the day...
---
Yes, but when it does do I get an apology?
---
/golfclap 
---
How the hell is it stupid logic to reply to a person that replied to you, fuck sake brother that's called being a nice fucking human regardless of what you're talking about.
---
Regardless how stupid my initial post was, I gave you the same respect you gave me. A rude reply to a rude reply, seems fair to me. Sure I'm a petty, cynical fuck, but at least I can admit it, unlike you taking the higher ground for no reason.
---
2 and 2 my ass
---
Yep and I annihilated him xD they need the naturalize ;)
---
You know itâ€™s the end of an expansionâ€™s lifespan when a series of shitposts generate their own spin-off shitposts.
---
Yeah, this is the deck i was playing for houres, but i couldn't make it with it, thats Why i was asking

Hooktusk is great but I'm usually dead to pirate rogue way before turn 8 because of raiding party.
---
Why is this thread with 4 comments pinned and there's no pinned thread about this weeks awesome brawl? Really disappointing.
---
I think they programmed the darkness to be really trigger happy with removal spells. The best way to best him is to wait out all of his removal and take him to fatigue. Blizzard must have realized itd be nearly impossible if he used his removal properly.

So, I've been running Liam since this post and I've had a few opportunities to drop him but the results were always pretty unusable or unhelpful, until today.
---
Against a Wall Priest I was screamed and dropped Liam. I was able to put a Pyros down pretty quickly to generate some value. A few turns later I top-decked Glinda Crowskin which set up an echo play with a Fungalmancer. This allowed me to smash through his Mosh Ogg and set up a win.

Both your nerf and naturalize are quite rightfully justified by the power of  possessed lackey and hadronox respectively. Possessed lackey was nerfed for its minion-cheating ability, and dark pact was nerfed because it gave too much sustain. Naturalize was run to kill your hadronox; cube was run to kill hadronox. Nobody would naturalize their own cube unless they are desperate. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As powerful as cube can be, it's not that far above the power curve: it only seems overpowered because in order for it to be good, you need to build your entire deck around it; of course it will appear more powerful when most of your deck is designed to make it strong. No cube decks have been at the very top of the meta since possessed lackey was nerfed though, which clearly shows that cube itself isn't overpowered. 
---
That is art for Resurrect from Hearthstone

I hit one for 11 cards. I could hear something pop on the other end of the screen.

Idk about that glitch but a while back you could use demon pact on malchezar and instawin..thats how i finished the heroic karazhan
---
Coming from /programming to read different things like card games (I have not been played Heartstone for 3 years) because i really like the scene of middle tier players (not top neither normal like me).
---
What you say is really true thinking in it, in my daily job the most stress comes from reactions that are accompanied with assumptions, feelings, personal thoughts.
---
Decisions are more rational, objective not loaded of above elements, this create less friction on the flow.
---
And the true decisions can be wrong, with it come the secret that how much better you check your decisions, much better your take another that fix it, remember me fail-fast system design principle.

Thanks for sharing it, one question for you, exists others links that you and your friend find with it idea ?

Oh that's evil.
---
Nah, fixed, but can still work with the 8 cost card that cast a spell from your deck, problem is that it is random target and can miss malch for its minions
---
What a story, Mark
---
I do it when it's obvious  like i won't attack or just let them play out but thanks to a few bad expieriences I make sure I'm always in an advantages state. As a few times of let someone play all thier cards out and as a thank even though I could have won the game since like turn 12 they beat and BM me.
---
yeah, like DK Rexxar destroying control decks, so much fun.

Well while it is pretty cool that all generations can coexist on the internet, sometimes it leads to confusion if you see an upvoted post and you forget that there are thousands of children and teenagers here, and they clearly have a different understanding of quality content. 
---
Different generations are different, and that's okay but it does obviously have downsides. 
---
[https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_Missile](all darts strike simultaneously).  Itâ€™s different than WoW.
---
He's weak by himself in HS too. That's what the magnetic is for.
---
Why would you put yourself at a disadvantage?
---
I know you fiddled a load of stuff to try and get its stats similar to those on the card, but this would be cooler if you made it actually a cr 5 level monster IMO.
---
He is still played in Aluneth Mage, at least as of the last VS Wild report.  I still play him, and he seems worth including.
---
This got me thinking: I donâ€™t have Hallazeal, but I bet he could replace Lightning Bolt to good effect. The game would drag out for longer, but once youâ€™ve stabilized, the heal effects would put you out of reach. Then itâ€™s just a Hallazeal beat down. 
---
Deathrattle rogue is surprisingly really good. The huge swing turns with cube and necrium vial are hilarious

Itâ€™s not a disadvantage if you can keep track of your decks in your head.

This is the ideal male body. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.

Why is it called a Gypsy Priest though?

That seems like a really contrived and unnecessary step when you could just use a deck tracker

Iâ€™m pretty sure this is PvE.

The first deck is a beast, thanks mate ! 9 wins in a row right now
---
Magic Missiles is weird. It is 1 instance of damage but also multiple. One such case of this is that Magic Missile (1st level) forces 3 concentration checks on the recipient, because it is 3 instances of damage. https://twitter.com/jeremyecrawford/status/716012166101401600

One I've not seen mentioned is
---
* Ship's Cannon
---
* Sharkfin Fan
---
* Southsea Captain
---
* &lt;any 1 drop pirate&gt;
---
I like running the guy who gives you +1 attack when you equip a weapon, but the 2/1 charge dude is probably better.
---
Normally the Cannon or the Captain gets banned, and you just steamroll with the remaining cards. 
---
Interesting.  I guess Iâ€™ve been running this incorrectly.  TIL
---
from 4 different classes
---
I want shaman to be playable without like 8 legendaries. The class has a worse winrate than post nerf druid. Pls blizzard just give me some useable shaman decks in that 3k to 6k dust range.
---
But they see that in advance so they don't play the doomsayers. Can you goldfish a kill before turn 6 when they Spreading Plague? Even with them gaining 12 armor on turn 4? Obviously you still ban Naturalize because it still beats you just like it beats everything else.
---
Also, I was thinking about it and I don't see how that wins. Don't they just ban Academic Espionage? Which means you have to ban Naturalize. Then I don't think that Pogo hoppers beat Doomsayer + Spreading Plague and they are back to winning in fatigue with armor gain.
---
Rofl, anyway I think it could improve the screenshot easily because it's only 2 mana and you just throw the card in play right before you take it.
---
Not to nitpick, but SS would have probably been better if you moused over the burned cards in the action bar so everyone can see them burned there.
---
I've been playing a control/big spell mage with the goal combo of just playing Augmented Ellik with Deck of wonders multiple times, and letting the spells fly
---
Yeah that is one common card, less exploitable tho, i wonder what will be the go to replacement. Maybe a 3/4 for 3 with taunt and a negative death rattle
---
Shoulda got gud
---
Dab
---
I like the sound of that, but if they get rid of blood Knight the deck kinda dies.
---

Glow-Tron, Faithful Lumi, Bronze Gatekeeper, and Annoy-o-Module

Basically, you just build to biggest mech possible. I've haven't encountered any decks running single-target removal, and the deck can beast Hunter.
---
When is it ? 
---
yes, this is 'new' content and such a hilarious post too. \*yawn\*
---
this subreddit keeps proving time and time again that Hearthstone's main target audience are kids. I can't blame  blizzard though seeing the kids here gets easily amused by bandwagon shitposts such as this.
---
True. I was just like shocked at what happened and it was a panic screen shot haha. I mean you can tell they were burned because they show up in his decklist before he had the mana to play them but I get you. 
---
Its working properly. 
---
Only on mobile I think

missed that, thanks for the summary.

tl;dr: crescendo is alive, biscuit isn't. ^^sry

Counter point: people who flex on you when you're obviously playing to finish a quest.
---
You sure? Hand buff is suppose to work on both chain gangs right?
---
That's illegal.
---
Card text was changed. It was summon a copy, so it was buffed. Now it says summon a SCG, so a 2/3 minion
---
No, they changed it in order to nerf shudderwock

---
Giggling inventor at 5 mana was insane. 
---
I'd agree if not for the fact that Mage is one of the worst classes right now and the best Mage deck doesn't usually run Jaina. 
---
Control isn't around largely because of the strength of OTK decks like Mechat'thun and Gallery Priest alongside other various Priest decks, which are currently very popular because they do well against Hunter and also happen to do well against Control because they can generally stretch a huge amount of value (like summoning a Lich King upwards of six times a game) and/or because if they stick a threat with pretty much any stats you're dead because they can triple divine spirit and topsy it. 
---
The other half of the meta is Hunter, where you're right, Rexxar singlehandedly carries the game. 
---
Wow...
---
BTW whoever correctly names how I got the 40 health Garrosh gets free internet points
---
Rare cards aren't usually stronger because otherwise no new product would be sold (Unless you're talking about Yugioh). Rather, rare cards are made rare because they are more complex or at least unique, and more complex cards tend to be better than more common ones. 
---
Legendary cards are an exception to this rule in Hearthstone, but they come with a deck building restriction which allows them to be stronger than cards of other rarities.
---
So frustrating how people concede. Unless you're playing burn Mage "deal 65 damage to players" can take 5+ games. Conceding past turn 3 should award at least 20 damage. 
---
Man, it's a good thing that Blizzard never printed another massively overpwoered Taunt minion that literally everyone uses...
---
They just printed **Unity. Presicion.** ***PERFECTION.***
---
Hah excellent. I definitely went double digits in a row too XD. 
---
Better be a card this expansion
---
"THIS IS A MICROWAVE"
---
"Thank you Zilliax, it looks great"
---
"THIS IS A REFRIGERATOR"
---
"It looks like a winner, but I still feel like it's missing something"
---
*Zilliax merges into the fridge, becoming one*
---
"Wow that's awesome! What about this oven?"
---
"I CANNOT UNMAGNETIZE. I AM ZILLGERATOR NOW"
---
That second one is too strong however the first one dies to BGH so it will never see play.
---
I'm not entirely sure why you're being downvoted. Most websites (including Reddit) don't allow users under the age of 13 to use them in order to not have to deal with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.
---
I don't really have problems on wild Rank mode (rank 15-10) but I noticed that casual sometimes has people who rope or BM. If I get a roper in casual, I just concede and move to a better game. 
---
Tar Creeper was played in aggro, token, Zoo, control, midrange and elemental decks
---
Took me about 10m to see that shit
---
You suck my mum's dick? Sick bro.

the left blastmaster boom is good, but he's no right blastmaster boom
---
The obligatory, this is new treant missing art post
---
Magic missile is one that's much more open to that DM interpretation in my book. I'd probably rule in my games that I was fine with it happening sequentially, because that's what makes sense to me.
---
Especially since IIRC it wasn't an official errata or in the books that they all hit at once, but a sage advice by the dev saying that's what they intended at the time - but I'm pretty sure those have been overturned too :)
---
There are no 2 cost cards in your deck. They are in your hand dude.
---
Maybe if the bots had taunt it might see some play
---
At least the second isn't as shitty and swingy as blastmaster boom
---
actually keleseth is like Reno. it checks undrawn card so you can have cold bloods in hand and it would work.  it wouldn't trigger if still in deck.  
---
Hagatha is lvl 10 
---
Togwaggle is probably lvl 110
---
What
---
you never play jaraxxus yourself, you just have your opponent play it and you copy their hero power using sideshow spelleater
---
Or Firelord Nomi alone
---
Is that not a possum?
---
Don't forget that Priest can run Kabal Courier to search for Jaraxxus and Mage secrets, but that leaves us with either Rogue or Grimy Goons cards to find.
---
I thought it would kill the berserker based off the title, haha
---
Can someone explain this to me please 
---
The thing is, Hearthstone isn't based on WoW lore. Hearthstone is a card game in WoW, which is played in the Tavern. So, it makes sense that some cards are based on actual events, and others are complete fiction.
---

---
I want to, but I have a lab report due tonight that I've already been ignoring for too long posting this kind of stuff on reddit. I reckon getting this will take multiple hours to try and get all the right cards generated (especially since I don't have a lot of them)
---
That's not supposed to work. It's gotta be some combined bug with elixir AND cleric, cause I've used elixir one some other minion in arena before and twilight's call didn't resurrect it. 
---
Fair enough, if you are using  cards with that power level as example no wonder you made them like that. I was thinking of something more the likes of "maybe playable today" not "unplayable even in 2010"
---
A lot of those games were played to the bitter end. But yeah, haha, I get it.
---
If only the other guy was playing Mecha-Jaraxxus. We could get in on that Jaraxxus on Jaraxxus action
---
Some drafts are going to be bad and unfortunately there's nothing you can do about it. The system is set up to get players to spend more. Players with more resources will just retire poor decks and draft again and spend more of their gold or money which is obviously what Blizzard wants. If this isn't true  then why not just let everyone draft the same quality decks? Blizzard knows what cards are good as we can see with the bucket system so they could make the playing field more level if they wanted.
---
No prob dude, add me ihawaii1#1740 whenever you're less loaded down with work and ill gladly meme another time though
---
I got 9 cards. 1 from. Hand and deck went from 17 to 9. Feels good man, turn 5!

Anytime you pull Tirion that's a jackpot in its own right, but you didn't hit the jack pot in terms of both cards. Those two cards don't synergize well together, and it's a very rare scenario where you are going to be able to play both and get value out of each of them. 
---
How is he untargetable and immune? 
---
Final boss of HS.
---
An even more effective combo is Priest with Power Word: Glory. Granted they could just ban PW: Glory, but if they don't you win very easily, and people rarely ban it if you put in Mind Blast.
---
What about the golden Gruul, the King of goons?
---
You could have had more than 2 deathrattle minions in your resurrect pool. Unless you didnâ€™t in which case ignore me.
---
And yet League of Explorers is heralded by most to be the best set ever and hasn't really been based much on Wow. 
---
you're aware of the new expansion; did you not know about old cards rotating out at the same time? The cards are at the end of their standard rotation so will be moved to wild in April and this has been openly planned since the cards came out 2 years ago. If you weren't aware and just spent loads of dust on rotating cards then that sucks :(
---
I donâ€™t see whatâ€™s goin-
---
TURN ONE
---
you mean buff, the biggest problem with the left blastmaster boom is it dies to BGH. Maybe if the boombots had taunt it might see play, 2/5 stars.
---
&gt; Tar Creeper was played in *some* aggro, token, Zoo, control, midrange and elemental decks
---
It seems like no one remembers 5 mana giggling. Literally every deck was made better with it
---
Yes, Hakkar deathrattle would trigger after the end of the game.
---
Congrats, you're only the \*\*SEVENTH\*\* person to post this exact same clip
---
I still like Holy Wrath Paladin. It's not as powerful as it was before the nerfs, but you can still win a lot with it. If they don't print some crazy armor gain cards, it should actually survive rotation, so that's nice.
---
Fair point. Let's see some magician of black chaos and blue eyes shining dragons then! Xyz's would make good as mech I imagine
---
Yeah, that factor, while mostly true, mostly falls apart considering how top-heavy Yugioh gets, and Hearthstone has very few minions above 8/8. So mathematically, most Hearthstone minions using a similar factor would get wiped out by a normal, old school 4 star 1900 atk minion.
---
When I [designed my Nzoth](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/b4gylr/heres_nzoth_the_corruptor_as_a_yugioh_card/), I realized that 1700 atk would be really silly, but since 5/7 is still a pretty low  stat line for a 10 mana, I went for completely arbitrary numbers that were closer to 2500ish. (2400/2800) 
---
Whoa. Yeah, that makes this clip even crazier.
---

---
O M G NICE
---
Sometimes I do my quests in casual and since I only use that mode for quests I can't complete in standard (like play as a priest), my MMR puts me vs relatively bad decks often (though I also face net decks every 1/4 games or so).  When I see people playing really janky home made decks but I can tell they want them to work so bad, I pretend I am trying to beat them but hold off on playing good cards or make "mistakes" so they can just barely beat me.  It is worth it seeing them drop cards really fast and go for lethal with some crazy home made deck that they usually lose with, betting that they are thinking "hey my deck actually works!".  
---
If you don't die when you play Bloodreaver you win, the hero power is so oppressively powerful compared to all other hero powers, unconditional 3 damage lifesteal that can target face is worth easily 3-4 mana, for two mana and having unlimited uses makes most decks unable to contest it. 
---
The hero power is too strong to compete with for most decks, the fact that void lord made playing the card insanely safe is problematic, and the ability to cheat out voidlords cheap and early breaks a lot, but the card itself is problematic for it's own reasons.
---
