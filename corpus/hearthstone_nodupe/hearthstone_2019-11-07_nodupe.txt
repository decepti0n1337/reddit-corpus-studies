---
Agreed, also spells somehow. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll add more
---
Though you definitely seem to have a more negative opinion on this game mode than I do, I find myself agreeing with many of the points you are making.
---
The main issue for me is the level of RNG. As you rightly mentioned, the hero(?) you play is not really your choice, but basically "Discover a random hero". Then you get to buy minions that are randomly generated, and yeah you can reroll a bunch of times in an effort to find the ones that will work for you, but it is a bit of a crapshoot nonetheless. Worst of all is the fact that minions attack randomly. (I saw someone call it a "Mass Hysteria Simulator that respects taunts" and boy is that painfully accurate. I feel like I'm constantly just playing dice in every stage of this game mode, hoping to roll whatever constitutes a good number for me. I recognize randomness is part of a lot of card games, but in this particular game mode it is excessive.
---
Honestly, regular Hearthstone has lately had too high of an RNG factor for my taste already. But at least I can build my own deck the way I want to so I have a certain feeling of agency, and I feel somewhat in control of the game, but in this Battlegrounds mode I lack even that.
---
One spark of hope I do see is things like that Zap card, whatever it is called, that attacks the lowest attack minion. It is a rare moment of being able to influence what my minions do (besides taunt) that made combat ever so slightly more interesting. If there is opportunity to strategize a bit more besides the "make a giant poisonous divine shield taunt" or "all of the amalgams" this game mode might become a bit more interesting.
---
How many meta decks can u play? And u have no missing cards for the meta decks? Are u f2p? If u r how?
---
It's 100% by design. Hearthstone has always focused on making elegant and simple card designs rather than complex ones. It's a tradeoff that keeps the game easy to get into/get back into rather than giving the game much depth (although the game has certainly gotten better at getting more complexity into card design in recent years). This type of design makes it so that no card takes particularly long to understand at a glance, which is a level of accessibility most other ccgs don't have. I'm not digging on complex games like MTG, they certainly have their place, it's just not what I think HS is going for.
---
Yup
---
It allows them into the auto battler space without devoting too many resources to making a new game altogether. A HotS auto battler could‚Äôve been more fleshed out but it wouldn‚Äôt have been ready so soon. They‚Äôre shoving a round peg into a square hole with this one and it kinda fits but it‚Äôs not perfect. I‚Äôm enjoying it and I‚Äôm excited to see how they support this moving forward.
---
This patch I can't even reroll quests at all.
---
Search function.
---
I am not good at this mode. Then again I only tried three times and managed 4th the last time, but I feel like I am making terrible decisions. You probably need to play this mode several dozen times to get a good feel which is rather time consuming.
---
It sounds like something Blizzard would do
---
Not always the case. There are multiple reason for a crash but in blizzard case probably said we just wont let it open at all.
---
Pay to beta test for them and then they fuck over their regular game in the process.  
---
I'm fast losing even more  faith in these clowns.
---
...The player numbers have consistently dropped since beta, Witchwood was the start of a steeper drop which is still continuing.
---
There was a second part of that. He is LUCKY. People are NOT exaggerating. Us people that aren‚Äôt having these problems want to know exactly how bad it is. Is mobile literally unplayable for the majority? Or just a small handful of people?
---
Fuck that noise. I reroll any quest that I don't want to do. No matter the reward or how easy it is.
---
Dammit you got me, also you‚Äôre quick
---
well with that mindset i'm gonna go for it, is just money that im gonna waste in another game, so im gonna take the risk, and if i regret the preorder, i'm just not gonna pre order again like u say
---
Then it means it's a problem with phone compatability most likely.  
---
Software is complex and complicated
---
It would make too much sense to give us the option after 5 years of asking for it. They never will.
---
Better late than never?  
---
Won't matter with their spray and pray overly powerful expansion anyway.
---
Exactly what I'm doing

Check ur mail dawg
---
Battlecry: Give a friendly minion "Inspire: Add a random spell to your hand. Give it echo."
---
Imagine the clusterfuck in current wording this would be.
---
Combo will be:
---
‚Ä¢Play Jepetto for a 1 mana Malygos + Sathrovarr. 
---
‚Ä¢Play the Malygos next turn, then play Sathrovarr on the Malygos to get a second Malygos on board and in hand. 
---
‚Ä¢Then play Eureka for the third Malygos. Ez +15 spell damage on board.
---
You still have 2 mana left for the damage spells. Fire away.
---
In other words the same as almost every other game in existence. There is always a steady but slight trend downward in the player base.
---
I will never understand their logic. Probably because there is none.  
---
\*and if there is a hidden meaning, it most likely has to do with $$$
---
There are 3 legendary quests coming that will give you DoD packs and u could get packs by pre-ordering as well
---
Thank you sir
---
Are you confused because Undatakah didn't die? Otherwise I'm confused.
---
Eh, secret mage is really good but it‚Äôs beatable. Wild has always had decks like that, and besides it keeps things like sniplock and big priest in check
---
I think it's more why didn't effigy trigger with the Annoy-o-bot.
---
I know it‚Äôs a joke but this could still actually be a nerf (not a great one though) depending on the current pool of 8s and 9s in standard. 
---
I don‚Äôt want to check the 9s in standard right now but traditionally they have been weaker than the 8s
---
I have been running 3-5 streams consecutively most of yesterday and today....nothing
---
how is this not like mountain giant where you can drop an 8/8 onto the board on turn 4 as a warlock
---
Oh, yeah, that's really weird. 
---
Then again we can just throw that in the pile of spaghetti code that resulted from the last update.
---
1. freehongkong comment didnt even criticize him. ur apologizing hard for him.

2. again, comments deleted by him wat the fuck you talking about? seriously? you now seem like just argue for the sake of arguing.

3. so in your opinion calling a person moron is way pleasant than saying your mentality is exactly like the chinese who cheered for injustice act which no a single word of personal attack has been used? just wow. wow.
---
Wait you got 2 dailies? I didn't lol.
---
\[\[Scargilll\]\] alone ruins the brawl for me. The first person who plays this and the opponent doesn't have an answer straight up wins the game. How fun it is to not be able to deal with what's essentially a 4-Mana \[\[Avianna\]\].

This is one that I've heard from others as well. Will add it up above!

They have nothing to do w your freedom of speech you can say whatever if you post on their page unfortunately they can do what they want stop bitching and stop supporting them then
---
(1) The heroes lose in Ice Crown but villains got more then they asked for - Dec 2019 Expansion
---
(2) All the heroes and villains 'die' and gets sent into the Shadowlands - April 2020 Expansion
---
(3) They come back and go on a legendary artifact hunt to kill the boss - Aug 2020 Expansion
---
(4) The final all-in expansion to close the story arch - Dec 2020 Expansion
---
exactly, jesus fucking christ, its a free to play game, people need to get over shit like this. Shit happens.
---
Call it a coincidence, good/bad timing, or just me lying.. but I've had a hankering for some HS lately and happened to come back just a few days before the dragon expansion was announced.
---
Haven't played in ages, since the Raza priest nerf that I last bitched about May of last year (check the profile). Had some fun in wild lately though. Still have my 12k gold and a couple grand in dust I figured maybe I'd preorder to get the bonus packs, a bit more dust, and this new game mode a bit early. 
---
You can count me outta that after this crap shoot of an update. Truly, truly doesn't seem like they did *any* proper QA. I can't like I know my ass from my elbow when it comes to the complexity of the code for this game but surely a company of this size has some algorithms to make sure their keywords, squelch, and even multi-platform loading of the game checks out just fine.
---
I hate it though man. I watch the HS streamers that have stuck around (Zalae and Tylerootd are my favorite) and can't argue that the multitude of digital card games released over the years consistently fail to overtake Hearthstone. I love the UI, the cards, the art, the SFX, the background music, and the complexity of (some of) the games. 
---
But how could I support this? $50 isn't pocket change regardless of if I'll piss it away on booze, food, or whatever else.
---
Try billions
---
u/Chris_Attalus small indie company right? Fuck the majority of your players for weeks!
---
That‚Äôs weird. Tirion should look more like a frog or sheep right?
---
There's would have more or less trolls. A troll is a troll and it has nothing to do with UI design.
---
aye, same. glad I'm not alone on it at least
---
Except these are the first "inspire" cards they've made in 4 years....
---
so have you tried to post a comment and see for yourself? if not, why questioned? and pls enlighten me which rule justifies that comparing his mindset to those chinese who agreed with injustice is a violation? also which rule says that "mod has been censoring" is a violation too?
---
What is this obsession with "sticking it to new players" over a keyword that hasn't been in standard for years and wasn't even fun when it was around...
---
Sure, shit happens. But if their game isn't working as intended for a week or more, I don't think it's crazy to give out a couple packs to people for the inconvenience. It would make most people very happy.
---
The comment you wrote said the Chinese are mentally corrupted. The comparison then means you called the mods mentally corrupted. That is an insult in it of itself.
---
&gt;so have you tried to post a comment and see for yourself?
---
Why would I do that? I'm not gonna' troll a thread just to see if some guy making a claim with zero evidence is telling the truth.
---
&gt;pls enlighten me which rule justifies that comparing his mindset to those chinese who agreed with injustice is a violation? also which rule says that "mod has been censoring" is a violation too?
---
Share your original comments and we'll see which rules, if any, you broke. I'm just going with the most logical conclusion here rather than immediately believing your conspiracy theory.
---
*a few weeks later*
---
Wait, what's hongkong?
---
Tons of cards have battlecries, deathrattles, every set has some new keywords that casual players have to figure out. There‚Äôs no reason not to utilize keywords for effects. Especially in a digital game with reminder text that appears when you hover over the card.
---
Between this and Iksar/Firebat‚Äôs comments I think they want standard to be terrible for another month so that people play Battlegrounds.
---
And so will essentially every Battlegrounds player. I don't understand what population of people you think are not going to have twenty packs week one. Even a player with zero gold saved up will get half that in free day one packs.
---
Ehh.. not enough funds to implement this everywhere i guesd
---
Most secret mages. Quit strong
---
Why not give some free packs for next expansion Blizzard? Geez!
---
They haven't made a *single* card that triggers on hero power use since The Grand Tournament. They had your exact thought in TGT, made the entire set hero-power-centric, and the result was one of the least-liked expansions in the game's history. They weren't holding off because they didn't want to reuse the keyword, they were holding off because triggering off hero power use doesn't lead to a large number of good designs.
---
We all have our own personal aspects we like the most about the game and want to see more of, and we're all also very quick to call into question the developer's decisions, but I'm gonna go ahead and defer to their expertise on a choice to completely avoid a potential design direction year after year.
---
It's a free legendary of your choice
---
Should be when we get the next expansion If I'm not mistaken. If you arent enjoying hearthstone atm, take a break, will make the new expansion experience more fun.
---
"When this attacks and destroys a minion with damage exceeding that minion's current health, **Discover** a buff from a set of ten pre-selected bonuses."
---
versus
---
"**Overkill: Adapt**"
---
How about a timer that's only shown to the non-active player, so they can actually count the seconds their opponent has left? Maybe even show a reverse-counter, to show how long the opponent has gone over the time limit? This would provide useful information without giving trolls the ability to min-max
---
I saw a dude with two of the feeling that get stronger when you play a demon that were both 60/60s. No idea how he got that lucky. Also had a dude with a 24/40 taunt poisonous murloc.

Because in battlegrounds you can't end your turn. The end of turn button would be difficult to display when you also have this timer i guess.

The difference is that a minion hits the board while a spell is either in your hand or has been cast. If there was some kind of evolve mechanic for minions in your hand then it would likely work the same way.
---
If it wasn't clear, China has had fatigue/addiction protection measures for minors for decades, in every single game currently being played right now (including Hearthstone obviously).
---
If kids (especially below 13) play beyond like the third hour, nothing they do in-game registers. Stars don't count, they don't get gold, even say completing single player stuff like heroic Tombs of Terror card backs don't count. As you grow older the limit is gradually lifted. And yes every game requires a valid ID to be tied to your account.
---
They've also been circumventing this for ages with their parents/uncles/aunts' accounts, so I expect that to continue.
---
It's ironic that the guy whose username is Popsychblog seems to spend all his time playing Hearthstone and then writing long essays on Reddit complaining about Hearthstone.
---
Seems like he should analyze himself to figure out what's wrong because that doesn't seem healthy. Like just stop playing the game, it's not hard.

Because until we had it we never knew we couldn‚Äôt live without it.

The type of person who spends 4.5k on card packs is probably the same type who throws money at RGB ram.

While that may be true, to my understanding the Zayle decks haven't been updated at all, Whizbang updates every new expansion.
---
They share the same feature of giving you a deck, but are differentiated by just what decks they give you
---
Up till a few expansions ago, the game had always been  stable.  It‚Äôs really ruining my appetite that I can‚Äôt play on my phone during my break at work.  It‚Äôs been this way more often than not for a long time now.  I‚Äôm still playing at home, but I think it‚Äôs approaching the time where the game has run its course for me.  I am having some buyer‚Äôs remorse for pre-ordering for the first time.  If i hadn‚Äôt done that, I might not play out this next expansion.  They promised fixes for the mobile issues, but now it‚Äôs even worse.  I think if it‚Äôs not rock solid by the time the next expansion comes out, I will probably retire.  I‚Äôve had tons of fun in the game for a long time, but it‚Äôs just so sloppy now.
---
It's a 5/5 which gives +5/+5 to any beast summoned.
---
So all of those might be changing to 4
---
Because it was funny. It was never supposed to be too hard to beat it with one class, the real challenge was beating it with nine. And if you could beat it with eight, you could beat it with nine. So why not have some dub with things?
---
Priest being chosen in particular was probably semi-arbitrary because they had great specific ideas for some classes, and less great, less specific ideas for other classes.

&gt;*You are just like the mainland chinese who cant even take criticsim of your corrupted mentality.* 
---
If this sentence were properly constructed, which is isn't (there should be a comma before the "who" and "your" should be "their"), the reader would get out the following: mods = Chinese = Mentally corrupted.
---
As it is right now though, it maybe reads like the Chinese cannot take criticism of the mods' mental corruption, which is just strange.
---
Granted, the grammatical errors could also be purposeful, so you can say it means whatever you want it to and play gotcha forever.

This is a user interface mockup of what we have (all?) been waiting 5 years for - a way to upgrade existing cards we own to golden versions.
---
Instead of an empty button on the right, a new button "Golden Upgrade" is available to give us the sweet shinies at the arcane dust difference that is fair to both Blizzard and the players:
---
\* 360 dust (400 minus 40) to convert a Common to a golden.
---
\* 700 dust (800 minus 100) to convert a Rare to a golden.
---
\* 1200 dust (1600 minus 400) to convert an Epic to a golden.
---
\* 1600 dust (3200 minus 1600) to convert a Legendary to a golden.
---
It wouldn't cost you anything Blizz. Please show the players that you can be fair with the dust economy.

It‚Äôs ok, they made sure that he sucks by making bad recipe decks.

---
Or for Summonig Portal. I mean, it literally does say it on the card that it doesn't reduce cost less than 1. It's weird that it still "stacks" with reduction effects like Mechwarper, but they could tweak it if they really wanted to.

That happened to me yesterday, it solved itself by repeatedly entering and exiting the edit deck option.

---
&gt; I sure as hell wouldn't want the government (any government, let alone the CCP) telling me how I could or couldn't raise my children
---
You make it too straightforward: by fact, there are several parties involved. Let me just demonstrate it by a single example.
---
- Say, I do not want my abstract kids to own a smartphone until they are 16. This is understandable because modern smartphones are, literally, useless dashboards with ads you pay for.
---
- My kids are visiting a high school where most or every other student possesses an iPhone.
---
- As a result, my kids have difficulties socializing because, well, they do not have an iPhone.
---
- I have to make a choice and to risk my child's future: either I present an iPhone risking my child's school performance or I do not buy it risking my child's networking.
---
- Another choice is to change the high school to some other one where, for example, strict rules regarding the usage of smartphones during classes apply. **I.e. the only safe way out is to have a third party regulating this point for everyone.**
---
Pretty much the same story applies to games and HS in particular: they are designed to be addictive. Majority rules do not apply here: if a single kid with "bad" parents starts playing it at school, most other kids will tend to follow regardless of how good their parents are. And having a third party which regulates this is *directly* beneficial and only *potentially* harmful.
---
Their reason was not just China but general political issues yet the white kids had a political message too which is the racism.  Multiple white kids political no punishment, one Asian kid let‚Äôs go HAM
---
sexism was assumed on my part as they were biased on all other angles so I‚Äôll give you that‚Äôs unfounded
---
They're controlling what peiple can do in their free time, the end result is likely good but at the cost of taking away peoples freedom. 
---
That's what I meant with my comment which was a bit poorly worded. It's a question of if the ends justify the means.
---
"Sir, what is your connection with the Chinese government?"

I miss the days of people spamming "Sorry"

it is cheaper than it is currently (assuming u got the non-golden legendary out of a pack or something)
---
Same, but for this thread.
---
Some players are such snowflakes and read that as you insulting them than actually saying "well played" as intended.
---
If I had to recomend any warrior deck in wild I'd say pirate warrior. There are probably still decklists to be found on the internet.

No I don't but I've written something about my thoughts here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dsep3k/turns\_out\_firing\_all\_that\_qa\_during\_layoffs\_when/f6sa8nt?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dsep3k/turns_out_firing_all_that_qa_during_layoffs_when/f6sa8nt?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Rip lmao
---
shhh
---
&gt; then you're clearly reading way more into what I said than what I actually said. 
---
Quite the opposite.
---
What you said meant way more than you intended.
---
&gt; Is that clear enough?
---
Yup.
---
That's way better and much more agreeable.
---
Murloc/Evolve Shaman, Combo Priest and Tempo Rogue are some of the best Standard decks and can be built fairly cheaply.
---
There's a mini rotation upcoming with the next expansion (29 days from now)
---
Wait with crafting
---
it's galakrond cmon poor dude is already ugly as hell, saying the name like this is just cruel
---
Anytime it shows missing cards i go to editor enter deck and leave..now it can.ve used
---
They should introduce like a Whizbang ticket and use it like a season pass. make it craftable and purchaseable and not able to be disenchanted and rotate every year/two years.
---
Lowering crime rate as a lot of criminals are repeat offenders, not saying that it's something to wish for, just giving an overly exagerated comparison which sounded better in my head.
---
It's all hypothetical outside of China anyway. But check back to my original comment in response to czhihong. It's far more general than restricting game time. I even acknowledge that if it gets to a point where you "have to" restrict game time, maybe you should be making more of an effort to intervene?
---
Like I said, it's an interesting topic. As far as gaming is concerned, there are still specifics you could sift through.
---
As for the 'actual' context in China, yes. A lot of kids game too much. That's half the reason these things come up to begin with.
---
But of course there are a plethora of discussions you can have: what makes it 'too much,' what is the benefit of regulation, how should it be regulated, should regulation rules be instigated/implemented by parents (not that that would happen in China), etc. etc. etc.
---
It's multi-faceted and I see the merit in why you would do these things, even if ultimately I don't agree with it. That's what makes it interesting to me.
---
Why is this not called, "Silence, Healer"?
---
I remember someone posted on Reddit with 100k+ gold.
---
Shut up boomer
---
Wasn't it already 3 years old in 2016?
---
You‚Äôd be a fuul
---
In the same boat.  I had some extra money around the beginning of October and wanted to buy the Doom in the Tomb bundles, but after the Hong Kong fiasco I decided I didn't want to reward Blizzard.  Now Battlegrounds looks interesting, but the Descent cards revealed so far look like a broken mess, and the code is literally a broken mess, so I won't be preordering.
---
I'm dropping an unstoppable BM as we speak.
---
&gt; how significant regulation or outright control over the upbringing of a child, especially if it overrules bad parenting, can be.
---
You can't regulate someone into being a good parent. Parents who let their kids play video games all day won't now have them go outside and socialize. They just stick them in front of the TV.
---
Mine is small enough that it‚Äôs not noticeable and the alternative is trying to cram it into a front pocket along with knife, keys, and whatever other miscellaneous crap I have in my pockets.
---
The reason why people don‚Äôt notice it is that they were conditioned to ignore it since they were 13 and started carrying one.
---
And the Demon Hunter one?
---
Using Commanding Shout after playing Deathwing for extra BM points.

Nice.

.... because Anduin is an annoying little prick.
---
:(
---
Then why every other Autobattle game is FREE and this one should not? Are you mentally retarded or something?
---
I could see blizzard doing this as a once a year limited promotion.  It puts the pressure on the players that are dolphins to spend like a whale when they ordinarily wouldn‚Äôt
---
The flair says "competitive" but the idea says "humour"
---
Sure, something is better than nothing?
---
this would be good; a similar change would be to somehow allow the players to choose their end of month rewards so rather than get random cards they don't want they get the goldens that they actually are interested in. make it so not just the whales can afford goldens
---
Not in the current version of the game. The community manager says it'll be fixed next week Monday or Tuesday.

Not even close. And you payed 100g to get in.
---
Didnt knew that before it was mentioned, being mean just for being mean, that's outrageous ;)
---
What does it look like when you own one copy of a non legendary?
---
Also, if you choose to DE the upgraded golden, are you thinking of DE to non golden?
---
And how does blizzard handle that in their accounting system?
---
I feel sorry for what you have encountered. But mine have never crashed in iOS devices. (There are bugs like cannot type in with keyboard and missing cards in deck for the first time i login and Squelching indeed )  however, the game itself is just fine. It is not broken for me. All other problems you mentioned , they never appear in my devices. I believe it is all about the new engine.
---
They also need to nerf priest
---
the OG silence priest was classic/naxxramas silence priest with ancient watcher (and deathlord, + dark cultist) wasnt that good, but it was the original.
---
Hence "even outright control."
---
I.e. taking the child out of the bad parent's hands entirely.
---
Not that I'd be supportive of such a thing unless it is extreme circumstances - abuse, drugs, violence - nothing like "letting kids play too much on the Xbox."
---
Though I will say that too much game time can hint towards neglect, lack of stimulation, or "using a screen to parent." But that's a hint, not a rule, and for the most part I think kids just like to play video games. So it's far from enough to act on.
---
Yep, keep the ideas coming!
---
Non infinite shudderwork is a really cool and fun card, why the hate?
---
I mean, the quest to fight the Dread Raven was in the middle of the Arakkoa Dungeon, but no. It's a ground only mount from the expansion that added flying mounts.
---
Bugged
---
You have no way to steal the card other than turn 1 mind vision.
---
That's not really a CCG then, if you're not collecting things. 
---
I mean one might argue Hearthsotne isn't a CCG either as you can't actually sell your collection but.
---
my FTP alt got one of those new quests.  Something like "50 gold for playing 3 games as Druid, Hunter or Paladin" -- just play the games, you don't have to win them.  seems easy enough, but I'm not sure why they couldn't just added the quests &amp; kept the old ones too
---
Any deck with a win rate of 40% or lower is okay and not disgusting.
---
Good idea that‚Äôs how Mythgard does it.
---
I have said it and i will say it again, AAA games retail for 60 ish on steam and if i spend 60 bucks on an expansion, i will expect to get the full set of cards, not "a chance to build my favorite deck". Unless they change their stance i will not spend a penny on hs anymore.
---
*waves hands* these are not the droids you‚Äôre looking for.
---
seriously though, they make $20M+ in profit a MONTH from Hearthstone. I‚Äôm sure they can figure out these details..
---
Maybe, idk. I was referencing the ‚ÄúBen Brode please don‚Äôt take my deckslots ‚Äù meme.
---
What is the purpose of goldens? Whenever I get one from a pack I usually just dust it, and spend that on cards that I need. Until you‚Äôve got nearly a full set why would you ever spend dust on goldens?
---
Its definitely competitive. Clearing all enemies with 12 or less health (pretty much everything) and forcing all enemies who can ping to spend at least 2 mana next turn to deal with a 12/1. You also draw a card.
---
I dont think it's that good in warrior considering they have premium removal and good card draw cards, but at the very least its viable.
---
Feels sooo good beating Secret Mages. Most of them have no idea what they're doing, just vomit cards. Sadly, it works a lot of the time.
---
Actually it will work if played in proper order.
---
Imagine living in a downstairs apartment and your upstairs neighbors have triplet toddlers that are all hyperactive, are not medicated, disciplined, or taken anywhere to burn their energy.
---
Don't think so I k.o'd timeless** the currently number one player and also won the b.g. And only got 60. Game after that came seccond don't think I did a k.o and got 75.
---
How much would arena cost then? Right now you pay 150 and get 5 cards. Think how much they would charge to give you 30 cards and let you choose which ones you get.
---
this isn‚Äôt a very good combo even when played correctly because many classes can easily deal with that 12/1 after it attacks everything, and this is a two card combo.
---
Second situation: your opponent doesn‚Äôt have very many/very high attack minions on board and commanding shout is useless since deathwing would not be reduced below 1 hp anyway.
---
That's stupid! If I get lucky and draw a legendary it wouldn't want it to be a duplicate. I can decide whether I want to keep it or dust it. And honestly I don't care about Golden cards. It makes me much happier if I draw a new legendary which is saving me a lot of dust!!
---
No, "100% of players son't start from scratch" would mean that.
---
They would have to redesign some stuff. A normal magic deck consists of 60 cards, but at drafts you paid for 3 booster packs and made a deck of 30, or 40, can‚Äôt remember exactly
---
i think they should make golden cards have a small bonus or something so it's worth getting. I think +1 attack or -1 less mana to cast or something
---
&gt;Forcing you to buy packs for a game mode nobody wants to play anymore because it's been stale for YEARS and getting worse.
---
Wrong. It's not "buy 20 packs," its OPEN 20 packs. Huge difference. Last expansion, we got 11 free SoU packs over the first few weeks after release, so you realistically only need to open an additional ~9 packs. So you need to save up around 900 gold every 4 months in order to play with no handicap.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
You're actually bitching about that? This subreddit is honestly comical.
---
Squelch'd
---
It‚Äôs not like I said I was good at hearthstone. I barely play the game. It‚Äôs just a bitch post about a game that was over before it began
---
Thanks i actually didn't know that i'm gonna try warrior once the new set comes out
---
Are the Android issues being fixed related to crashing only?  My personal problem is that the game freezes randomly; it doesn't crash (I don't get kicked out of the app), but it freezes and causes me to have to force-restart the app (which is worse, because it takes more time, and it's harder to detect visually).
---
Also, any news on when we will have a functional reconnect feature?  Since you guys "improved" the reconnect experience on mobile it's been atrocious.
---
Golden Coin gives 2 Mana.
---
This is a grandslam for HS.
---
It‚Äôs very entertaining to stream and it‚Äôs almost 100% free to play. They will continue to refine it and it will just get even better.
---
AND, this game now introduces another ‚Äúcycle‚Äú to the game, and we really do love cycles.....
---
Card reveal season hype, expansion hype, arena rotation hype, balance changes hype, this adds a whole new category.
---
New/replacement Battleground minions and heroes reveal season will be more hype. 
---
BG exclusive keywords? More BG exclusive minions? Rewards? Hero portraits? Potential is endless.
---
It‚Äôs really important because it allows them to stagger yet another thing with Expansions, Single Player, and now BG - keeping players engaged almost constantly.
---
This is going to carry Hearthstone for a long time.
---
Mage isn't even that good bruh, you just salty man
---
These guys are slow as molasses to realize and act on their mistakes
---
They will defend the games 'balance' to the bitter end. There is no hope in trying to sway their opinions. Their minds are already made up.
---
 Are you suggesting Hearthstone changes the rules of their game so that they can give you more cards? Why would they do that?
---
Hey now, you don‚Äôt know that updating the flashy new game mode will take dev time away from regular HS.
---
If that were true, wouldn‚Äôt we be seeing the base game degenerate into messes of bugs that take weeks to get patched, and an anti-fun meta dominated by clearly unbalanced cards oh no.
---
Well, it would be far, far more expensive to enter (a fair price would probably be at least one thousand gold ), and the act of drafting itself would be pulled into two different directions: one where you pick the best card for the draft deck and one where you pick the card you really need to build a deck.
---
The current arena design was chosen specifically so players would only have to worry about drafting the best deck possible, not be torn between the choice of a legendary card they really want to play in constructed and the legendary card that's actually good in Arena.
---
It sounds like you‚Äôre salty. I‚Äôve climbed ladder pretty easily with a homebrew control pally. If you‚Äôre losing to the same decks - either change your deck or change your strategy.
---
I mean, you can grab all three, then upgrade your tavern to tier 2/3, *then* play it for a free tier 3/4 minion. It‚Äôs like another way to play A. F. Kay!
---
Still, with the amount of gold you‚Äôd be spending on minions and upgrades, it would be a fair bit slower than A. F. Kay. The three minions cost 9 gold and the upgrade(s) cost 4/~10 gold, meaning you wouldn‚Äôt be able to purchase all of this until like round 4 at the earliest. 
---
...yeah, you should just play AFK.
---
I sold my PC to buy a phone
---
Next time you can just fly your own plane instead?
---
Mage is barely played and isn‚Äôt that good rn lol
---
I've also been getting the same. And since I'm an extremely new player (47), I'm not familiar with what types of cards are or aren't allowed in ranked mode.
---
"Hallow‚Äôs End Arena Daily Quest can now be completed"
---
I completed this Quest but it was stuck in the Quest pool screen, so i had to reroll it. Am i gonna get the Gold still?
---
Please tell me this is a joke post.
---
Its open 20 packs, not buy 20 packs. We got about 11 free SoU packs last expansion release, so you only need buy another 9 packs with gold every 4 months.
---
The consumers feedback is useless.
---
Maly druid. Otk pally. Mech lock. Mech war.

Could it be because he killed himself with a card like \[\[Vulgar Homunculus\]\] during the preparation?
---
I do love it overall but I do have complaints with some of the broken meta decks.   When Blizzard says ‚Äúfun over balance‚Äù I understand and agree with that logic but it should really apply to how fun it is to play AGAINST as well.  I couldnt stand fighting big rez priest for example. Now wth n‚Äôzoth etc.. I dont think the ‚Äúfun‚Äù the user is having is a + as much as my hate for playing against it is a -

---
Who even plays flamestrike in a competitive deck?
---
All my decks were invalid... but if I remove the cards and put them back in its fine
---
So I think this deck has to be played very fast to win in this meta.  Might need to play van cleef earlier for tempo because later on he‚Äôs just too easy to clear no matter how big he is.  Might consider swapping questing adventurer for something that impacts the board the turn it‚Äôs played.  This deck isn‚Äôt super strong right now overall.  Have you tried nzoth?
---
This is unnecessary since golden cards are dumb and for whales.
---
Auchenai value
---
I suspect Natalie is behind this in some way.
---
I'll probably get eviscerated for suggesting this, but I think there's merit in bringing back Baku/Genn in March next year for a month. It'll be right before rotation so it doesn't impact too much but it'll give us a snapshot and what the meta could have been like.
---
It's how I did it since I started playing shortly after tombs of terror came out.
---
I've introduced a couple people to HS from other CCGs like Gwent and stuff, when they saw you get 3 gold per win they were like, this is unplayable. And I agree.  Also legendaries should cost 800 dust to craft not 1600.  But blizz is absolute trash at monetizing cosmetics and instead only focuses on p2w or pay to have fun with diverse decks.
---
Lansky#2353 EU 80g trade. I can show first, you go first.
---
But that would mean less money for them, they want us to waste dust.
---
I would be perfectly ok with having to recraft whizbang every expansion
---
I might just try playing a different deck. I haven‚Äôt tried N‚ÄôZoth, is it strong right now?
---
Wild secret mage players can go burn with ragnaros
---
Another Aventus clone?  P'thhhh.
---
They do have some advantage, because they got to play with the mode early, but that advantage will quickly vanish as more and more players learn how to play BG correctly.
---
But leaderboard doesn't matter right now. There are no tournaments based on it, no extra rewards, anything. It's just for fun. So what's the problem, exactly?
---
"A large part of the player base is existing players who dont start from scratch when a new expansion is released". It should be clear from context.
---
Sometimes I really hate some reddit users who read only the first 2 sentences of a message and feel the need to make a smartass reply. Anyone who reads the message would know that I clearly put the players into 3 groups: new players, existing players and whales. I specifically talk about new players' expectation and what blizzard can do for them. In fact, half of my suggestions are targeted at new players.
---
It already exists: \[\[Ice Block\]\]
---
How? I've played Quest Hunter and Combo Priest this season.

Yeah nzoth rogue is pretty strong.  Just get khartut defenders on board.  Rez them with nzoth, and then shadow step and/or togwaggles scheme the nzoth.

I think what china does to its people is awful and how "American" companies use that situation to exploit cheap labor is awful, but why are you boycotting blizzard for this one thing?

---
&gt; 2 elementals 5/5 with rush on turn 5 is not ok. 
---
I'd argue it is when you have to purposely play inefficiently, conceding the board and often about half your health while you're at it, for as long as Untapped Potential asks.
---
To even complete the quest in time to play Oasis Surger on curve requires you basically discard two cards from your opening hand too.
---
It gives the deck a serious, hard to overcome weakness to aggressive strategies that make it fairly easy to counter if push ever comes to shove.
---
Um... no?  I never said that *anything* was against democratic ideologies.  Just that my personal preference on government control on raising children is that it should be minimal.  And even I will happily concede that in certain situations I *do* want to see government interference (an obvious extreme example would be when a child is being physically or sexually abused).

The drops now are awarded from Twitch directly to your account. They make the raffle from "Hearthstone viewers" and no longer from a bot checking individual streams. Or that is what most people think since now it's from a notification from [Twitch](https://Twitch.com) rather than from a private message. I searched the internet and couldn't find anything so take any info with a grain of salt.
---
Its fun watching you mobile players suffer.
---
Twitch viewers != the whole playerbase, especially when a game was not made with streaming in mind...lol.
---
HS engagement is realistically online only as it's only available digitally, although it is available for PC and both iOS and Android which reaches to a larger userbase and poorer countries, along with the F2P nature that makes it more reasonable for poor people who can afford their phone but not constantly paying for their hobby. Obviously Fireside Gatherings are supposed to require being there physically, but they're still done digitally through an online presence and people have used tricks to circumvent the need to be there.
---
MtG engagement is both online and offline, and the online version is still very new and not easily available except on PC and iOS and is not very (or at all? Haven't played, personally) F2P friendly which limits it's playerbase to those who can afford to play it. Physical MtG is far more accessible though as it's usually easy to build a deck of cards acquired freely from friends. Also, FNM is one extremely consistent MtG event out of around 1 million+ sanctioned events run each year.
---
Okay, good for you.
---
I'll be honest with you, I've stopped accepting friend requests from strangers because the last 3-4 have all been nothing but toxic bm, then immediately being blocked. 
---
But I feel for you, I miss having friends who played regularly.
---
If by giving a hint you mean explicitly saying they won't, that's correct.
---
Tldr lmfao. HS has more engagement period. Your retarded ramblings don't change that.

Stop talking about MTG no one fucking cares. Why did you bring it up? Seriously lmfao ü§°

Wow did you really just admit to that?
---
"I would only hold up a bet if i won" 
---
"Im right because thats how I interpreted it"
---
Both of these statements are rediculously immature. Guess i shouldnt expect much else from a dude who took a massive leap in logic fron a very simple explaination just to spite people who dusted their cards. 
---
Grow up man.
---
Which still isnt bad. Deathwing could get through multiple khartut defenders with reborn and you still have a board that can go face.
---
Did you show them the way out?
---
Stoneskin basilisk. With divine shield and poisonous, this would likely surpass Maexxna at every point.

Also most old players auto squelch at the start of the match so even that little bit of interaction with emotes is gone. It's such a shame.
---
Morning standup? Details. We need more details.

And video.

But that beautiful moment when you and your opponent are caught in a never ending loop of "greetings" or "thank you" almost makes it worth it.

The first one is realistic; I doubt anyone who was into this bet could afford to hold up to it. I didn't expect anything from the start.

"Objectively bad" is such an overused term when talking about China.
---
There is no such thing as "objectively bad." I get that you want to emphasise how black-and-white some of the shit they do is, but using inaccurate, outright *incorrect* statements like this is just silly.
---
Moral Realism makes extremely little sense. Unless you can put forth an actual system that is *proven* to tell you how moral or amoral a given thing is, it's unreasonable to try and characterise any moral conundrum, no matter how obvious, as "objectively" good or bad.
---
Small pet peeve of mine, but there you go. In future, I'd suggest saying "Unambiguously bad." Same idea, but less inaccurate.
---
And in case it comes off this way: no, I am not focusing on semantics to digress from the points you're making. I think your approach is very reasonable, and I'm not inclined to disagree with the content of your arguments.

Blizzard has proved that time and time again. They are so eager to do business in China but haven‚Äôt moved there. That‚Äôs terrible, muriel

That's sorted highest price to lowest so compare your collection to that.

I belive you are being sarcastic, but i cant tell because maybe you actually feel like accomplishing things and i wouldnt judge whatever you feel like is right...
---
Is that an arcane giant
---
They do have an office there, and that's all they need.

I was saying the entirety of blizzard should move there given recent actions and design decisions

Questing Explorer does indeed work with side quests:

Makes sense since you can't play Quests and Sidequests at the same time. The game mechanically treats them as the same thing.
---
yeah de devs confirmed that you draw a card with sidequests - question is if you draw 2 cards because you can have quest and sidequest in play but going by logic and how hearthstone works most of the time it aint gonna work that way.
---
If anything, Blizz would downsize in the US until only corporate staff was left, then outsource everything to china.
---
Gwents "pick" system with it's packs was so freaking awesome.  Getting a legendary and being able to pick 1 of 3 choices was such a cool move that gave players an actual choice in what they want.
---
I also do this for my 2nd graders.
---
I can see this happening in the next 5 years.
---
Bugs in HS? No way!
---
More importantly, it's a value effect. A big lategame value bomb may be great, but it's not going to help you beat aggro shaman.
---
not really. once you get the jist of it, its very much grind heavy. then after that when everyone is high, getting certain heroes literally can make you win the game so easily.
---
I always add people after a somewhat cool game and we usually have a nice chat. I think people is too fearful of the possible toxic player.
---
I may be an otaku, but even I have standards

the fuck is this? a copy pasta? or you this stupid?
---
I've watched hundreds of anime, but the last isekai I've seen was Girls Bravo back in 2004. Not my type of genre.

4 hours in, got access. Git gud

Isn't that literally pay2win then?

I just want the Thunder King cardback...

Discover power and Flo Slatebrand. Then get as many copies of Flo as possible.

For early runs, take ol faithful and scattershot. Draft for beasts and on damage effects.

This is the first phonecall I've listened to where Hearthstone was brought up and talked about in a more negative light, as they said it explicitly said it endured another quarter of lower player activity/revenue. In previous phonecalls when Hearthstone didn't perform as well, they wouldn't even mention Hearthstone outside of a new expansion coming up, so I had to find that information exclusively from their Form-10Qs.
---
One of the investors actually asked J. Allen Brack to clarify the challenges Hearthstone was facing, which he responded with the rise in competitors and the addition of battlegrounds (plus maybe stuff in 2020) as means of getting new and existing players back into the game. I thought that was interesting. What could come in 2020? Another multiplayer mode? Another single player experience outside of Dungeon Run? Who knows. They have to use the added developers somehow. It could also be fluff and maybe we won't see another major addition in 2020.
---
As a whole, I think Blizzard is aiming for 2020 to be back on a year of growth, what with another expansion to WoW and potentially the sequel to Overwatch getting released.

You can't select these decks though. On mobile it's impossible. On PC I can play the last selected deck and it will ignore the fake incomplete status. But You can't select a new deck that has the incomplete status. You click on it and press no to the popup and that deck does not get selected.
---
But if you do the workaround thing and leave the deck selected it will stay selected (on PC) after restarting the app. So you can just press play and it will ignore.
---
I‚Äôm on the 6s and it works very well. The only thing I could complain about is that while looking at your hand, you can‚Äôt click the tavern tier up button and when looking at your notifications or control panel you might accidentally rearrange your minions because they kind of glitch out. For some reason, I haven‚Äôt been experiencing all these bugs that everyone‚Äôs complaining about.
---
Glad you people are voting with your wallets to keep things the way they are.
---
I beat this deck every time I play it and I play 4 different off meta decks. I always get excited when I see Druids. Free win. EZ clap!
