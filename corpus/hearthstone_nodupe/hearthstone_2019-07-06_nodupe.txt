How can you not see the sarcasm?  Let‚Äôs talk about who‚Äôs the sense one here.

---
Oh geeze, Reno's finally going to tell us how he singlehandedly beat that 29/29 C'Thun.  
---

---
We didn't know because it hadn't happened yet.  
---
I will say that Lazul is the only one of the League of E.V.I.L. who seems concerned about Rafaam watching them. Like, everyone else is chill about going to see Bob the Bartender. ...but when she does it, she says things like "Rafaam isn't watching, let's rest a bit" and things like that.
---
American movies, shows and music are as common in the UK as British ones. An American game doesn‚Äôt sound ‚Äúweird‚Äù in the UK. The same is not true in Spain or Latin America.
---
Ask me anything but only expect me to answer specifically selected questions with pre-planned PR fluff. Cool.
---
Players must've missed your memo. I'm a R3-5 and haven't seen Mind Blast from standard priests since before RotS. Got hit by a rogue though.
---
I agree, but have to admit that OC may be onto something. I don't think Reno is Nozari, but I do think he's a dragon of some kind
---
Search for "Sailor Moon PSAs" if you wanna see some diamonds of american tv...
---
Well, he was the final challenge in each "wing," so he was a boss in that sense.
---
I mean yeah, they unnerfed molten giant and moved it to wild
---
Stop advertising your circlejerk crap here thanks
---
Doesn‚Äôt this only work on the slight chance that you draw Tilanji?
---
You just stopped at the bar and shuffled more copies of your friends into your list.
---
I'm not saying that it was making the class viable in the current meta, I'm saying that mind blast being gone makes it even less likely to become viable in future expansions. Sorry if I worded that badly.
---
And with Dr Boom‚Äôs hero power allowing you to use the discover a mech feature more than twice, the odds increase even more and give you a high chance of ever discovering two of them
---
Your comma game is solid dude
---
Question: he posted class breakdowns, but were the actual decklists available to anybody? The article seems to say yes. If so, then that was a much bigger deal than the actual leak.
---
jaboc#1172 NA, quest trade, i'll show you go first
---
They probably will print a cheap damage spell for Priest. That's the business model, code-worded as "design space", and having powerful evergreen cards go against it. But printing powerful expansion cards is what keeps the game going, even if it's against the "class identity" - and actually, it isn't, because several cards that go against it every expansion simply make the game exciting, especially for the new players (and that is what is desired in this business model).
---
All in all, this is the direction Blizz is going - making the evergreen set less powerful in order to get more money from the expansions. What could be expected is not a buff to Velen, but, perhaps, a powerful burn spell for Priest in one of the upcoming expansions, which may even lead to nerf of Velen. But most likely, he will stay as a niche card that shines for short periods of meta and then goes back to sleep.
---
I think you guys don‚Äôt even know how ironic that statement is. You‚Äôre whining right now, you‚Äôve been whining for weeks. You little boys are way too emotional.

The next meta is going to be worse ... Reborn? Quests?   
---
They are moving more and more into printing cards that require no skill what so ever that can still reward wins ( think Zul'jin or Dr. Boom ) as this way they can attract a larger audience because people enjoy winning and if you don't need skill to win ... profit.

This hurting

Okay. But is there anything wrong with wishing they would do so? I‚Äôm not sure why you have to come in and be so negative about this.

And, like other people have said, they did this exact thing with Molten Giant before. So it‚Äôs not exactly an unreasonable thing to ask.

&gt; In no card game do you know other opponent's deck type or list beforehand.
---
No offense, but do you even play other card games? Especially at a competitive level? Generally decklists are public information. This is the fairest way to do it, because otherwise people with large friend networks get a leg up, since they can all share information about their opponents (or just people they saw play) with each other.

Exactly how I feel lol it's like who can play less hearthstone and win is the better player. ROS was my first expansion and I quickly fell in love with rogue after jumping ranks first with mage, murloc shaman, and then mech paladin. Just the diversity of every match with different card classes makes it so fun and different every time
---
Have you played in the Witchwood meta? It was obviously a Paladin themed expansion.
---
It looks like you played against RNGesus

"It's like who can play less Hearthstone"

On point.

Why don't you use spellbreaker though? Surely + 1 mana for + 2/2 is worth it?

If someone doesn't like card games he doesn't think to buy the preorder in first place. He seems to list some negatives as peculiars only to HS when they are general ones for every card game in the market.

Actually appreciate your comments.. didnt buy the last expansion which was the first in about 6 i didnt and dont regret it at all.. mostly just playing a value shaman i enjoy
---
Was thinking i might buy the new expansion because of quests, i was always frustrated i didnt get all the old quests.. but ur inevitably right, 4 or so decks will be popularised and dominate the ladder making it relatively unenjoyable...
---
I have enough dust really so will resolve myself to holf off again and try f2p it out, craft a couple of things i enjoy and stick with it in a more f2p capacity
---
I have two big grievances with the game really.. id buy an expanision if i got good value for money and i could play a diverse array of decks, but ¬£50 on a couple of legendaries is a joke, HS is simply poor value for the money u put in
---
Secondly the biggest issue with the game is the brain dead net decking community.. playing the same shit and stagnating the game, theres no solution to it unfortunately but copy and paste deck codes should be removed.. it wouldnt stop the issue but would create an inconvenience that would have a little effect...
---
Hey man good on you for being positive and all, not being sarcastic.  
---
But I'm pretty blunt when it comes to expressing my opinions and that's just how I am. I ain't gonna sugarcoat my words just because it upsets a few randoms on the internet.
---
And hey that's all I did really, expressed my opinion even though it came off a bit harsh. Did I harass him and call him stupid names? I don't believe I did so makes me wonder why y'll feathers got ruffled. One guy here called me a "piece of shit" though but I don't see anyone calling him out.
---
What a legend: killed all other minions and both players!
---
I think 6 mana is a bit expensive. I would lower it to 4 and maybe give it a +1 attack
---
Yeah, and so were Boomsday and Rastakhan because odd paladin was still the strongest deck in those two expansions...
---
Try getting Golden Candle and make sure his board is empty when playing it. Completely shuts him down.
---
Then it probably would have been easy because as I mentioned even with +5 to spells they could wipe my board or at least remove a creature.
---
Blizzards identity guides are supposed to be about how the classic set defines the class and their vision for them going forward. The rotating sets can address weaknesses in the classes differently. In this case they wanted to make summoning minions into a mage archetype. Once the support rotates with the xpac, mage will continue to have swarming minions as a weakness. It‚Äôs not that hard to understand. 
---
Having said that, mountain giants do feel unfair especially paired with what *feels* like unlimited stall with cyclone created-by RNG, i.e. freezes, pings, etc...
---
This is not oger, no oger no ransom
---
How about no. There's enough cancer decks in wild without patron warrior coming back. She can get in HoF and get reworked in a way that doesn't make her beyond useless but returning her to her previous state is a no from me buddy.
---
Just craft Zilliax. He's one of the best neutral minions in the game and played in a ton of decks in both standard and wild. 
---
100% worth just crafting him.
---
Yeah sure buddy. Shaman's weakness is card generation apparently. And then they decided to preview a shaman card generation card for SoU. That blogpost was just a fucking joke.
---
I thought that the site was closing? if it is business as usual then thats great because its all on there in a nice countdown!

Fair enough pal
---
1 pi√±ata and 1 deadly shot but also i recommend you to change the 1-2 taunt with anoter bot if you dont have the legendary bot 3-4 for 6 mana (i dont know his name)
---
He wants to have the recipe for the vial of sands, make a ton, then sell them for a lot to Goya and the black market. With the money bribe Gallywix and use his power to dominate the world. 
---
Thats my guess. Of course theres some weapon in Uldum. 
---
Somebody make a book about this
---
Then fix the problem, don't create a new one to patch it. I always thought that Jade druids were OP. Jade Idol should cost +1 mana (up to 10) every time it gets played. That way you can balance it. Removing cards is a cheap way to solve a quite simple problem.
---
So what's the cutoff for you?  40 years?  50?  Some other bullshit number you decide on to try and invalidate a point that you missed the first time around?
---
They were. I was shown some of them before the decklists submission closed.
---
Hey that‚Äôs actually a good idea, nerfing jade idol like that.
---
Truthfully, I think it is antithetical to what they want hearthstone to be as a game. Look at the art changes for more: they want hearthstone to be a rng-filled mobile game for children. 
---
This explains why a tournament mode was back-burnered, the art changes were made, cards with simple rng-mechanics are designed at the pace they are, client design changes(more than 9 deck slots? CONFUSING!) And it's also why the streamer/pro scene is dead as doornails.
---
At the end of the day, blizzard just wants to milk the mobile market targeting children with a simplified digital ccg loaded with rng over real mechanics. I would not be surprised if the pro-scene got the hots treatment at some point in the future given the fact blizzard does nothing to Foster it.
---
You do you man I'm just putting my view out there for other people to be able to read. I've tried all the other card games and nothing is quite as fun as hearthstone. 
---
I didn't make this account to reply to you but OK.
---
Probay minor patches for trivial stuff that keeps the game running. Pretty common for all games across all platforms, they just hotpatch in the little stuff and you never notice it
---
The concept has existed since vanilla. Mill Rogue was a deck back then.
---
The concept of straight removal from deck has existed since Knights of the Frozen Throne, which is not at all one of the "last sets"
---
So yes, I will tell you no. No lines have been crossed just because you dont like something. Maybe they will make it better in the future, but it's going to take a lot to make it actually playable.
---
In the words of a weirdo I don't understand:
---
"I don't really understand negative posts like this"
---
Mill makes you burn cards IF you can't play them quick enough. You can counter it as soon as you notice your rival is a mill rogue. There are even cards who can counter mills (Mana Wraith to name one). But a minion with a battlecry that eliminates your cards... you can't counter or forsee that in any way.
---
You only pick it if its good in the matchup / situation.
---
So basically American Gods HS edition.

The thing is most people still buying packs are hopeless addicts and won't less to your advice.  They'll only quit Hearthstone when they find something else to get addicted to.

I wasn't joking. I think risqu√© characters have a place in family comedy, as long as they're people, not prizes. I like the idea of a Succubus clocking off, changing into some comfy sweatpants and watching a movie with her dog. Being a manipulative temptress is just her job.

Lei Shen is tied to Uldum. He's the reason the Forge of Origination was used and turned Uldum into a desert to begin with.

I think it will likely be on this page once announced: https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/cards?set=saviors-of-uldum 
---
There are several locked slots at the top of the page, separate from the unrevealed cards below, with a disclaimer saying "Displayed in Local Time". I think it's a good bet that those slots will be used to show upcoming announcements after the full schedule is out.
---
Dust your bad cards, make good decks.  Really hard to be viable as a f2p without doing so, surprisingly easy to have several legend viable decks if you do.  Just don't dust good cards to make good decks, the rare of return is too bad on that trade.

I don't see how the least popular spells can have pick rates so close to 1/3. Assuming every valid spell is offered the same number of times, which should be approximately true, the average pick rates would have to be 1/3 since you're offered 3 spells and pick 1 of them every time.
---
Mirror entity is actually over 1/3 and the other four on the bottom aren't unpopular enough to compensate for the top five, let alone every other spell.

That‚Äôs what I love about quest mage. If they don‚Äôt have coin turn 3 Barnes or turn 4 Barnes it‚Äôs usually GG.

Problem is: There is really no good advice to give here. 1x Pi√±ata, 1x Deadly Shot is only recommended, because 0x Pi√±ata is the actual advice.
---
Your Deck is really all over the place. If you like it that way, then any decision you make is the "right" one.
---
How Long Can This Go On!!
---
Origination would certainly fit the bill of obliteration of civilization as they sing in the new intro.
---
If you know you are going to spend real money on cards, the preorders are a good value though.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs just an archaeology symbol on her arm. Since this expansion is about the League of Explorers returning, the symbol reappears.
---
So, you made a post about how obnoxious destruction cards are not based on how effective they are but out of mad because your friend couldn't play around the enemy?  Man...

Yeah, I cant tell if he's a serious douche or just a shitty troll

r/hearthstone has always only been memes, screenshots, and otherwise low effort posts. Go to /r/CompetitiveHS for actual discussion

I dunno, this is one of the better troll accounts I‚Äôve seen.  They seem to have mastered juuuust the right amount of narcissistic condescension to piss off damn near everyone. Their post history is a trophy case of shitposts designed to offend.
---
What do you mean? The list show 5 most and least popular picks only. Unexpected results pickrate is in-between them so it doesn't get showed. There is nothing to do with time. UR pickrate will never beat the top 5.
---
A major problem with Warsong Commander in its current form is that it's going to get virtually no support in the future, with Charge being essentially phased out for Rush. In Standard, the only place it likely ever has any chance of ever being played with currently, the pool of cards that synergize with it will eventually drop to whatever ends up being in the Basic + Classic sets. Including duplicates, that's 18 cards, which may seem like enough support for the deck, but it's cards like Stonetusk Boar, Bluegill Warrior, and Southsea Deckhand that would see most use alongside Commander, though the usefulness of those cards traditionally have nothing to do with their effects and everything to do with their tribes. In other words, Charge Tribal just sounds bad, even if you're limited to only what's in Basic + Classic. I doubt any amount of Inner Rage Sudden Genesis would make that version of the card be too good.

Outof.cards is the correct url.

This list is of the "Most and Least popular". Unexpected Results probably fits between the two.

Alright I dug it out

There‚Äôs also some comments in the other thread linked + on the comments around this one.
---
Interesting. I personally run a variation of Evolve Shaman and it's pretty fun to get random minions on the board, lul.
---
Do you really think mage would be priest tier without it? They have so many other strong cards and conjurers is crazy enough to see play at 4 mana because of mountain giant.
---
Chances are if you're preordering, you're NOT getting the legendaries you want.
---
I used to fall for that trap, but it's not going to happen.
---
The list show most and least popular picks, so nova, MI and evocation is definitely is in-between them. Icecle is probably higher than the secrets too because it can be combo-ed with sorcerer and cyclone.
---
&gt;I don't know is it slower or faster than just buying pack to collect card and dust
---
If you can reach 3 wins on average, it's the same value as buying packs. Any more than that is better than buying packs with gold.
---
doesn't matter if you are holding them all ;)
---
That‚Äôs why I only play priest in wild or a weird steal/inner fire version when I actually play in standard.  Wild priest is an absolute blast
---
That‚Äôs definitely fair, Mage got a handful of trash but the few standout cards from RoS really make Mage decks atm.
---
50-60% is more realistic (at least for RoS in standard)
---
The keep word is "dominated". I think bomb warrior, mech/midrange hunter, cyclone/freeze mage and tempo rogue makeup 90% of my games.
---
During the end of an expansion cycle, the game does become significantly less fun. You can only play with and against the same decks for so many weeks/months before it gets boring (least for standard).
---
Yeah, thought the same. Something's fishy there.
---
No, I made a post about an event I witnessed.
---
Do people just eat jam on a spoon? Interesting
---
Yeah Blizz went all-in on their own website recently. It basically mimics the in-game collection now, and they are even giving us the flavor text early on the new cards there, too.
---
I've got mixed feelings about everything. Not normally one to unload publically, but I'm taking heart from OP's confidence. :) I'm not a WoW buff, and I've got no real qualifications (just a foundation diploma in design).
---
* **Succubus/Felstalker:**
---
* **Cons:** The risqu√© nature of the Succubus reinforced how sordid and underhanded Warlocks were. We've already got Warlock cards that summon identical demon hounds (Rin, Portal Keeper etc.). They've been established as warlock tokens, and this one doesn't really have any more personality than they do. It also lacks any thematic connection to the discard mechanic.
---
* **Pros:** Felstalker fills the frame a bit more neatly, and has nice, energetic artwork in line with an agressively over-statted minion. The Succubus didn't really have any thematic ties to (hand) discard either. The modern idea of succubus is that they'll bargain short-term pleasure for long-term damnation; that's more in line with a Fel Reaver "weaken your deck" or a Felguard "weaken your mana curve" effect. And yes, it means that little Timmy can have fun after school without getting a clout from his fundamentalist mother. That is, technically, a good thing.
---
* **Bite:**
---
* **Cons:** First off, recrop that art. The way the jaw cuts off looks awful. Secondly, we don't need *another* Druid spell that's a ferocious, leaping predator. We already have Pounce, Barkskin, Savagery, Feral Rage, Mark of the Loa and Predatory Instinct. Claw and Savage Roar in particular are going to cause readability issues for new players.
---
* **Pros:** It's a more "active" image. In general, spells feel good when what they show lines up with what they do, and that usually means that the art should show the initiation of an action, rather than the aftermath. There's a bazillion exceptions to that, but I'm trying to be nice. Bite used to show a guy that had been Bitten. Now it shows a cat about to Bite. That's neat.
---
* **Deadly Shot:**
---
* **Cons:** This is actually the one I have the most issue with, just because I think the old art was as close to perfect as you can get. It's got visual "punch", communicates perfectly the effect of the spell, and the actual structure of the image flows beautifully with the card frame. ([Image](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bHQ67VsMbxCdpqEYkxhWB6.jpg) \- Note how the outstretched arms form a gentle arc parallel to the bottom, and the horn traces another with the top). The new art feels very static in comparison, and even viewed alone it just doesn't fill the frame very well. There's a lot of bland, neutral space and the diagonal trajectory feels awkward.
---
* **Pros:** Like Bite, the new image is a more "proactive" one, even if it doesn't *feel* very energetic. What I'd love is a compromise between the two, chronologically - a startled Tauren staring down the shaft of a bolt in flight. Leave the gruesome aftermath to our imagination, like the dark comedy vibe of Sabotage.
---
* **Windfury Harpy:**
---
* **Cons:** The old art was slightly more agressive. Harpies are traditionally vicious, territorial hags.
---
* **Pros:** With that in mind, I think covering her up a bit was the right move. The new art flows with oval frame nicely, and the flow of the feathers really sells the idea of a nimble, soaring predator, like she's just taken off from her mountain perch. I also really like the more subdued art style - a welcome change from the cartoonish look of newer cards (which isn't bad, just a bit samey). Also, to be a neckbeard for a second, the reduced cup size is probably a lot more aerodynamic. I demand realism in *my* Wizard Poker!
---
* **Eviscerate**:
---
* **Cons:** That word literally means to disembowel. To remove the target's *viscera*. If anything, the existing art wasn't graphic *enough*. Forget the art, change the name.
---
* **Pros:** It's basically an unnoticeable change if it's not pointed out. So who cares? Another win for Lil' Timmy.
---
* **Secretkeeper:**
---
* **Cons:** Google wasn't very helpful in determining what a "Secretkeeper" actually does in the Warcraft-verse. It sounds like they guard temples, libraries and other hidden places of hidden knowledge; in which case I like the slightly wary, undready sense of the old art, as if the place she's guarding has never been discovered before. The unusually sharp style was distinctive, and a nice change of pace.
---
* **Pros:** I like the softer, richer style of the new art; the old art felt a little flat. Also, the new art isn't a "butt-boob shot". Make no mistake - I like butts, I like boobs, and I think "bawdy" elements have due place in Hearthstone's type of campy fantasy, and Secretkeeper is honestly a pretty mild offender. But butt-boob shots are dumb. Go find a full-length mirror, then pretend to be startled and spin around. Note that the twist naturally happens in your legs and neck, with your shoulders and hips roughly parallel. Now try it, but keep your feet planted and swing your shoulders 90+ degrees. Note that your waist kinda hurts and this doesn't feel like a very natural way to move. That's because the pose is largely a fabrication of comic artists to cram more T&amp;A into limited frames, and since its inception it's been something of a joke in the industry. It's an awkward, cringey trope. Besides, if you *really do* demand as much sex appeal in your fantasy card game as possible, I'd say the new version is showing more skin, more confidence and is generally more bone-able. Dat midriff doe. **Mistress/Queen of Pain**
---
* **Cons:** The old art has a much more sinister, predatory presence befitting a Lifesteal minion. The dark pink skin and glowing eyes definitely sell the "demon" tag. As someone pointed out, the new art is a recycled promotional image of a Heroes of the Storm skin. That's... lazy. Don't do that, Blizzard. You have artists, pay them when you need art.
---
* **Pros:** While the new style, pose, and palette are a little bland, the actual design is similar to the old one. Bizarrely so - there's actually more skin on show in the new art. I'm just confused more than anything, so let's call this another win for Timmy.
---
* **Headcrack:**
---
* **Cons:** I adore Headcrack's old art for all the reasons I adore Deadly Shot - dark comedy, visual "punch", full use of image space, and pleasant interaction with the curved frame. The new art feels a bit cluttered in comparison.
---
* **Pros:** Despite all of the above, I can totally see how the old art could be a mess to read if you combine weak vision with a small screen. I wish they'd just brightened it, but the new art does mesh with the theme a little better - a reloadable, face-targeted missile rather than a... mace? Flail? Seriously, what is that?
---
Whew! Well, that's 20 minutes of my life I'm not getting back.
---
I thought that username was familiar! So, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with this post and I agree with everything you‚Äôre saying, but I have a hard time hearing you specifically say it because you made a post a few months ago similar to this one saying you had had enough and were quitting because you were miserable playing the game.
---
what do you mean? this is /r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
Ill say it a second time, it's not about power. It's about terrible design.
---
The problem is everyone has a different definition of ‚Äòvalue‚Äô.
---
You realize that this post is the logical next step, right? I largely walked away from the game but now the new expac has me like "well hey let me see that" and I'm trying not to fall for it
---
My parents have a soup maker and a break maker bud no damn blender, do frozen daiquiris for me :(
---
Lol. Well that's your opinion. All this salt kinda has me wanting to play jade druid, ngl.
---
"I like your heart, I think I will take it!"
---
Yes. Let's create a permanent Brawliseum that's pretty much exclusive to people who have been playing for years and don't mass disenchant their Wild cards every year.
---
At least with Wild, you can craft Big Priest, Murloc Shaman, Jade Druid, or what have you once and always be able to play it forever.
---
In order to even play either a Seasonal constructed format or Seasonal Brawliseum regularly, you would need to have a Standard capable collection of each and every expansion set.
---
Well somebody lost their game
---
Before anyone mentions the 40 updates pending, I know... I update on demand.
---
Alright then, if you can‚Äôt put into words why you spiraled off into abusive comment after abusive comment because I existed and had a username then I‚Äôm going to be forced to assume that you have none. You have no reason, you have no argument, you have no purpose for me to stay here and take more insults. Swear your heart out on this next one, get all of you emotions out, I won‚Äôt be listening anymore.
---
Physical card games are pretty expensive. The only saving grace is buying singles. Still can be expensive that way too though.
---
I already did.
---
But keep pretending you can't read. That's better, haha.
---
At least they're reasonable about their complaints.
---
Whats the verdict looking like?
---
I'm just basing "value" on "lowest price". I understand I could just grind for hours a day in the hopes of opening 50 packs before the next set comes out, but I just want to buy a bunch of packs, and the preorders are the lowest amount of money I can spend per pack. It's an objective truth, idk why the downvotes about it.
---
Also, literally the reason I play this game is because I can actually play f2p. Just not with a huge collection.
---
Are you at all familiar with eternal formats in other games?
---
Even then, anything reasonable can get you up to rank ten in Wild.
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
You‚Äôre absolutely right to do so. Chances are the game won‚Äôt change much until at least next near‚Äôs rotation where I‚Äôm pretty confident we‚Äôll see a new format.
---
*America! Fuck yeah!*
---
It's hardly an opinion. Having the entire game decided by RNG on turn 4 is a horrible design if you want your game to be competitive. 
---
But go play idol to your heart's content, you won't catch me playing in the dumpster format.
---
Well someone just opened 40 packs to find one legendary.
---
I've yet to regret a pre-purchase but, then again, I actually like the game, unlike a lot of the people who, for some reason, keep playing something that they hate.
---
Ôªø
---
You're being hyperbolic and butthurt, so I'm going to go ahead and see myself out of this one.
---
It hasn't been nerfed yet because the decks that play it leave themselves open to getting slaughtered by aggression, and while control is the archetype Conjurer's Calling is the most effective against, Control Warrior can very much combat it reasonably between Brawls, extremely efficient single target removal, and other cards like Supercolider.
---
Cyclone, Dragon, and Freeze Mage can all still take game early if they draw well and their opponents don't better than most other decks currently, but between the difficulty of play and how if you draw poorly, you really draw poorly, the data on each deck has them hovering at just over a fifty percent winrate.
---
RoS and Uldum are bringing back cards and themes from previous expacs. I have a feeling the Old Gods will return, and Rafaams league will be the way they do.
---
Who Blizzard?
---
Nicely written, have my updoot.
---
Succubus was basically naked is this a joke?
---
The Shaman &amp; Warlock quests seem a tad underwhelming to me, which means they will likely become top tier within a month after release
---
I just do dailies without paying real money and it's absolutely enough for me. Hearthstone is supposed to be entertainment for me, so I'm neither planning to spend money or grind virtual money for it.
---
There is nothing with buying packs though if you think it's worth it and you need cards/dust. I'm just saying it's not necessarily great option for people living in eastern Europe, buying power of our currency is really low compared to US and prices don't translate very well if your only source of income is part time entry level job while studying.

Really the only wild deck I play right now is a handcuff Aggro Magnetic paladin deck. It‚Äôs pretty fun to play and I can usually draw the entire deck around turn 10 or 11 or so. It‚Äôs really satisfying to get something like a 15/11 leeroy or Zilliax or make a 30+ attack mech.
---
I'd like him to do me at rank 33
---
I don't live in eastern Europe but I have heard the actual blizzard store has a better exchange rate. I make enough to dump 80 bucks into the game every few months, so for me this is the smartest way to rapidly increase my collection of new cards.
---
Or.......20 ogres
---
What even is this sentence? I honestly don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre trying to say.
---
Yeah, it's a bit pointless, fair enough, but technically...^^ 
---
Well, I'll have to agree with you either way. 
---
What you say is based on further knowledge of the lore than my own, except for the Banshee Queen thing, but I'll sort that one out, once I'm a bit more awake than now. Have a good one
---
Risky Business
---
Well yeah the only deck that runs magic trick at all is *named after conjurer's calling*. No wonder you win a lot when you pick a 3rd copy.
---
They already have Plot Twist.
---
Also I think the portal demons (the ones that summon 2/2 Fel Hounds) count.
---
Mecha'thun Warrior and Shirvallah (Holy Wrath) Paladin are strong. Malygos Druid and Malygos (Vereesa) Hunter are playable. Malygos Rogue is too slow.
---
And it's full of bugs.
---

bro i know he was nerfed check the context of the conversation

Children‚Äôs card game
---
Paladin wasn't in a great place up until the Rise of Mechs card updates. It really doesn't take much to propel a class from the bottom to more than playable. The lowering of two numbers on two cards and SN1P-SN4P were enough.
---
The same sort of thing happened between [ONiK](https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot/standard/2016-09-18) and [MSoG](https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot/standard/2016-12-18) (when Drakonid Operative was released) for the class three years ago and between [The Boomsday Project](https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot/standard/2018-11-24) and [Rastakhan's Rumble](https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot/standard/2018-12-24) (When Mass Hysteria was released) just last year.
---
The Year of the Mammoth saw set after set of extremely strong Priest support (Shadow Visions and Lyra in Un'Goro, Shadowreaper in KotFT, and Psychic Scream and Duskbreaker in K&amp;C), which helps explain why last year was a relatively weak year for the class. 
---
Taking all of that away did definitely cripple Priest, and, yes, Rise of Shadows didn't instantly fill those hole, instead choosing to support what turned out to be a weak returning archetype. It's just not Priest's time right. Give it a few months.
---
On frost nova, you‚Äôre largely right, but looking at the current iteration of cyclone mage games often come down to who has more freeze effects. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs particularly healthy, the can of worms that is conjurers calling notwithstanding.
---
Sorry sir but the word ‚Äúforce‚Äù sounds a bit too violent for kids, I‚Äôd like for you to come up with something else to replace that word.

Lmao. I'm cringey because you can't afford to spend some money? I like hearthstone. Imma spend my money where I want to. Have you thought about getting a better job or something homie? It might help with your own anger issues.
---
Idk why you are accusing me of anger for making you read more. Is it hard for you or something? Either way, go ahead and hop off my dick about this, and maybe work on getting your own expendable income up to the point that a few hundred bucks a year doesn't break your bank.

Undying Cat comes back immediately wheras Dreadsteed does not. It is essentially a 2 card twisting nether that also kills any deathrattle summons

You need 4gbs or more for this to work.
---
yea that works, but i wouldnt say thats the same as removal
---
I'm not the one down voting, but you might as had simply said "Hey. The Classic and Basic sets should be completely revamped now and again. Here's a list of cards I think should not return in such a set," rather than going on a fifteen hundred word essay on how much you hate aggression.
---
It's cool and all, but it is not a big deal
