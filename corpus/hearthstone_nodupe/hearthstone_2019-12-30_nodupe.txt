Wax is pretty slow. his deathrattle being triggered doesn’t give u an immediate pay off. Take advantage of the devastating board presence other cards can give you,

That’s the joke jimbo

Ok, that was my initial thoughts aswell from when I started watching, but it's just that I just watched "Dancing through the bombs" Kripparians video and at 11:25 he got a 12/5 and a 7/4 Cobalt while dancing on another in the tavern (also buffs the Cobalts in board with a metaltooth to 14/5 and 9/4.
---
The danced Cobalt ends up at 15/12. Tripples it and the end result was 32/18 which could only occur if all three units statbuffs minus the base stat of the third minion are added.
---

---
So that just made me wonder why some do it one way in the situation I mentioned before while other do it another.
---
It’s the best 3 drop in the game if you’re needing one

That's what I'VE been telling myself because Gala Warrior just seems weak sauce to me. Clearly I'm playing it wrong. I must also be playing *against* it wrong because I keep easily beating it we with just about every kind of deck.

This was in wild AND talking about SoU meta.
---
Agreed.
---
It's not that hard honestly. Someone has a golden demon that has health equal to how much damage you've taken. I have seen it 100+ with like 6 attack. Add in some divine shields and Death Rattles your gonna do a lot of damage.

Why? Because I mention nec vial? It’s a good card, people run it for a reason.
---
Tbh it seems underpowered compared to Shaman since you seriously can low roll your demons and also can't react to your opponents board the turn you play it. The guaranteed 8/8s plus rush seems much more useful. 
---
Perhaps if we get a stronger demon pool going forward it'll be decent.
---
What's sad is I went through the whole post without realising it was a shitpost, then remembered priest existed because of this comment
---
Smeagolol#1477 NA 80g trade
---
It kind of goes without saying that, when you balance the Invoke cards around 4/5 of the classes getting some form of immediate Tempo, the one left out is going to be in poor shape. It was up to Priest getting actually good Invoke cards and it received... a 1/2 for 1 mana and an Assassinate that generates a random Priest minion (definitely worse than just drawing a card.)
---
But by God, Blizzard decided (for some reason) and Priest is (somehow) one of the EVIL classes (despite the complete lack of intention to push a deck for the class that has Lackey/Galakrond synergy) so the class gets to be saddled with an abundance of cards that can't be run (Remember Lazul? Blizzard really wanted Lazul for EVIL but didn't know what class to put her in. Like with most ideas they intend to abandon, they threw her in Priest).
---
I mean, it's still kinda broken since any card like alley cat generates gold.

It doesn’t give you 1-mana demons.  It gives you random demons, some of which are quite good.
---
also a 10 mana spell, ultimate ressurection, "fully heal your hero, clear the board twice, summon 4 ragnaros"
---
The bronze dragonflight had already been established as the sort of Dragons Paladin gets way back in BRM, and setting Rexxar with Nozdormu would really make even less sense as there is absolutely nothing connecting the two.
---
As you wrote, the more bestial proto-drakes makes far more sense to be in Hunter than really any of the dragonflights.
---
If any class should be associated with the red dragonflight, it should be either Paladin or Priest.

It really wouldn't accomplish anything. There'd be four possible situations when dealing with this draw proposal
---
1. You're losing when you offer, and your opponent refuses
---
2. You're losing when you offer, and your opponent accepts
---
3. You're winning when you offer, and your opponent refuses
---
4. You're winning when you offer, and your opponent accepts.
---
Most of the time, a draw proposal is going to be refused, making situation one the most likely. A winning opponent is unlikely to give up a win, but the only time when the draw will actually be accepted is when you, the player, have something to lose.
---
Luna's is unique, no replacement

1. Take a break

2. Pick one deck and stick to it
---
3. Pick that deck based on the match-up(s) you want to win the most

I like how you think it was Trump you were insulting. Can't even keep your own comments straight lul
---
Are you only doing Karazhan? Most of them needs a control deck to beat on heroic so look up a warrior control deck. I beat the lich king using that new armor breaker guy, only took me 2 nights to get the arthus skin.
---
Super weird question and do please forgive me. I’ve played for a year and am still relatively new to the hearthstone Reddit. Through basic inference I have understood that aggro means hardest damage possible early as possible, trading is sacrificing one minion to take another out, but what exactly IS “tempo”? I understand it comes etymologically from the Latin word for time and therefore must be relative to fast plays that happen quickly and early in the game, am I right to assume that’s the inferred meaning?
---
good luck
---
Just sayin’...
---
“Ranting without a constructive purpose is not allowed.”
---
(Including ranting about RNG.)
---
Personally think it's more of an r/softwaregore
---
Why wouldnt rogues run it?
---
Well it is to a point but it also takes skill. 
---
Yes theirs games where you get piss poor luck and fucking lose but I find those games to not happen as often. 
---
But I don’t take Battelgrounds as series as ranks, it’s just a fun mode to play for me really.
---
suppose the Priest Invoke worked like this: "Restore 4 Health to friendly characters (targets assigned randomly". basically twice as much healing as the default HP, but with an RNG twist.
---
yes, I realize that with Auchenai-type effects, this gets deadly. so if 4 Health is OP, how about 3?
---
I play exclusively wild and my Priest decks have seen no new class cards since Rastakhan Rumble. It depresses me
---
It's a great, common question that really should asked more. A lack of concrete definitions for how we talk about gameplay as a community is a reason there's always so much debate.
---
"Tempo" is generally meant to describe stats on the board. If you're trying to play a tempo game you're trying to end each of your turns with more stats on the board than your opponent. 
---
u/Winter55555 makes a good point when saying to consider the future. To fit that with my description: Maybe you can't get ahead on board this turn -- there's no cards you can or trades you can make. However, over the course of *x* turns you can get ahead. Understanding when you can take a bad turn to get ahead over the course of two turns, for example, is very important to a tempo game. Sometimes it's more than two turns, sometimes you can just go turn by turn.
---
u/Winter55555 also used the term "value" in his explanation. I'd say this is ill-advised. "Value" is a different term in Hearthstone.
---
The "value" of a card is generally defined as how many cards of the opponent it answers. A very simple example: Your opponent plays a Water Elemental. The only answer you have is 2 Frostbolts. The opponent won value because you had to use 2 cards to answer his 1. 
---
You can extrapolate this idea to two 30 card decks going to fatigue (Control Warrior mirror) and whoever gets more value will end with more cards and will likely win. It becomes more complex with card generation but the idea holds.
---
Thanks for the info, so I guess no point trying to get Firestone to work for me atm, if I'm interested only in Battlegrounds? I'm asking because I've installed it, but it keeps crashing on launch attempts.
---
Yeah, I agree 100% but the draw is not for mirrors specifically, is just for the tedious match ups, control vs control for example, while taking away part of the competitive experience which honestly is not the focus of the majority of players it makes it so more control players enjoy the game. aggro mirrors won’t concede, its fast while control warriors where stuck in matches over 40 min which after a while is just learning the match up, it’s still a game after all, and if it makes the game less tedious to play as a control player, and that makes it more fun overall
---
Edit: also those who want to still play the mirror can do lol, but having the option is better than not
---
Yeah I’ve never understood how people say that the meta is balanced like it’s a good thing. Rock Paper Scissors is perfectly balanced and it’s boring as fuck because there’s no strategy. The game should be about more than picking a deck that hopes to queue into good matchups where it basically auto-wins.
---
See Hysteria's latest compilation on Youtube. The vid is the one of highlights of the year, and I can't remember where it is exactly, but it includes a clip where he does around 500 dmg by playing the Rogue give 3 coins guy over and over again while abusing Nozdormu and finishes the opponent with Spectral Pillager.
---
Edit: Here it is, starts at 25.10 https://youtu.be/mOPedBDqn5o

It looks like you floated mana while holding cards you could have played. That was your misplay.

Google her if you're really curious.  She's an "adult actress" featured in hits such as "Welcoming my step-bro home."
---
&gt;be able to tech against warriors being able to stall the game out with cheap, mass armor gain
---
Fair, but removing all armor is way too far. It just pushes any deck that wants to stack armor out of the game.
---
Going all in on dragon synergy is a pretty good drafting strategy in arena right now
---
I don't actually know J's list but i'm using the one from hstopdecks, maybe it's the same one. First of all it's a horrible matchup. My advice against face hunters is, try to mulligan for your backstab, 1 drops and apothecary. Dwarven sharpshooter is low threat since they want to go face with their hero power, the real problem is phase stalker. Sometimes it could be worth keeping a backstab even if they have a sniper on board in case if they also have a stalker in hand. You either take care of an early stalker without it casting a secret and win that way (doubtful) or magnetize a zilliax on a 7-7. They generally run freezing and explosive but some of them run misdirection to cheese you into damaging yourself, try to play around that if you can. Also try not to go too wide as they can punish you hard with an unleash the hounds, try to go tall instead. Titanic lackeys are good in this matchup but thats pure rng ofc. And yeah the chances are you will lose but it's the decks worst matchup for sure (and rogue class in general).
---
It was a complete disaster When they did it in magic. First only one deck was viable then they had to release hard counters to said deck (there was a card with x color (class) can’t do damage anymore or something close to it. Causing a very unbalanced meta for multiple expansions.
---
For both the opponent and the priest player
---
I feel you, it's my most played class by far and I haven't touched it in like a year. Wish we got a full rework so they can start giving us real cards
---
ALL minions.
---
No it's not interesting. It's a stupid question. Flik destroys all copies.

Probably playing outdated meta. Find the new decks. Or ( learn the meta and counter it, which is easier said than done)

Galakrond Zoolock, It is super fun to play and does well against rogue and priest. As long as you don’t run into too many aggro decks it works really well

To much different Stuff Put together. Doppelgangster is to inconsiatent without duplicates. Also to much expensive Stuff. You generate value via the Quest. More small Minions give you actually more value because they get the Quest faster online and are easier to combined with your Heropower. Get some cheaper removal in. Cut some big Drops Like alex

But u get to flood the board early, giving u advantage early game.

Why do you think a 1/1/1 charge would be played in zoo when boar isn’t, and what’s so scary about printing neutral charge that Priest can use when Stormwind Knight has existed since beta and has never been a problem with Priest?

Why not run Breath of the Infinite instead? It works with the dragon synergy and would get rid of the treants (at least before the new Treant legendary hits the field).

I honestly don't have that card. I'll have to try and craft it. I've been playing since Blackrock, but I'm still a budget player so getting packs is tough.

bless blizzard spaghetti code

Sometimes weird stuff happens.  You'll notice that odd cases as they stand out more than you'll notice the common case.  Probably just weird luck for the most part.
---
Thanks man
---
A pack with nothing good, still cool tho
---
Well, lots of people play it, and as the vS report says, it is an underrated card. Keep an open mind as to what might be good. Not just to improve in HS. This thing you did here, dissing me and disregarding my opinion because you’re so sure your flawed understanding is right, that’s not the behavior of people who learn, grow and have good relations.
---
Just a classic pack right? Back when HS had Heroes of Warcraft
---
Axeel69#2444 EU trade u go first
---
You’re probably right. I mean you can only play against seven people so the odds of it happening aren’t that high.
---
Get 1k wins
---
Honestly don't think it is as fair now if you look at the more refined list. The quest is terrible though... you're playing a lot of bad battle cry stuff for one pay off of 4 8-8's and that is if you draw your Gal in time.
---
If you’re up against a heavy control deck then they can definitely outlast Rexxar. You need a few more control cards for it to work best.
---
Yeah, rogue is the next one to need a new alternate hero.  Seeing as hunter now has 3 possible heroes, rogue could use another.
---
Current standings for number of alternate portraits are:  Rogue: 2.  Warrior, hunter, mage, priest, warlock: 3.   Shaman, Paladin, Druid: 4.  
---
Good news is that they've said that new heroes will be in the shop, with druid getting one quite recently, so we probably get more soon.
---
It truly depends on how your deck is built and who your opponent is. If you’re going for late game and so is your opponent. Then maybe you want to play him early to ramp. There are also some scenarios it’s best to keep him early. In shaman where they play the 1/1 murloc in almost every game, I will keep to turn 2/coin or turn 3 for the crab that destroys a murloc. You gain quick board advantage and leave your opponent to deal with the board while you ramp up. Basically in almost many cases you want to keep cause you don’t know what you’re going up against until your opponent plays cards.
---
All his Subscribers be like: Who is this woman And why is she touching The Mayor!!?

Being ridiculously overpowered is "fun" in any PvP game. For one player.
---
...you don't get notifications that it's coming ...
---
It just happens when the month rolls.  
---
It's only worth the push to legend is you've never been to legend and want the card back.  Otherwise legend is a really bad place to be with longer wait times and a reward that amounts to not even half an average packs worth of dust vs rank 5 floor.
---
Imo if you have gold use it on arena.  
---
It's playing something different for one thing and another if you get reasonably o.k. at it you'll end up with more value for you're gold.
---
Don't bother buying packs with real money this game is garbageo
---
The fuck is the point of this...
---
The hero power bit was funny.
---
The 5/6 taunts were only one of the examples and I like how you conveniently left out the 8/8 rushes. I even terms of setup, even you have to agree that shamans have the easiest way of setting up galakrond.
---
I bought out the hero power as an example how shaman can easily dominate the board, I don't know what's going through your thick head to start bringing out data and comparing which is the worst deck. But I'll humor you and ask which other class can fill a board as efficiently, consistantly and strong as shaman?
---
Also, if you actually learnt to read and saw the comment you first replied to, I've already mentioned 2 specific decks that counter shaman.
---
Whinge, whinge fucking whinge.  
---
No one cares.  
---
Bye.
---
Definitely better for later play.  Setup a win or come back from a bad state.  
---
In the past whenever I saw him played early for "tempo" i was always grateful as the opponent, meant I didn't have to face him later and ruin my day.    
---
In standard tempo isn't really a thing anymore with the massive power shift we have now.  You might think you're on top and then they play a card and you lose.  
---
Don't confuse arena with standard. ;)
---
Can't believe Admiral's AI Druid isn't in this. He did somehow end up at like 100 legend with it.
---
I never liked nomi druid I preferred malygos quest but I’m enjoying a quest dragon druid. No Elise. Basic quest shell with dragons and Ysera &amp; floop. It’s rly fun. Not sure how good it is tho
---
I can't think of a single example in the current meta where playing him early is a good idea unless it's against a deck you already have a massively favorable matchup against that it would forgive such a misplay.
---
congrats!
---
Your logic to discredit their comment isnt right.
---
The average has always been and will always be 3 wins, yes. But the standard deviation is what good players rely on. 
---
Of course there are people getting 12 wins now that never have... As with any month, week, or meta. But you can't say that people are necessarily replacing old high win rate players' spots.
---
Rather, what's also entirely possible is the formerly bad players are now simply doing better... But not good. Maybe 95% of people finish between 2 and 5 wins now as opposed to 1 and 7 as before (made up numbers to show the point). I.e., moving closer to a simple coin flip (e.g. who goes first).
---
Tbh i don't know. But that's certainly been my experience too. I'd be interested to see statistics. I averaged 5.4 to 6.1 the past 2 years in every meta I've used a tracker before this one. I'm currently at 4.1 with 20 something runs.
---
You dont need a boardclear for 2 5/6 my man. If you do youre doing things horribly wrong. I didn adresa the 8/8s because i already did. Use a boars clear or hex/sheep/shadowword death or whatever.
---
I compared the two decks because you seem to struggle against an inferior version. That indicatea that you have no clue how to deal with gala shamy rather than it being OP.
---
Rez Priest, DR rogue, embiggen and treant druid, gala warlock *all* have faster or better ways to fill the board.
---
anything with a potential tempo play cause all the other Gal get a tempo-ish hero powers
---
Highlander mage is sub 50% win rate in the current meta.  
---
Burning Zeph early for "tempo" or "ramp" is about a bad of a play as it gets in this meta.  I can see why the win rate is so low now.
---
I've actually been playing a 100% random/discover card priest at rank 5 no stars since I got bored of laddering after getting there with pirate warrior. It's incredibly fun especially when you turn into a resurrect priest in mirror matches. 
---
Galakrond's random hero power and both highlander cards being random effects allows for a cool deck with different outcomes every single game. 
---
The deck isn't all that meta but I've had more fun playing these games than anything in years, probably since Dreadsteed got nerfed honestly. And I don't even own all the legendaries I'd like to put in this deck (though they get generated a lot anyway).
---
Because it’s old now and we all have it, and now it just means you forgot to change your cardback.
---
I think we have a new mayor of value town
---
As a tip (if you care about golden heroes) Always play in ranked. No matter how bad you think the deck is. Every win you get in Casual could’ve been another step toward 500 wins!
---
The original comment wasn’t funny, but this is a new low of humour.
---
Name checks out
---
Nah. You're going to buy literally everything you can and aggressively collect for triples in order to discover into your build.
---
Not sure you understand statistics if youre arguing this.
---
https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/355/face-hunter
---
Hunter wins slightly more than 20% of the time. The quest priest loses 1 in 5. To paraphrase my favorite statistician: "a 1 in 5 chance isnt that rare. 1 in every 5 weekdays is a friday. Do we end every week saying 'wow its a friday! How lucky are we?'"
---
Some times the hunter wins. And sometimes the priest comes back at the last second.
---
I like how this is all my arena games ever. 
---
I really should watch Kripp more and actually pay attention to his plays instead of trolling him for his misplays... But I mean wheres the fun in that, right?
---
Ungoro was pretty fun.
---
But you're right that there never was a 'truly right' meta, some problems are always there. That doesn't change that even though flawed, those former meta's were still miles ahead in overall experience.
---
It'll be different every game. Learn your matchups and when you queue in. I'm I'm playing vs a deck that's gonna just try to keep hitting me in the face, I'll keep him for clears or heals.  
---
In a super slow matchup, if I'm running a late game deck, I might keep him for wild growth.  
---
If I'm playing a game where I know he's likely going to be a finisher, I'll probably mulligan him. Also applies if you've built your deck to tutor him with witchwood piper as an example.  
---
There's no right or wrong answer really, it's just about context. Best thing to do is learn your matchups and brush up on your classic cards, so you know what you can find. From there, just don't be scared to play him. I see people just sit on the card until lethal, but sometimes there's just better and stronger zeph plays in the turns before that that could end the game much earlier.
---
This is a great video! I hope Derryl doesn't get nerfed or removed anytime soon because to me he is the most interesting and fun hero to play with.
---
Found the priest main.
---
How this doesn't have more up-votes is beyond me!
---
Honestly would have expected a news hero for each class at the beginning of each new season
---
crafting whizbang is the worst advice you can give him, not only it rotates out soon but does nothing to make you a better player.
---
better learn game basics and start your own deckbuilding with the little cards you have
---
I don't think "you've practically already won" is accurate, so you'd get to tier 6 and then what? "You've bought a few good minions in between" does not equal a good build, you're going to very quickly get outclassed by superior builds that have spent time buffing their minions and having synergy, whereas you have a some random mid-tier cards and a chance to roll into some high-end cards, which almost certainly won't be synergistic with your build because you almost certainly won't have one.
---
It takes a lot of times and rolls to reliably get a good build, levelling to 6, with a board of very mediocre cards is not a good way to win.
---
Same. I'm so confused how it's a tier 1 deck. I rarely lose against it, and I don't really feel like it's that strong when I play it.
---
40 dust
---
I was a first time legend this month too with a galakrond rouge.After i hit legend my specific deck didn't work that well anymore.Lost to rank 5000.I saw that post of that galakrond spirit warrior and climbed again too top 1000 legend.
---
This is the exact deck list i run.Very favourable against handlock. Every matchup you can win even rez priest.The hardest matchup is an anubush deathrattle rouge who draws the nuts. This deck doesn't run out of steam as the other galakrond warrior with all the draw and i find it much more consistent and is played more as a control warrior. Some really fun interactions are in this deck I let you give me some of my experiences.
---
The zilliax don't use his shield while he is immune a gamewinner for some of my games against aggro.Rush your kronx out with a rush lackey to make it immune.The dragonlackey is really nice aswell if you can get it with evasive dragon.With scion i can usually rush down a necrium apothocary with 7/7 inside and still have board.Siamat is a beast ofcourse with rhino but players also don't expect this. To play a windfury divine shield against a galakrondwarrior who still is looking for the combo is gamewinning.  And lastly your deathwing can become a 16/16 it is awesome.
---
If you life the turn after you play galakrond you most likely won.This will be my deck to push for legend my second time begin january.
---
Thanks! Going to try to use it. Great job
---
Not really. Look at highlander mage it's a control deck but it can win without grinding the game because it has a lot of threat and value.
---

&gt;you're going to very quickly get outclassed by superior builds that have spent time buffing their minions and having synergy
---
This misses the point where at every stage you can completely refresh your board if you want to. Practically every minion in the tavern is free, since you need to sell a minion for the board space anyway. You will have a board full of random 4/5 tier minions while your opponents are getting synergy in tier 3. Sheer size is what wins in that situation, and once you get to tier 6 there are so many minions in the tavern that finding strong cards with synergy is trivial.
---
&gt; She is also WAY too common.
---
I don't find her to be that common in drafts. Usually when I see her, it's "created by **Blue/Bronze/Emerald/Primordial** explorer". Those pop up in drafts pretty commonly and it's not hard to plan to draft for highlander but grabbing two explorers to use to discover.
---
I know he’s against a Druid too but he could have been board cleared, so putting useless stats down could be a bad strategy if the whole board is cleared the same way with the bad stats down or in hand. Allows a recovery tool after the board clear.
---
This deck is incredible fun to play though hard to master. Thank you! Hillarious and the opponent do not expect what hits them. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Question. I see that the deck struggles against highlander mages and treant druids. They can utilize the 10 mana quite efficinetly. What is your advice? Should I play Noz on turn 4? 
---
Thanks again,
---
Draxx
---
It can get even bigger, Golden brann stacks with normal brann
---
That's not how you win in arena.
---
He is countering thought steal obviously
---
What's that bosses hero power and name? Never seen it before either
---
Humm, that card back would be a reason to go for it.. Congrats.

You're not a better player just because you play decks often deemed to be difficult to play.
---
Having a staged date &amp; dating someone are two different things. Pretty sure she’s been withe the same dude for the last year or so (shoots scenes with him etc).
---
Regardless, the very least she could have done is blown him for the duet video.
---
por qué
---
I understand, and the Anduin interaction was admittedly something I hadn’t considered.
---
I wouldn’t really call Even Paladin a meme, it struggles because midrange doesn’t do very well in the wild meta, but it only needs a few cards to make it a good deck.
---
Yep pretty much, you'll dominate in the early game but you'll quickly start to drop off and have next to no chance in the late game unless you get very lucky.

Sshe got divorced, she was on the rajellor for it, you can check it out on youtube

And from Dungeon run id like: [Lyris the Wild Mage](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Lyris_the_Wild_Mage) (would be first elfmage,and belves are like the magic race in wow),  [Thaddock](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Thaddock_the_Thief) (first female orc hero) [Chronomancer Inara](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Chronomancer_Inara) (who would be first undead aswell) .

From munster hunt:  [Azalina Soulthief](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Azalina_Soulthief_(boss))  [Forlorn Lovers](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Forlorn_Lovers) (ghost hero would be neat)  [Sazzmi Gentlehorn](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Sazzmi_Gentlehorn) (A satyr hero would be cool aswell) aswell as the 4heroes we play as ofc.

Also all of the Troll Heroes from Rumble Run(theyre all voiced fully anyway).
---
Would all be cool to have aswell as portaits,though the dalaran heist,troll champions and montser hunt heroes would be most realistic since they got all lines already done.
---
Man I wish, I only beat him with one class and thought I would unlock Arthas that way...I was so wrong.
---
It's a dating show on twitch, it's the rajellor. She chose him as a romantic interest over 10 different guys
---
Heavily NSFW if you’re as naive as I am
---
I literally can't believe that I won this game.... that Paladin must be pretty butthurt about it ha ha ha. I think I'm currently 17 win 14 losses. At one point I was 11-2.... And then I stupidly tweeked it for some reason and started losing. I like the current build though surprisingly solid.
---
Thanks watching 😉
---
Wait... Hang on.. You can't just put that there and not out the video up!!

I'm now 100% going to Google this because if there's even a 0.5% chance it's true... Man the odds on that must be...

You have to burst them, and pray they don't have a wall of provocs when you are ready to do so
---
I was just playing an arena game on my phone and I disconnected not being able to reconnect, and there is nothing wrong with my internet, so yeah, I think there is something up with the mobile version
---
True - I was using the WoW wiki to jog my memory, so I forgot about the Hearthstone exclusive characters. Hooktusk would be the better option.
---
Well we'll put it this way... most searched for names in 2019 of the... Um let's just say NSFW variety... She was top 5 on that list...
---
Lana Rhoades was top of that list for those who are curious...
---
For those who are even more curious... DO NOT GOOGLE IMAGE THAT NAME AT WORK!
---
frozen throne wasnt necessarily a song but it was by far my favorite out of all of them
---
strictly on song its uldum
---
It's fine if you think about it, the straight path is the hs career and the mangatrain is changing lines in the drawing. If anything they should've flipped the image of the mangatrain.
---
I can't compare with other iPads since I don't have one but maybe they accepted an update that can't be run smoothly on it... Can't help you any further

---
Would it have made a difference at all if Goldrinn was where Lightfang is, and Lightfang was 2nd from the right?
---
Dont read comments before watching the video.
---
A good bunch of references, like having his own hat in there, or the hat-kid hat from "a hat in time"
---
3 hours long? Damn didn't know Trump had that kind of stamina
---
But she had a boyfriend and she was in an open relationship when she went to to the rajj show
---
I think team 5 dropped the heroic tavern brawl entrance fee from 1000 to 150 gold because not enough players actually want to gamble that (though probably more would have with better average rewards).  
---
Besides that, 3 rounds of bo5 will usually stretch over 3 hours, not to mention OP's challengestone-style live deckbuilding. Some games can have modes which demand that, but I wouldn't expect hearthstone to.  
---
I think the only reason in-client tournament support is worth developing is to run official tournaments without a third party. If that also makes independent tournaments easier to organize, that's only upside.

I’ve seen all except the Sack of Lamps, but I’m pretty sure it is real.
---
For context: I’ve played through Tombs of Terror tons of times; I’ve unlocked all the Heroic run Sr. Explorer treasures for each of the four Heroes. And I’ve never encountered these three treasures. I found the list on the Hearthstone wiki of Treasures last week, and decided to look into it a bit more, and even watching other people’s runs on Youtube, I’ve yet to see myself or anyone else encounter them. Can anyone confirm that these exist in Tombs of Terror?
---
in my eyes the best player in hs history at his peak. this guy was coaching other top pro players at the age of 14 ffs. his handlock and midrange druid was so good.
---
Get a life guy.
---
Tbh I’ve never heard of her before this, but considering everyone is going “holy shit Trump and a porn Star are singing a duet!” It’s pretty easy to figure out what she’s famous for.
---
Do you know of any video or image proof of someone finding any of these? I’ve looked and tried finding the treasures myself and couldn’t. What does ‘Blow up half your opponent’s stuff’ do?
---
Pfff! She only wants her deck!
---
So many hours and never a minion with better stats than 68/68?
---
Also why the hell is Finley in your top 5 lol.

---
Is that Highlander Druid? How is it working for you in such fast meta?
---
They went on a "date" in a reality tv show sense.
---
Ya I remember that Hassan got kinda pissed cuz people were mad at him for not taking it serious or something and he was like guys this girl literally already has a boyfriend who I talked to before going into this and was given false information about the whole thing just roping him in for the content there was no way this girl would date him after the "date" because she had a BF and was just in it for the pay
---
I've seen Trump use flexsposion before, I think. I know it exists, I've used it myself. The other two I havent seen before in my runs.
---
Lmao malfurion lookin like a 10 yr old girl.
---
Thank you. Was it on Heroic, or Normal, do you know? I’ve been questioning if maybe the two non-passive treasures might just not be in Heroic as the best explanation I could think of, since they are strictly better than most other Treasures. Do you know if that might be affecting it? My search has almost strictly been in Heroic.
---
The card acted like it wasn’t there, it was highlighted when hovered but couldn’t be picked up like I could with the other cards.. So there just wasn’t an option to even drag anything if I can’t pick it up.
---
Jojo poses?!?
---
They are real. I have been offered Lucky Spade twice and Flexposition once. For Sack of Lamps you need to pick Zephrys' Lamp a bunch of times, probably in a row and maybe even have it be offered twice in a single run (like I had). One day, it will forever upgrade to Sack of Lamps.
---
Yeah Highlander Dragon, not a great win rate but fun need to adjust for more early.
---
That’s interesting. I’ll try taking Zephyr’s Lamp whenever it’s offered and see if something happens. Thank you.
---
I believe the first and last are rewards for specific encounters.
---
Maybe blizzard is punishing me lol I fought two in a row
---
Haha I stole a Menagerist Amalgam as Rafaam once, probably my best stealing moment
---
It's a blank copy, wouldn't have any powers.
---
I absolutely love the music of the last few expansions, but I can't understand a good chunk of the lyrics. 
---
I'd say my favorite is Blackrock Mountain.
---
To think some people find pirate warrior fun.....

But only an hour, since that many people drinking would destroy earths reserves I think.

DoD is forgettable AF

He's highly skilled, talented, motivated &amp; successful. If these qualities aren't likable because he didn't cater to twitch chat degenerates, then you should reconsider your priorities in life.

No. I don't downvote people for their opinions. I do make a post explaining why I think they are wrong. I don't need validation in the form of a score next to someone's name.

Wemen bad
---
Oh fuck it all makes sense now
---
Im assuming they meant traditional actors in more widespread media, no pun intended.
---
at this point you gotta question why do you play a pc game? i am ok with skipping animations but what you want is not seeing the game at all...
---
Face hunter and Combo priest are decent decks, very cheap to make, and can stand with a couple of economic substitutions.
---
I'm building upon my Combo priest foundation and with just a single legendary card in my deck (build the obelisk) I get a 45% win rate, which sucks in itself, yet you have to consider that I started playing a little more than one month ago and that I bought only the the package with the tree gal druidess because I really love her voice. I don't even use a druid deck right now, lol.
---
One month, very little money invested and a decent grasp of the game mechanics and I touched rank 11 in the current meta with just a single legendary. I'm not going to win the world championship and I am still an apprentice but I feel good about my achievements.
---
Cool.  Here's a few lists.  Note that you get the galakrond cards for free when you log in and open a DoD pack.  You WILL need to craft kronx, but if you do he fits in to a LOT of decks on the list for multiple classes so he's very well worth it.
---
https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/decks/warbringer-deathrattle-rogue/
---
You can replace flik and anka, as getting apothecary is THE card for the deck, eveyrthing else is kind of optional  You can replace the legendaries with a rush minion or two, some more draw, etc.  You've got zilliax and leeroy which are the most important of them.
---
https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/decks/treant-token-druid-2/
---
Since you missed out on SnipSnap you can replace it with something that builds a bigger board, faceless corruptor, or lots of other token options.
---
https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/decks/7-scions-galakrond-warrior/
---
Just an example of a galakrond warrior deck, but it's easy enough to change around.  You can swap out the legendaries you're missing for more aggressive cards like kokron elite, or you can go for a more cycle and combo heavy package with stuff like acolyte, frothing, and bloodsworn mercenary for bigger early boards when combined with inner rage.  There's a lot of variations out there right now, and a lot of them run less high end and focus more on aggressiveness.
---
https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/decks/highlander-galakrond-rogue/
---
Given that you've got Zeph and Alex, you're pretty set on this deck.  While togwaggle is nice, he and flik are replaceable, either by just some big minion or a spell like walk the plank, or just a big ol whelp for some extra draw.
---
https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/decks/galazoo-warlock/
---
Of course, zoo always works, and this is a pretty strong list.
---
Then there's a galakrond handlock which has been doing pretty well for me:
---
AAECAf0GBsUE2waggAORsQPjtAPxvwMM4QfECJ2pA+WsA+isA+qsA+usA+ysA/6uA6qvA9OvA4KxAwA=
---
Note that you probably should be crafting Kronx, as he's useful in multiple decks that will stick around for quite a while.
---
Because you can generate infinite value Emerald Drake into Emerald Drake into Emerald Drake might not seem overpowered but that's one card generating a shit ton of value.

Square#1230 na I show, you go
---
Holy shit you fucking killed him dude.
---
&gt;"He has potential therefore its ok for him to come off as an ass and you're bad for not enjoying it"
---
He didn't do that. You're just being over sensitive. What happened? Did he ban you for spamming trihard or something?
---
&gt;Where's the logic pal
---
He's skilled through practice, motivated &amp; successful. Mostly notable due to the age at which he started making so many accomplishments. If you don't find logic in appreciating these qualities, that's not a reason to dislike someone. That is more about either your jealousy or your inexperience in life.
---
This is more obvious bait than combined 35 attack Cobalt Guardians.
---
That makes sense, but is not as hilarious as I had hoped.
---
Oh wow, that’s scummy as hell. Did they even say anything, or just ignored the outrage?
---
Rogue is a problem and here is why:

[Click here for decklist](/r/hearthstone/comments/eholj2/any_point_in_playing_right_now/fckokgi/)
---
Btw i edited the last sentence a bit since it read wrong.
---
There wasnt much outrage, i've found out a month later by accident.
---
Forget to mention that he ropes literally every turn and misplays as a result
---
Congrats!
---
She’s in an open relationship though
---
You can do both.
---
Prostitution - the practice or occupation of engaging in sexual activity with someone for payment.
---
Did she not get paid to fuck people on camera? Do you think she was just doing it out of the kindest of her vagina?
---
Yeah, its those things
---
Hello incell. How is your shame jackoff?
---
... yeah if you have to use a definition to distinguish the two then you obviously have little to no chance of understanding how the two professions are undeniably different... 
---
It’s like saying someone who fights as an actor is the same as someone who gets paid to actually fight people. 
---
Yes she is getting to paid to have sex in both situations but prostitution is getting paid by the person you are having sex with for the sole purpose of the sex, where as a pornstar is paid by the director or maybe the production company in order to use her for videos. It’s just not even close to the same...
---
It wasn't always overpowered, and was still considered one of the most fun cards.
---
I should hope a strategy works if you get the two core pieces of the build really early lol. Saying “the strategy can still go top 4 with the highest of high rolls” is basically calling the strategy terrible using more words.
---
R/blatantlyspecific
---
Thanks for doing these. When DoD dropped I claimed cube lock was still tier 1, glad to see it’s considered the premier warlock deck after crabber got nuked.
---
Bro, you're in a Blizzard subreddit, ofc you're going to get downvoted for this.
---
Carefull wipe your hands before writing on your keyboard.
---
Although I agree with your standpoint, the TwitLonger never states that the prize money, the game, or the scene as one of the reasons he quits. 
---
&gt;but over the past year I’ve lost the fire I once had for competing in Hearthstone
---
And this was exactly noticeable while he was playing in GM
---
That doesn't mean every match has to be a coinflip, though. There's good RNG and bad RNG, and when highroll decks are strong, that's bad RNG.
---
Mia fucking Malkova? Jesus, he didn't just get like any pornstar, but one of the literal best in the industry.
---
Trump's getting that sweet sweet overkill value
---
Try harder baby troll. You're supposed to be at least a LITTLE subtle.
---
You had him during the doom in the tomb event, all the cards during that event were given only during that event
---
Sure, but all the points you mention could easily contribute to someone losing the passion for the game they're playing.
---
Of course, it's just as possible that the game not being enjoyable was literally the only reason for him to quit.
---
None so far though, I've been really hoping HDT would update for this
---
Getting a Test Subject in your hand immediately keeps the game flowing versus discover.
---
Lmao eye roll 
---
‘Holes’
---
Please
---
Yeah, if sky raider generates it, it is not summoned.
---
By the old gods, imagine though if they are actually good for each other and fall in love?!
---
Cannot even play practice mode to unlock other characters??? Sorry but I must be stupid. Blizzard are not making this easy for me
---
It says force of nature +Savage roar got nerfed which is correct Fon is no longer 6mana summon 3 Trent with charge that die at the and of turn
---
Anubisath Warbringer deathrattle triggered 7x times :)
---
Force of Nature used to have charge treants so it was nerfed.
---
Ohhh I see, if the problem is "but Hitler" then I think I can fix this for you.  
---
How about Jack the Ripper my dude? He was talented, and motivated. Always made sure they were dead. Had a real drive and passion for his work. He was so good at murdering he's still famous to this day!  
---
You've gotta really like a guy who shows all these positive attributes, and if you don't then it's unfounded slander and clearly a flaw in you, as opposed to in good ol' Jack the Ripper. Probably jealousy.  
---
That work out any better for you? Starting to realise what people might be getting at now? Or do u need 16 more examples of talented people being shit people to drive home the fact that there's no correlation? I'll wait, at this point I'm just here to support u and help u navigate all these HARD TO UNDERSTAND COMMENTS :(
---
I’m honestly not sure why it won’t let you play it, it’s probably something you’d wanna try blizzard support for. I’d also recommend unlocking all 9 classes by playing against the inkeeper in solo mode. I seem to remember having to unlock all classes before being able to play against other players, but that was nearly 5 years ago now, and you seem to already have played against other players, so maybe I’m misremembering or they might have changed things
---
Just to be sure, we're going to need OP to try 531,440 more times.
---
Report back ASAP please OP.
---
She picked him because she knew she could build a career off him and his fans. At least that was my first thought when I saw the contest live.
---
Where do I type this
---
I mean, this sounds like it's basically a reality TV show that was streamed on Twitch.
---
You called it- the shills got a whiff of you talking minutely negative about Blizzard and they're crawling out of their caves ( Mom's basements ) to defend.
---
Snip snap (and other echo cards) got nerfed so that their price can not go below 0 in a patch a few weeks back.
---
Rusty Recycler is not a good replacement, and neither is a Deathrattle that disrupts Apothecary consistency
---
It's alphonse elric
---
In the most recent set, yes. Not older sets though.
---
Also wouldn't recommend dusting Legendaries unless it's really bad
---
6.9k Upvotes.... *smirks*
---
Ahahahaha Oh my god.
---
Are people really this stupid? A dating video, are you for real. How many videos do you put up of your dates.
---
This explains why youtube caters to the most common denominator of society, to fool dumbasses like you.
---
Curious what your budget Rogue list is?
---
Who needs hands anyway?
---
obviously the right play is to sell everything buy rivendare and selfless hero
---
Bruh imagine of trumphs was your wife’s boyfriend....I...
---
Unless they changed it that's not true. I remember making f2p accounts and you'd always get a legendary in the first 10 packs of every set. Not just the most recent.
---
That drawing looks amazing i love it
---
I think the same there would be no mechs without him and is funny when u see everyone going for mechs and u know someone will fuck up cuz there won't be more of that guy
---
JOJOLION
---
Lol
---
You can outvalue them if you play the whelp deathrattle
---
And you can outvalue them pretty easily
---
JUST 11
---
Do you have Aluneth? If not then go Face Hunter in Standard.
---
Wow
