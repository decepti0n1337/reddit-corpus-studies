We live in a market with global ramifications and Blizzard works with China.  Blizzard also has shareholders, employees, PLAYERS etc that rely on them to be successful.  Take out the China market and we might not have any tournaments with prize pools, we might not be able to pay GM players who rely on it for rent... we might not have these games anymore.  
---
The white knight soapbox shit needs to end.  I support HK and their people and want the best for them but that's a political issue that has nothing to do with HS.  Blitzchung fucked up when he politicized an event that could have major ramifications on Blizzards business.  Blizzard didn't ask for this, they didn't want to co-sign activism.  They wanted to have a HS tournament, advertise their brand, and pay players in their community.

Holy shit, you people are mindless.

1. even if you could implement all the reforms you want you can't really fix something that is broken at it's very core.
---
2. The political system and economical system are inseparably tied, to claim one exists interdependently of the other is absolutely absurd. The capitalist system will always create a political situation where those who have the most capital will have the most political sway, and they will inevitably put that power towards further advancing capital.

Reddit won't do anything as Tencent invested about a billion and a half into them a few years back. Does not at all mean we shouldn't still try, but Reddit as a company is going to be complicit in this.

people like me? there's nothing two faced about what ive said. ive simply stated my disagreeance about their take on the situation and how it is not enough for me to feel comfortable supporting them any further. seems like that is making you upset but there is nothing dishonest about where i am coming from.

Firefall shut down after like...two years of questionable design decisions?
---
He definitely did some good work as part of the Classic and WC3 team *as far as I heard*, but Mark Kern is not exactly a developer with a stellar record for amazing triple AAA games. The games he did develop well at Blizzard were a team effort of the entire team, and probably succeeded because of it.
---
So you're just disregarding the fact that the rules, to the letter, state that a player's prize pool would be reduced to $0 in the case where they disrepute a portion of the population?
---
You just wanna ignore that, and say that the right call for blizzard would be to selectively enforce their rules for the viewpoint that you and I think is right?
---
ELI5 for r/all who is Kibler and why is his opinion and stepping down so significant?
---
Exactly right. 
---
80 years ago our grandparents were fighting and dying to save the world from a very similar authoritarian regime. 
---
Now in 2019 companies are censoring themselves and bowing to these regimes just to make money.
---
It’s infuriating. I hope this anger lasts.
---
It’s also really good. One of the better strategies in a deck builder is getting fewer cards in your deck so you find your better ones faster
---
You realize that the entire Chinese internet is monitored and people are toeing the party line right? What people say behind closed doors is far different than what they say publicly under the watchful gaze of censors.

Look, I'm not taking a side. I don't really care either way, because I don't worry about things I can't change. In the mean-time it is fun to poke and prod at people who do think they are making a difference by throwing tantrum on the internet.
---
Mark was removed because he was driving Firefall into the ground. He literally removed PVP from the game without telling anyone beforehand - people simply logged in one day and it was gone. No other devs or the community folks knew this was coming. He also wasted huge amounts of money trying to push an "eSports mode" and kept forcing folks to remake the base game systems over and over and over.
---
He was a cancer there and thinks he's god's gift to gaming. He's an avowed GamerGater. Don't let him fucking whitewash his past.

---
I actually quit HS because I felt it was getting boring and lack of new contents, but seeing what blizzard had become,  I am pretty happy about my decision
---
Yeah, for real. This is not their fault. Executives made this happen, not low-level employees.
---
This is a rational thought blizzard had to punish him and the casters, but they went way to far with the punishment and that’s a problem
---
If you really feel strongly about the way blizzard is being run. Uninstall. That's what I'm doing.
---
They kicked their off tank, so they needed another off tank :/ They both played on the account: [Take a look at this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/acpc3y/a_summary_of_the_ellie_events/)
---
Honestly, this post hits the nail on the head exactly. I was really enjoying WoW Classic and when I first heard the news, I unsubbed but having some sub time left I thought I could at least still use it up and I could hope that Blizz would make amends before the time ran out.
---
But then as the day went on and as I looked deeper and deeper into the situation, into Blizzard's response, into the communities response and searched my own feelings, by the time I got home and would normally log in... I just stared at the black screen and felt my very being vehemently opposed to the idea of even opening the bnet app at all...
---
This act by Blizzard... hurts so much, it's been apart of my life for so long now, I can't believe this disgusting corruption could seep into our safe, fantasy world... But that was foolish.
---
It's almost poetic, that this should happen so soon after Blizzard released WoW Classic and in a sense, handed us our childhoods back... for them to do this, to slap us in the face with reality so harshly... drove home better then anything else ever could, that our childhood is long over, and that we cannot hide in the past any longer.
---
I think that if Blizzard had just included "no politics" in their rules and cited that rule instead, there would be nowhere near as much backlash.  The fact that they cited a catch-all rule is where they screwed up.
---
Wow, that's a lot of organs! At Red China for an unlimited time enjoy 30 kidneys for $10.99! What sounds good to you folks tonight? 30 kidneys, please. Great choice! With children's kidneys, men's kidneys, women's kidneys and our fantastic ethnic minority's kidneys, that's FOUR different kinds! 30 kidneys in one ice box just $10.99! And only at one place: Only at Red China. And bootlickers get kidneys too. A complete kidney, just a dollar ninety nine.
---
And what have you done lately? They risk their source of income/livelihood for speaking against blizzard. They are doing the right thing even if it means they could get banned when they could easily just avoid the issue
---
Tldr: grow the fuck up
---
So lets find their extensions and leave the grunts out of it? 7 digit extension number
---
China can go fuck itself and I've unsubbed from all Blizzard games. Having said that, read my fucking reply you dumb fuck. The casters got fired for goating the player into saying something political which is against Blizzard's rules. I disagree with the punishment but you're a literal troglodyte if you don't understand how these things work. Eat a fucking dick my man.
---
&gt;  but Blizz was in the right to penalize him for it to discourage GM being used as a political tool
---
Meh, if you win a tournament you can consider the speech as a prize and you should be able to talk about whatever you want.
---
You can say whatever you want but you cannot do so while standing in my backyard.
---
See above post.
---
&gt;Knowing better would be to use the proper platforms to express your opinions. Taking blizzards platform and using it to attack a huge business partner of blizzards is assinine. The GM of the Rockets used a third party platform on his own personal page to express his opinion. The thing is China is doing so many wrong and downright evil things that people could care less how the message is sent as long as its sent. And everyone wants to jump down blizzards throat. I agree with the message and things the casters and player said i dont agree with using blizzards platform.
---
China/Hong Kong doesn't give people "proper platforms"... Talking about the issue, period, and China/Hong Kong will send detain their citizenry. Even for saying shit online. They have mass surveillance programs that regularly monitor stuff. That's why, before filters got better, you could send Chinese people to jail by sending them certain content within emails. Hell, that might even still stand, but I wouldn't care to test it.
---
Proper Platforms when you're given none is "purposefully obtuse". And blizzard can bleed whatever tiny amount they will for supporting such punitive actions "on behalf of"... The reasons China has such ability to oppress comes down to money. And USA and corporations support China through money. Blizzard is as guilty as any other company.
---
Yeah it's full bandwagon going on. Why are you people boycotting a company with ties to China only now? It's not exactly a new conflict.
---
You make me laugh
---
nobody ever said " KILL CHINESE!". Dude just said "FREE HK".

Why the fk someones freedom is their issue?

It is a chinese account run by a chinese person in chinese to a chinese public. This is filtered through the eyes of china. We will likely get a very different statement in english.

or you could pull your head out of your ass, realize its all one company playing both sides of the aisle, claiming to cherish western values while at the same time shutting down any and all discussion about anything the chinese dont like.   
---
Fuck blizzard, fuck the CCP, and fuck everyone defending or excusing this.
---
I was offering countries of different government types.
---
What is a country that we should mimic?
---
All the countries I would like to live in seem democratic and capitalistic with select socialistic policies.
---
By definition? Sure, the state owns much of the production. But the reason for it being a shitshow extends far beyond that. Much of it is because it’s also a dictatorship.
---
About the Edit: Kern simply recorded a ten minute video talking into the camera, speaking about Blizzard fans when they were discussing Classic and considering their options in the wake of the Nostalrius shutdown.
---
He did absolutely not *relaunch* Classic or was part of the team. In fact, people criticized him even back then for appearing to use this to try and get a job at Blizzard again after leaving in 2006 to open his own company. That company eventually voted him out for the Firefall thing. That was around the time the Classic debate happened, I believe.
---
His message about how involved China is in the western market is right, but JFC, he has a habit of inserting himself into the "popular" side of internet controversy.
---
The rule he broke is actually a common rule to have and enforce. It allows them discretion to punish people for misconduct that hurts their image so it cannot appear that they support such behavior. When applied fairly its fine. It tells them they should act professional and apolitical.
---
I know it's largely not about separatism - separatism is sometimes discussed, but doesn't have significant support as far as I know. But I'm not exactly a Chinese person.
---
Did you hear what the pro-Beijing people were saying during the protests in Canada? They said "One China, everything else is negotiable". To them, it clearly is a separatism issue. 
---
When you see graffiti on the protest streets saying things like "Hong Kong is not China", protesters coming up with their own national anthem or flying foreign flags, references and entities with ties to China being vandalized, etc. it's pretty easy to misunderstand.
---
Though at this point I would say 'maintaining HK autonomy' is probably not entirely accurate either. The biggest threat to HK autonomy was the extradition bill. Outside of that I haven't really seen any encroachment on their autonomy. More relevant at this point is probably police accountability and greater balance of political representation.
---
&gt;The casters for Riot Games generally refer to teams that have "easy" to say names by the full name regardless, so I highly doubt any of the casters were going to call them "Hong Kong" and not "Hong Kong Attitude."
---
I feel like they called them "Hong Kong" a time or two while watching in the groups stage--and yes, thank you for the correction. I keep making that same mistake, and I'm not sure why!
---
I mean game design choices directly effect them. They stream hearthstone and other games for a living. The hong kong protests, while important, dont directly effect them.
---
Kibler is right. Tournaments are not a platform to announce your politics. The punishment was overboard though.
---
Would you be happy watching all your esports just be a Trump 2020 advert or Orange Man Bad advert every time a player is on camera? We do need spaces where politics is kept out, there is literally no areas in our lives where the political war is not front and center now. A firm stance on politics from Blizz is mandatory regardless of what it is supporting.
---
In all honesty, Blizzard dug themselves a massive hole with how they handled Blitzchung’s expulsion from Hearthstone Grandmasters. They’re gonna have to take a side. They’re damned if they do and they’re damned if they don’t suckle upon the CCP’s teat.
---
Had they given Blitzchung a lighter punishment in the first place like a several match ban and a small fine for breaking their rules and using their event as a political soapbox, they could have certainly saved face with both their Chinese and international audiences and this situation would have blown over. But now, they’ve given Blitzchung the harshest possible punishment. If they back down and renege even one bit, they risk the wrath of the Chinese public and government. It could lead to them getting banned from China outright.
---
On the other hand, they’ve alienated so many of their Western fans that reports on Twitter have shown their website actually buckling from the sheer amount of users unsubscribing and making account removal requests. This is the worst PR disaster that Blizzard’s ever had. It’s so bad that it also led to politicians speaking out against them, which is absolutely not a situation Blizzard want to be in.
---
As for what I think will happen... I see Blizzard issuing a statement in the coming days. They will back down, rescind their ruling against Blitzchung, pay him the $10,000 he’s owed and apologise to their fans. I also see them speaking out in favour of the protests in Hong Kong because they’re likely going to lose the Chinese market anyway.
---
Why do I think Blizzard will do this? Because they honestly have a lot more to lose from alienating their core fans than from pandering to China, especially when the spotlight is shining upon them harder than the NBA. Anything other than a full 180 on their stance will come across as insincere.
---
Cool, but people are well within their rights to hold it against them later. "Where were you?" will be a legitimate question as the suppression of HK escalates.
---
I'd relate it to all the whitehouse aides and officials that refuse to rock any boats, blow any whistles, or even testify in a lawful Congress setting. They're making a choice with (at best) inaction, and when this administration is over and through, they'll deserve to be judged for it. They're just looking out for themselves and their career prospects, but we as the people don't need to be putting what *they personally want* (financial security) over what we ourselves want (accountability).
---
Being on the wrong side of history isn't inconsequential, and nobody should get a pass for trying to take the easy way as far as they think it can go before it would backfire.
---
Then again, half the people are kinda forced into working in sweatshops and cheap factories.
---
Is that socialism?
---
That's not been my experience from my co-workers. They have been firmly against the HK protesters. They believe that they are rioting criminals hurting people and destroying property. Many have said their mainland friends who were in HK have fled out of fear and that people who are identified as from the mainland are in danger. Don't shoot the messenger. This is simply what I'm hearing from them. I'm sure there are also many who are pro-HK too.
---
I didn't say I was brave you dumb cunt.   
---
Fuck off with your character assassination bullshit you fucking shill.
---
I may actually be in China next year on business. Tell you what, I f I do, I'll send you a message and let you know my thoughts. I don't want to be prejudiced against any idea without a thorough examination.
---
I appreciate your thoughtfulness in your responses. My concern is that those regimes that whitewash history and control the narrative of what is and is not acceptable to say about a government are in a great position to increase manipulation of the masses as technology advances. My worry is that this will only get worse.
---
I'm sure their government is not a major issue for the vast majority of Chinese citizens. But stifling free thought is never a net positive.
---
Not to mention Blizzard firing two Taiwanese casters essentially just for being on screen (they even tried to duck out of the screen when Blitzchung made his statement). Last we checked Taiwan still has freedom of speech too. Hope they file for wrongful termination and sue the hell out of Blizzard.
---
Not allowed in the EU. They have consumer rights against disabling easy access to cancel things like subscriptions.

This isnt helpping calm things down lol

No, you're mindless.
---
It's not about being a SJW, if you knew me you'd know how against SJW culture I am, but you don't. You're just being a boring contrarian who thinks your viewpoint earns you respect, but realistically you should not support allowing China to censor companies in the west. It's bigger than Blitzchung and your smallmindedness speaks volumes.
---
If you are okay with China telling your country and companies how to act, then your judgement is already questionable, but if you don't draw a line here, then there's nothing to stop them getting braver and imposing their will further.
---
You are mindless. Literally all you see is "lol SJW", when everyone else is seeing a literal invasion of rights from overseas.
---
You are a stupid person, and I won't respond to you further, because you being a contrarian is lame to begin with, but in regards to this particular issue, it's more than lame. It's borderline enablement.
---
No system is the best at everything.
---
Capitalism is great for individual choice, social mobility, and efficiently solving a whole lot of economic problems.
---
It tends to struggle with inequality, 'tragedy of the commons' scenarios with the environment, and in situations where consumers have no choice (healthcare, important services owned by a monopoly, etc.). So, you have to constantly update the rules to avoid exploitation and bad-faith stuff.
---
This is why a lot of nations favor e.g. a market economy for most goods with socialized healthcare, infrastructure, military, etc.
---
You can swap in alternative economic systems but they all have their own problems. Capitalism is great at what its good for, it just-so-happens that it's not the best model for all things at all times.
---
I'd hate to have a strictly-capitalist healthcare system or an unregulated market, but I'd also hate to buy my games and groceries from a planned economy where some bureaucrat tells me what I am allowed to consume and in what quantity.
---
So, no, the trick is not to 'get rid of capitalism', its to update it where we can and to switch models in the cases where capitalism sucks.
---
This needs to be bigger news - China blatantly attacking businesses IN OTHER COUNTRIES that disagree with them.
---
As usual the Australian government will do nothing in response, lest they risk China not buying our ores, and meat any more. I don't normally stick up for Trump, but at least he's doing SOMETHING about China. More countries need to follow America's lead in that regard, and stand up to China.
---
Well, I suppose they could just cut ties with NetEase, exit the Chinese market, cancel *Diablo: Immortal* (co-developed with NetEase), and probably generate an insane amount of goodwill in the West.
---
About a snowball's chance in hell of happening, but I don't think mainland China makes up such a large amount of their revenue that it would be *completely* outlandish.
---
This wasn't for karma. I hate the direction Blizzard is going and was quitting the game anyway, so I decided to do it in public to spread awareness and publicize my taking part in the Blizzard boycott.
---
That means society has problem with morality being changed. Do you have a problem with the fact that slavery is banned now? If you don’t, then would you have a problem if we went back to legalising slavery? How do you determine which one is correct?
---
Morality being subjective isn’t lazy straw man, it is the fundamental idea on which China is operating. It is the foundation on which claims like “you worry about your life, I’ll worry about mine” are established. Blizzard choosing money over morals could be argued to be morally correct decision, depending on your definition of morality. Or are you saying Western morality is superior to eastern morality? It’s starting to sound like Britain invading India for the sake of Christianity’s superior moral values, doesn’t it.

They didn't egg him on. What's the point of spreading misinformation?

The only thing they're guilty of is not stopping him. The casters and producer knew it was going to be said.

The quote "*I don't care about political drama half the world away, I just want a fun game to play on my commute*" is particularly telling.
---
Illegal and subject to heavy fines in the EU. If that affects you folks in the EU, start reporting them.
---
I don't know what the rules are or what the players have been told. And had they have done a slap or the wrist and a fine with the message that they did not want their competition used for as a political platform I would have been accepting of that.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But for them to come down so harshly on the player, especially for the rule they quoted which was very vague, feels to me like they were trying to make an example.
---
You are welcome to feel however you like but personally, I am no longer going to support a company that would act in this manner.
---
Can’t bait someone because of your shitty trolling? /u/fondanoreo has the solution: just write a painfully obvious gaslighting comment pretending like you successfully triggered someone.
---
Um just to chime in whilst were boycotting don't forget that Destiny isn't a part of Activision after bungie split with them so yay go bungie!
---
Yes but they are using Blizzards platform to catapult their message and Blizzard would be basically allowing it. That is not being politically neutral.

You know that all the stuff you're posting about in this tirade applies to the United States, right? Our country was built on atrocities. Our country is still committing atrocities. Yet we all get up and go back to work. We play video games. We relax. We take care of ourselves. When we can, we sacrifice, and we fight back against those atrocities.
---
If you have the power to improve the world, you should do it. But you have to take care of yourself, too. I can't blame people for not just walking away from their livelihoods. Everyone has their limit and I encourage them to fight to better the world with as much power as they can until they reach that limit.

It's easy to sit here on a message board and rant about what other people should do, but it's a lot harder to get off your ass and take action yourself. Protest. Raise money and donate it. Raise awareness with the people you actually have clout with, and not just Reddit. Make a sacrifice.

It's not review bombing if the parent company's behavior actually affects your enjoyment of the game, to the point where you don't feel comfortable playing it.

According to the GDPR in the EU this is illegal to do.

I get the sense you were also there when Firefall died, friend? Curious if I ever played with you - IGN was the same as my Reddit name.

I don't blame anyone who doesn't want to get involved. The way Blizzard is right now is extremely violatile. It's not worth axing your stream over.

Can't assume anymore. Go to any Chinatown in North America and you're just as likely to find someone vehemently pro-CCP as someone anti-CCP. Or look at Hungary and Poland, two countries that should know from their history how awful authoritarianism is and yet tore down their democratic foundations.

---
Their only link to the world is hearthstone?
---
Well, no, actually. The government isn't even allowed to make rules like that because they are too vague to know what they cover. That rule could be used to punish someone for anything. They could take away someone's prize money for wearing a shirt that is red and green because it offended colorblind people. There is no way to know in advance what it covers other than it's completely arbitrary and up to Blizzard's discretion, and they used that discretion to give him the maximum punishment to appease China. This wasn't about rule enforcement, it was about politics and money, plain and simple.
---
Yes. This is the company that runs *Hearthstone* in mainland China. It's also on what is essentially the government-approved social media platform.
---
At this stage though, doing the right thing can't negate the fact they did the wrong thing with full knowledge at the time that it was objectively the wrong thing to do. Hell, the only reason they'd now be trying to do the right thing is because they've realised there are consequences beyond their expectations when they do the wrong thing.
---
Pretty sure that’s the way it’s always been
---
China is astronomically worse than anything the USA or their companies do. Stop the whataboutism. The Chinese are sending in plainsclothes vigilantes to beat citizens, harvesting organs, trying to control or annihilate all religions within their nation and have consistently abused the people of Hong Kong, Tibet and others. They need to be stopped, like across the world MORE people need to bring up the politics of China in "unrelated" areas, there needs to be a grand understanding that if we don't do anything soon they'll not only be doing that shit over there, but they'll continue to exert more and more control over our media in the West.

Because you understand the issue and no one else.
---
Imaging actually convincing yourself that. Imagine then going on to say this is the easiest debate ever, when you're literally not even debating the same thing.
---
You know better than everyone. lmao
---
You're all a bunch of pathetic, weak willed, chicken shit pussies with absolutely zero integrity. The world would be better without you in it! Shame on you for shaming the human race!
---
I didn't get it, except for a link to this post. Damn. Make sure you guys are clicking on the image to boost its presence lol (not sure if that works, though)
---
Here's a report on this year's celebration, if you are interested.

Off the top of my head, 10 million took in the space trade and 10 million from the Congo so with he slave trade and 1 colony we’re at 20 million, that includes non of the other European colonies, many of which enacted genocides and were similarly or even more lethal than king Leopold.
---
I don’t know exact numbers, but I feel pretty safe in ball park guess.
---
we have to support these people if there is fallout for them doing the right thing.   
---
not with words. but jobs and respect.
---
What a brave soldier, God bless your soul
---
See, you're a victim of shit media and the establishment. 
---
He didn't do that, we have a very accurate memo/transcript of the phone call.  Ukraine didn't know the aid was being withheld until more than a month AFTER the phone call took place and it was never brought up on the call.  
---
Please, for the sake of our country, grow up soon.
---
I wouldn't consider a 10 word explanation of Schadenfreude a perfect explanation. You require an understanding of German culture as well.
---
I don't think explanations are sufficient to gain a deep understanding about a culture.
---
That's a long time for such a subreddit actually.
---
This is the cringiest shit I've ever seen
---
The best way is to use Hagatha's Duplatransmogrifier. I'm on my second run and have 24 in my deck. 🤓🤣
---
Wasn’t there a post on this subreddit yesterday with someone playing hearthstone against someone named “FreeHongKong” or something like that?
---
&gt; Protecting their cash as much as they can.
---
These are ultimately human beings making decisions. Very few of them are solely motivated by money.
---
Personal reputation and morals do factor into decisions, even if they often lose out.
---
In America it's okay to quarantine supporters of this regime as it's free speech.
---
In China, that's a fine and mandatory organ re-education.
---
What kind of non-statement is that?
---
You make it sound like AAA games can be a solo developer lifting all the work alone. It is ALWAYS a team effort when it comes to AAA games. And even super small teams like Re-Logic (FTL, Into the Breach) are not one guy doing it all, they have relatives and friends that help them. It's not an isolation job where you close yourself inside a room for 2 years and come back with a product.
---
1) Ehh it seemed pretty clear that was your point
---
2) Not taking the time of day to do that. Like you just pointed out it was another opportunity, as in you're already in a fine spot.
---
I think we all understand the concept of corporate greed, but unlike you I take pity on the employees that feel like riding this shit storm out is their own option.
---
&gt;Well, you're just pulling numbers out of thin air and quoting them as fact
---
It's a fairly well known metric, which, iirc, was confirmed by at least MaRo. But I really am not gonna go over 5 years worth of podcasts and tweets to find it.
---
&gt;I feel like you're just like the people who irrationally hate planeswalkers and don't like that a game you've played for a long time isn't exactly the same as it was when you were young.
---
Well good thing that feelings aren't facts and most of my favorite decks AND formats were all post-planeswalkers. Faeries, Elspeth WW, Miracles, Tin Fins, Death and Taxes, Stoneblade, Delver. All being completely different from how the game looked "when I was young". But thanks for the free psychoanalysis?
---
&gt;It is creative, deep, and with a constantly changing metagame
---
I mean, good for you? Have fun. I personally won't sink money into a game that doesn't know where it's trying to go, has to ban cards in standard over and over again, destroys its own lore, and has whole formats that are completely dominated by a monoculture of decks (Theros, Origins, Innistrad, Tarkir, Kaladesh). And now they want to exploit people with their IRL loot boxes that are even more on the nose than ever, so they can eat a dick for that too.
---
Makes sense that the Middle Kingdom is getting the attention and reverence it deserves.
---
Is the offering rate for class cards in Arena right now very low? I seem to be getting so many neutrals in drafts atm
---
I’m pretty sure he was talking about the company, Blizzard, standing up for human rights. I highly doubt people aren’t deleting their accounts because they think it will keep Hong Kong a free democracy. It’s to make a point that they’re aware Blizzard doesn’t care about people’s human rights, but rather their money.
---
American Gamer pool = 166 million people 
---
China Gamer pool = 660 million people
---
I’m sure you can figure out the rest here...
---
I guess he means as events such as the famine created by Mao Zedong, there's your starter for 15 to 45 million.

---
Exactly. This is what slactivism is all about - making as little effort as possible, letting everyone know what you've done, and patting yourself on the back. Convincing yourself that you've done something good and made a difference. This subreddit is a lemmingfest.
---
Its ceremonial. A way of giving a final fond farewell to what the game once was.
---
Even if it does die they aint getting money from me ever again. They can go fuck themselves after pulling this stunt. Any company that does not like human rights as blizzard does not deserve to be supported.
---
I'm not a kid. And nowhere do I mention "literally shaking"
---
Looks like you're just resorting to quoting and making stuff up.
---
Pretty standard for someone who has got everything else wrong.
---
Just tried from France, it works fine.
---
They just keep digging themselves deeper and deeper into this hole.
---
Fine. Let them crash and burn.
---
xD, yeah...vocal minority rule, just like you people always are. 
---
If I took a poll on reddit that says we should only have 2hr school days... it would overwhelmingly be supported...yet actual level-headed adults would say that's ridiculous.  
---
By the way, I didn't say I was the only one that understand the situation, you just won't find them because they're not on reddit or hearthstone forums...aka emotional kids who can't understand complex situations.
---
Sorry I flaired it
---
If everyone boycotts in light of this to try and send a message though, will it work? What will China be forced to do if US companies actually make a stand and refuse to acquiesce to them?
---
You probably don’t know that these “peaceful protesters“ are smashing stores, attacking citizens whoever disagree with them, and of course attacking police with weapons. I have been studying here for 4 years in HKU and I can tell you normal protests happened so many times every year in hongkong and they were always allowed. But violence like this is not something tolerable.
---
You are awesome. Thanks!
---
Look up China’s dramatic increase in personal debt, the avalanche of international companies trying to grow in China and the growing number of Chinese individuals who are joining the middle class every year. They buy more than you think. For instance, not only is China the U.S. top importer but it’s the third largest exporter of U.S. goods behind Canada and Mexico.  You combine the total trade of China (exports and imports) its roughly 15% of total world trade according to the WTO.
---
They haven’t deleted my HS and battlenet reviews on the AppStore
---
saying that because blizzard upholds their regulations on the "no politics" rule they don't care about human rights is a bit of a jump to make.
---
did you destroy everything you own that was made in china?
---
you won't because you don't want to take any financial risks, let's be real.
---
How did you post this then?!
---
Guys we found the modern day dave duke
---
Yeah, this is true. It's understandable that Blizz would want to keep their platform free of politics...but the rule itself is just extremely severe and crippling.
---
Which our governments should have started disallowing in the 90s or early 00s already. That's my point.
---
Our economies and corporations should have never been allowed to become reliant on fascist regimes' goodwill.
---
It’s... an empty loot box
---
Umm that looks fine IMO.
---
So far it's the closest we have to an official statement from Blizzard.
---
It's sad that so much of this thread is being overlooked so people can spout anti-Mark stuff. Do you guys really want his message to be passed over just because you don't like the guy? I thought we were all pro Hong Kong, but I guess it's only if people we like are?
---
Nice, but I think mine is better:
---
They targeted gamers.
---
Gamers.
---
We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.
---
We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.
---
We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.
---
Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.
---
Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?
---
These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us Hong Kong apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.
---
Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.
---
I was mocking this with the "literally shaking"....wasn't hard to figure out. 
---
&gt;  I actually feel guilty about the idea of logging in to their game.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but it seems to occur if you havent downloaded all the assets on mobile, prior to entering the tavern
---
If /r/incel is banned, so should /r/sino. Both do not belong in this platform
---
Nuts, I was offered a BFF in my first run but wasn't sure what it did, so I didn't choose it. Now I have to go back and see if i can get it again.
---
No answer for the other guy who replied, eh?
---
Then why does every nation value human rights differently?
---
In fact many of the other enterprise forms created since 1980 are “mutations of SOEs. Of the 6000 or so shareholding companies, 1300 of the largest are listed on the Chinese or foreign stock markets. About 80 per cent of these have their genesis in SOEs, or are spin-offs or offshoots of SOE holding companies, and remain majority government owned. Over 80 per cent of the joint ownership enterprises involve a state body, being either ‘state joint ownership’ or ‘ state-collective joint ownership.’ Some of the limited liability companies’ corporations are solely state funded. A goodly percentage of the foreign funded firms are joint or cooperative ventures with an SOE or a collective. Collectives are themselves a related, but distinct kin, of an SOE in that they are controlled by lower government tiers at the county or urban level. If we ignore the collectives, the state-holding enterprises in 2002 numbered 41,125 (23 per cent of the total) and contributed 41 per cent of industry output. Adding to these figures those of the collectives (36,670) and collective joint ownership enterprises (576) brings the number of enterprises to 79,341 (44 per cent of the total) accounting for 53 per cent of industry gross output.” (p10-11 Chiu and Lewis.)
---
“In 2001, for example, the state owned units accounted for 47 per cent of fixed asset investment. SOEs by virtue of their dominance of heavy industry and the capital-intensive sectors of the economy still provide the basic productive inputs on which other sectors rely, and for this reason can be considered to occupy a key position in Chinese manufacturing.” (p9 Reforming China’s State Owned Industries and Banks. Chiu and Lewis 2006.)

---
“State owned units account for 32 per cent of urban employment, in the North East of China they account for 70 per cent of GDP. Heavy industry is dominated by state owned enterprises and the bulk of technology is concentrated in these enterprises. Much of the decline of SOEs is due to their transformation in form. The state sector includes many shareholding companies, joint ownership companies, limited liability companies, foreign funded enterprises, collectives and township and village enterprises. In total state owned enterprises account for over half of industrial output.”

I.... uhmm... started an EA game without having a funny feeling.
---
Incorrect flair.
---
&gt; !remindme 1 month
---
Very true, so many political agenda that is forced in Blizzard games. Game is game,I hate them so much for pushing non-sense shits to games.
---
Blitzchung didn't smash stores, nor did he attack anyone.  He said 8 words.
---
8 words cannot be viewed as anything more than a reasonable protest.  We don't punish people for the actions of others.
---
Less powerful and more publicity stunt.
---
Because there's profit in withholding them lol
---
Dream Quest and Slay the Spire.

---
&gt;"The director only told me I have an interview," the 26-year-old Taiwanese caster said. "He didn’t talk about how he’s wearing a mask, so when the interview started, I wasn't sure what the situation was. So I thought that Chung could just say what he wanted to say." 
---
The fact that the production apparently already knew that Blitzchung was wearing a gas mask and didn't bother to warn the casters means that the production is either idiots or equally at fault. Blizzard should've cut the feed once they saw the mask, not let the interview go and blame the casters after the fact.
---
Goddammit blizz I was really looking forward to kibler casting 😭
---
But after they banned and stripped his prize money.
---
Definitely "somewhat" misleading, as it doesn't detract from the garbage to be honest.
---
Yeah, this is a geopolitical global economical issue. Which is why I find it so amazing that blizzard is taking the heat. I mean this got more upvotes in world news than actual Hong Kong atrocities.
---
It's honestly astonishing that all of you need to be told not to bring politics at work. Grow up and quit the controversy bullshit.
---
Blizzard is the bad guy. They takes YEARS to ban people for breaking the same ToS but as soon as their bottom dollar is put in jeopardy they instantly take action and do so in a way that is so over the top that the only explanation is that they are sending China a message.
---
What am I lookin at here...
---
Standing for things that are right sometimes require great sacrifice. Often times by a small minority. 
---
Blizzard for example could take a stand against what China is doing in HK and it would have a much bigger impact than a rando from nowhere usa making the same statement. However Blizzard also has so much more to lose by doing it. So they chose, to protect its margins. That's disgusting. 
---
People profiting off blizzard are in the same delima. They have a powerful stage they could use to condemn blizzard, and China by default, but run the risk of losing a lot. So I expect most will do what blizzard did, protect thier margins. 
---
This is why we have the world we do. Good people sit around and choose personal safety over taking a stand.
---
Sure it's easy for me to say as I have nothing at risk because I lack the stage. I would certainly hope if I was in thier shoes I would choose what's right not what's best for me.
---
I imagine this is what will spark the class action lawsuit
---
To play devils advocate, would you be ok if people could say pro-Chinese propaganda on the broadcast with no repercussions?
---
These tweets are more about himself than about the boycott. What a shameless person...
---
I’m more of a skeptic than a cynic. 
---
Hope for the best, expect the worst.
---
You’re right, forum rage will not lead to anything impactful, that’s kind of my point.
---
If whatever was started here on Reddit in the last few days, ends on Reddit, it will be for nothing.

My family is from China, and this is purely from my personal experience, but I think you're exaggerating. Everyone understands that cheating is wrong. No one celebrates cheating. Watch any Chinese TV show aimed at kids and you'll see a episode about how cheating is wrong. Watch any Chinese TV show aimed at adults and the villains are all demonized for doing horrible things to win. Chinese people know that cheating is a bad thing and winning isn't everything. 
---
The thing is that government institutions and schools are all so corrupt, and the college entrance exams are so critical, even the most highly talented kids all but have no choice to cheat alongside the rich cheaters. That's why so many people in China cheat, not some cultural deficiency, but because of the reality of a society where the rich and powerful constantly cheat and get away with it.
---
You gotta love how people delete their comments once people point out how stupid they are.
---
Never did I expect to see Slasher on Fox News.

There, now you can stop making cancer posts.
---
Wrong time for this, you could adapt it pretty easily though, zephyr can be China and Tirion blizzard, boom, now its good.
---
Just stop dude, if you don’t know the provisions of the bill. It covers only limited range of offences with exceptions of 9 items. 
---
And peaceful protests won’t destroy metro stations and hurt civilians. It’s literally terrorism if you look it up for definition. China never said protests are not allowed 😂
---
Same boat as you my friend! Been playing Blizzard games since the 90s, but I cannot support a company that has bullied ours for so long. I've uninstalled everything and refuse to buy anything going forward. 
---
Mabuhay ang Pilipinas!
---
This would be hilarious if it wasn't so fucking embarrassing. 
---
If blizzard agrees to ban the jews from buying shit in nazi Germany so they can sell in nazi germany, they are applying local standards to sell there.
---
If blizzard agrees to silence free speech in china so they can sell in China, they are doing the same.
---
So either you are saying that old analogy blizzard was "just doing what is needed to influence Germany", or your claim that "blizz is nazi Germany" means you believe current modern blizz "is authoritarian China".
---
My god, just give it up and go play your beloved video games and give it up. You're getting stupider and more inconsistent by the response.
---
It must be nice to have that kind of financial freedom. Many people do not.
---
I'm not talking about the protesters, I'm talking about the people that this community thinks they "own" people like Kibler, Kripp, Frodan, etc. 
---
People in this sub have been asking everyone involved to voice and opinion, and they have the right to not do it publicly. 
---
&gt; If you aren't incensed by what's happening in Hong Kong, perhaps you haven't taken a good hard look at how good you have it.
---
I live in country where every 10 years there's an economic crisis. In 2001 there was a huge gathering of people protesting the government, a guy was shot and killed less than 100 meters from where I stood, tear gas and rubber bullets flied everywhere.
---
Why would you assume "how good I have it"? 
---
You know who does that? What kind of people just assume and act because they think they know what's best?
---
Do you really think your "way" is tolerance? You have no idea what you are saying. 
---
Empathy? Motherfucker, you've never even heard that word.
---
You speak as if authoritarian regimes are the opposite of democracy.  News flash:  all dictators rose with massive population support.  People WILLINGLY allowed dictators to rise.  ie dictators are the product of democracy.

So we got a buff to the already most played deck (Quest Shaman), buffs to other already strong decks (Highlander Hunter, Malygos Quest Druid) and buffs to "sleeper" OP decks (Quest Pally and Priest).
---
How does this help everyone? Do you think just slapping Sylv, Rag and N'Zoth into any deck will just make any deck better? Are you retarded or something?
---
You will have to craft the decks that utilize the "f2p" cards the best. Do you think they just give out cards to make everyone competitive? Did I already ask you, if you are retarded or something? 
---
Some people...
---
I almost started dusting then I realized if I did that then got back into hearthstone down the road I'd end up being more inclined to buy packs.. 
---
So now I'm committing to not buying the new bundles or anything else
---
I also uninstalled the game and then realized I do not have the spine to go that far with it
---
When we help liberate Hong Kong and deal with China, we're coming for you next ya scum... Start running.
---
You really can't see the irony, right? 
---
You are worse that I imagined.
---
Yeah, firing the casters is where this goes from an unfortunate forcing of Blizzard's hand to a ridiculous over-reaction. I'm convinced they were over-compensating because they were worried China would be mad at them for even allowing this to happen.
---
Even Blizzard employees are upset with this decision. It's not their fault, its the higher ups and their corporate greed that caused this PR madness. Blizzard makes great games, lots of people play them because they love to. You do penalize yourself if you boycott a game you enjoyed playing. Let there be a statement but let's do this the smart way.

I picked priest and got stargazing and surrender to madness. Two free 3/3 deathrattles each turn.
---
Blizzard is a part of this whether they like it or not. Staying neutral out of fear of losing money isnt a respectable position, and it is NOT the same as dropping someone for saying racist shit.
---
If they hadnt of done anything both china and blozzard wouldnt be dealing with this in the first place so the whole thing is just stupid.
---
This explains why I couldn't do that yesterday...
---
Also that is total bullshit
---
On the Americas server, in the forums, there are at least 6 "FreeHongKong" battletags when I use the search function.  Also, one poster with the name mentioned they changed it to FreeHongKong because they couldn't request a deletion of their account without photo id.  They thought changing their name to FreeHongKong would incentify Blizzard to delete the account.
---
So yeah, the policy must have changed.
---
What about DURING the ceremony?
---
4th on incognito.
---
Yes.
---
What makes you think that?
---
Nice I had 20 bff’s so that happened
---
Gods Unchained.
---
How can they do that? What if you were a pro-HK t shirt under your hoodie and take it off afterwards? They cannot do anything to limit free speech at Blizzcon
---
Kripp is consistent, more consistent than just about anyone other than Thjis. His view count is consistently predictable and even though it fluctuates with large updates and releases that is also predictable. His Youtube channel has consistently hovered around 960,000 subs for at least a year now and the view counts of those videos are probably also extremely consistent.
---
He has consistently streamed Hearthstone since its release and has built his wealth almost entirely off of the game. He has taking that average wealth and probably adjusted his living standards to that average. I don't know his overhead and I don't know how much he has saved but I do know that he can most likely accurately predict his yearly income due to his consistency and average view counts which come almost entirely feom hearthstone.
---
If he were to move on hearthstone his view count would undoubtedly drop, maybe forever but definitely for a few months at the least. His youtube subscribers would drop and so would his number of views. Maybe he has enough saved up to support that, maybe he already has planned out how much longer he needs to stream and save up to be able to comfortably retire, maybe he's spending money hand over fist (most unlikely)  and assumes that the money will continue to come in a consistent and predictable basis. 
---
I said a whole lot of nothing just to say this: he knows how much money he makes and will make with hearthstone, he can't know that if he switches to another game untill he had done it long enough to get good metrics. Even though he's most likely rich, a large sudden drop in income can put almost anyone in a bad spot with very few exceptions.
---
There used to be a lot more Cantonese and Taiwanese immigrants than mainlanders, but they've become outnumbered over the last ~30 years. It's why American-style Chinese food is more like Cantonese food than mainland stuff.
---
I kindly request that reconsider your morals and how important this video game is to your life
---
Yeah that makes sense
---
I still don't understand why punishment should be given out for him supporting freedom and democracy... Something Blizzard as a company believes in correct?
---
I think you're still not reading it correctly. From 2016. the Asia Pacific region saw a decline of 2 percent, followed by a 6% increase the next year.
---
The Americas increased 5% one year, then 8% the next year. This is larger growth in both years. It's also three time the size.
---
You may be able to argue there's a larger potential audience that is untapped in the Asia Pacific region, but that's speculating further than the 3 year sales.
---
I don't know if you saw, but Blizzard removed all ways to delete your account except showing formal ID for your email, which I wasn't prepared to do, and there are multiple testimonies from people who submitted clear IDs that their request was denied. It's bullshit, but there isn't much else to be done. This was the most permanent thing I could do besides that.
---
Oh look, another person offended by others actually giving a shit about people.
---
This is just a blatant lie. It’s extremely simply to cancel a wow subscription and takes no time at all. You are either being dishonest or a moron.
---
Except that it is a gross misrepresentation of the facts. See topdangle's response for details.
---
No. Just no. Blizzard wasn't enforcing any kind of political neutrality. The scorched earth policy applied here came straight out of the old Soviet play book. The goal is not to punish the original transgression; it's to intimidate. It's to make an example of and to demonstrate what happens to those who don't fall in line. It's to send a clear message they have the power to absolutely ruin you. Whether Blizzard was acting on behalf of the Chinese government or trying to appease them is not for me to say, but it's not political neutrality they were after.
---
And the smart way according to you is to continue to give them money while you pretend you care.
---
You talk about greed and encourage people to give them money - and say it’s the smart way.
---
This is ridiculous. What does blizzard employees being upset have to do with any of what I or you said?
---
I mean, it's pretty close to Andrew, which is pretty common.
---
&gt;I can tell from experience. EU is becoming less and less secure. But it really depends on the country. In switzerland is where I felt safest (even though locals apparently still were scared, it's all a matter of perspective).
---
Fucking lol.
---
Blizzard is in such a tight spot right now on the International stage that I'm not sure what if there is anything they can do to repair their image... what ever it is if its seen as enough will surely bring the ire of China and their future investment in that space. China doesn't give a fuck about Blizzard either. They can just ban them and have it be no sweat of their back.
---
Yes. Blizzard is in a tough spot. And a lot of it is because their first move was so extreme there's no going back from it now.
---
everyone going has already bought tickets, booked flights, and hotels, most of that is non-refundable. I personally am still waiting to see Blizzard's response, and if I don't like it, will just make it a trip to Anaheim and join any groups outside that protest, I will not set foot inside if they do not right this.
---
 (Sits down with a bowl of popcorn) "I'm just here to watch the train wreck."
---
Real classy threatening a stranger online mate.
---
You're a joke.
---
You don't want people to voice support for Human rights because that might cause riots? They hell?
---
Gotta love German as well.
---
LOL. What China is doing to Hong Kong? it’s own territory? It’s like claiming the US is destroying California, does it make any sense?
---
You dont have a clue what you are talking about or even understand the difference between legality and being sued. Ask Dr. Tisha Rowe about American Airlines and how they handled her wearing a crop top on a plane. The fact that you think companies get to dictate what is offensive or not after selling you a service is exactly the problem.
---
No one is making sense in these threads anymore. This is a blizz hate sub for now.
---
Yikes, they just posted about how they think China is doing the right thing in another subreddit.
---
Withholding prize money might not have really been a real choice for blizzard if there is no account to wire it to. If anything, the Chinese government would’ve seized it anyway.
---
For all we know, he’ll be paid down the road, and the “withholding” is a smoke screen for the Chinese government so the kid can get his money later on.
---
Seriously, would make sense. Sometimes I really think people don’t understand what communism is and how nasty it is or can be to it’s constituents.
---
I put in a couple hundred to the game only a few days ago, which was before the recent ruling. It sucks that I won’t be able to make use of what I just spent but I will join in the boycott of Blizzard.
---
It’s less about that and more about how edgy it is to sit on the sideline and call everyone’s reactions fake.
---
But Blizzard is also doing wrong. We are ALSO against that.
---
You earned my dearest respect, best of luck dude
---
Kripp did great before HS. If it died tomorrow he'd do fine with whatever he moved to.
---
This is like saying that because no single company caused the problem or is in a position to solve it, we should never hold any individual company to our standards unless we hold all of them to the standard at the same time. This is a ridiculous premise. Taking this logic to its natural end point would have no one protest any behavior of this kind ever. And that's not how shifting company priorities or cultural expectations works. 
---
Also keep in mind that other companies can be affected by our decisions here with Blizzard even they are not being directly targeted by their consumers. Just as companies operating in China see the position Blizzard is in right now and circumscribe their behavior - continuing to self-censor - so too may companies see the standard we are holding blizzard to and prepare accordingly.
---
Other companies *are* in a similar position, this is true, and if and when they engage in behavior like Blizzard's, feel free to boycott them as well.
---
Definitely feel this, I used to play every day, even on lunch breaks occasionally.. but after everything thats happened I feel uneasy thinking about opening it. Knowing that I've been supporting blizzard products all this time has me kicking myself for ever starting. I hope this all doesnt get swept under the rug. 
---
Really opened my eyes to how deep the corruption is; that so many things are being affected by the Hong kong protests and the government trying to silence all the voices worries me.. They produce so many things (china) and I wonder if anyone in my own town even understand what they re supporting by consuming chinese products...I wondered why coffee beans here were "conflict free", when in reality everything should be conflict free.. Hong Kong isnt HK without its people! So why wont we listen to Hong Kong and put our support where it damn well should be!! Jeez.  
---
If only everyone understood, how loud our voice was together.
---
Whatever happened to companies just putting out a disclaimer that they do not share or support the views of their players/consumers/participants? Instead, now we have to censor ourselves so they can make a profit? Yeah, nah...
---
No problem
---
Post headline is a lie.  Blizzard does not operate in China.  They partner with Chinese companies who brings Blizzard's products to China.  
---
Blizzard hasn't made a response yet.  They either have a response ready and are waiting for things to calm down, or they haven't yet decided on what to do.
---
Feel the hatred of 1000 YEARS!!!
---
The official wording is they would let them cast any more games in the future, or something like that. I believe what you suppose is correct.
---
If you compare Putin and PIS they are basically doing the same thing, just in Poland they are a decade or two behind. Paint opposition as foreign agents and traitors, paint protests as paid actors, say that all opposing media are betrayign national interest, introduce huge social spending to make sure people support you in the meantime.
---
And sadly it's working very well. They couldn't have started in the better time, economy is great so people are buying it.
---
&gt;He's an avowed GamerGater.
---
Just imagine posting this in 2019 like it means anything to anybody.
---
Reminds me of [this](https://youtu.be/eE_msAKWdOs?t=164)
---
I mean, is it odd to like blizzard games but be unhappy enough with this decision that you would ask a pertinent political question in an open forum?
---
Oh, Heavens to Betsy!
---
[R/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM/)
---
Blizzard: I felt a great disturbance in the community as if millions of accounts suddenly cried out in anger and were suddenly cancelled. I fear we done goofed.
---
I wouldn’t call it a *gross* misrepresentation of the facts.  Blizzards obligation as a publicly traded company is to make money, China is a gigantic market for them.  It’s that simple.  I do agree, however, that they could have handled this **very** differently.
---
Could you elaborate ?
---
Noice
---
I mean that's fine but MtG has such an insane volume of lore (being a game that has literally existed for over a quarter of a century) that there really is something for everyone. I for one don't love some of the new story arcs, but the older stuff is incredible.
---
That's the gamble. Do you lose more from China due to the statement or from not-China from the backlash to the response?
---
Activision/Blizzard is a for profit company. That's what matters to them, profit. Nothing else. They made their bet, let's see how it turns out.
---
" and maybe doesn’t support communism "  
---
In the current world we live in, you are simply asking too much.   
---
Joking aside, if you want another card game there is The Elder Scroll Legends, Magic The Gathering Online, Gwent and many others. They all require some brain power, so just check them out. I'm recently playing hell out of newest Anno 1800 and Ubisoft actually spoke on that matter, claiming they are not supporting communism, so it may be a win-win on both sides.
---
Blizzard used to one of the most respected gaming companies out there. Shame to see how far they've fallen.
---
Rather than a video with a timestamp, can you please provide the text?
---
Mark was never gonna get Chinese money for ember in the first place after he burned the last investors. His game is already destined to fail - he's desperately hoping to leech goodwill here.
---
It WAS clear before. A lot of the same stuff is being said. Nobody bought “blizzard standards” when it happened.
---
They sure can.  Most people here in the states throw around free speech like its something it isn't.
---
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
---
That is the first amendment.
---
It doesn't mean that a business has to allow you to say what you want on their platform or on their event.
---
Blizzard can absolutely ban you from wearing a specific t-shirt, and search you to enforce that.  And while such a search might be invasive, they aren't the police.  You don't have to go.  You don't have to consent to being searched, but they don't have to let you enter.
---
Now, whether they want to deal with that logistically, or from a PR perspective, that is its own debate.
---
Yes
---
&gt; (being a game that has literally existed for over a quarter of a century)
---
I know, I started playing in 1995 shortly after the release of 4th Ed.
---
When has "we didn't ban you for X it was actually Y" not been bullshit tho?
---
If we can convince that many!
---
SPAM 🍆 THIS 🍆 DONG 🍆TO 🍆 HELP 🍆 HONG 🍆 KONG
---
Netease's revenues from WoW/Hearthstone/etc is simply not included in Blizzard's APAC revenue. I'm not sure how much clearer than that I can make it, but you just have to look at the numbers to see that they obviously cannot include China.
---
I think they’re just trolling.
---
Crimea was invaded in 2014, Obama left office in 2017.
---
I upvoted it because it's clearly a joke at the expense of how fickle the American consumer is. As well as how prone they are to slactivist causes and get caught up in a frenzy that they let fade away after newscycle. There will be a lot of people that will regret their decision to throw away thousands of dollars worth of money and even more thousands of dollars worth of time. Not all but plenty.
---
You don’t have to. It’s just a possible reason was given for this particular mishap. That no foul play was intended.
---
Why do we have to settle for a reformed capitalism? Why not create a new economic system, that focuses on people and their happiness instead of obscene profits for the very wealthy? And if we do make a system like this, why call it capitalism at all?
---
Wait, I’m lost on the nba situation. Last I heard they backpeddled and got banned?
---
What do you think would happen to their share price if China blocked their products?
---
Ok maybe, I never cared enough about these topics to notice anything. I always just watched what I like.
---
My battletag is LiberateHK and I won't change it.
---
Oh! Got your point! Yeah, that may be true
---
I appreciate your dedication to the community, not the company!
---
I'm glad it takes more than just an email and my password to delete my account that I have tens of thousands of hours in.
---
More security is a good thing, not a bad thing.
---
I don’t think it’s the shoe they’re sucking on.
---
I was so deep into classic wow. But now I can't. Bye blued out level 60 Hunter :(.
---
Yeah people in the right stand up and probably would lose their job oppurtunity standing for human rights and you made a meme out of it.
---
Trash.
---
It's Netease's Hearthstone account.
---
Do you know how these streamers make their money? From us. Us watching their streams, subscribing to their channel or donating with our money. 
---
Like our politicians who are paid with our taxes, they are in a way accountable to us. If we don’t support their stance on something like human rights or free speech issues, we don’t have to support them with our wallets anymore. Anyone who loves capitalism so much should appreciate that argument. 
---
All of the streamers you mentioned have the power to pressure the company to change their position. There are times in history where people no longer get to just put their head down and ignore the political conversation happening around them.
---
More CCG promotion to capitalize on the shitstorm.
---
You don't need to be left to dislike grand scale human rights abuses, or right to dislike China.
---
I think blizzard should move ALL operations to China
---
Can seriously nobody read?  The image in the post is "you have tried too many times".  I would get the same shit if I tried to sign into Amazon with the wrong password enough times, doesn't mean they're "disabling people logging in"
---
That was it (to my knowledge). Never heard of anyone getting denied service or treated poorly for their sexuality. I think it’s backwards, sad, and harmful to view LGBTQ people as inherently broken/sinful, but I will still support a private organization’s right to voice that belief. And if their product is good, I’ll keep doing business with them.
---
Can you tell me where you WERE during these alleged rapes, murders, and illegal drug deals?
---
Because by your logic... Oh wait...
---
&gt;Rescinding prize money and banning Blitzchung for year was waaay too harsh
---
Taking back the prize money, at least, was a punishment written in the rules. He knew this would be the penalty.
---
So? If they don't fix it in time then they can get into trouble anyways.
---
Listen, I'm just some 23 year old guy, I don't have all the answers, I just have my opinion &amp; that's what I've stated.
---
&gt;It offends China.
---
SO DOES ALL OF THIS:

---
***That last English phrase is very important here because it's the main crux of my argument: The insane people running China are fucking ridiculous!*** 
---
I'm sorry for these two exclamatory bits in a row but just... I can't accept your argument at all, when saying "Well China doesn't like X..." just seems so, well, stupid! When a copypasta gets an entire site blacklisted in a country, right, maybe it's not worth listening to that country when they get """"""offended"""""".
---
Unless I've missed something, Donald Trump hasn't gotten upset over every single meme or joke or whatever equating HIM to orange things. Oompa-Loompas, Cheetohs, the actual orange fruit, whatever! He hasn't BANNED the fucking word "Oompa-Loompa" because his skin is closer to an orange tint! The closest thing to the China situation is that ban on memes in Russia. The other place that's just... Oh, such a bastion of free thought and peace and human rights.
---
I'll just make my point clear in case the above wasn't enough: Fuck worrying about "offending China"! Their leaders are tools! They're getting bent out of shape over their leader BEING EQUATED TO A CARTOON CHARACTER! If they get pissy over that, how can you honestly tell me with a straight face that what they consider "problematic" is genuinely worth considering?
---
Here, go to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfjldg/comment/f33icay). Look at all the shit that's happened because of things China didn't like, or that they want more of. You're telling me every thing on that list is reasonable? "We don't like black people, we won't go to movies with them featured prominently." "We won't use your service if you imply that Taiwan and Hong Kong deserve independence." "Get rid of your employee who liked a Tweet made by a Tibetan group."
---
I'm not trying to make this "What-aboutism", I'm presenting a case for why no-one should take China seriously when they say they're offended. The leaders want everyone to do things their way, and they aim to keep their people under their control through propaganda and censorship. They forbid talk of Hong Kong and independence and comparisons between their primary leader and Winnie the Pooh because they don't want to be left weakened. Their control only lasts so long as the populace remains brainwashed and ignorant.
---
So overall, yeah. I apologize if I go into repeating myself. But unless you'd like to DEFEND China as a country and their actions, it's hard to accept the notion that them "being offended" is believable and okay. There is just SO MUCH they could end up "being offended" by, that acting like they only get upset over truly egregious matters is a disservice to all the other countries out there that at least try to be 
---
decent to their people.
---
Finally, on the "real-life issues" thing. I'm uh. Not quite sure where that starts or ends to be frank with you. Do you just mean literal issues, as in topics, and not so much stuff like disaster relief efforts? Because even if that's the case, while I respect your opinion on the matter, it's like... I dunno how far that should be taken.
---
You say "I don't play games or watch games to be reminded about real life issues" but I saw people talking about Dems and Reps in WoW multiple times over the course of months and even a year at one point! So should any political talk just be forbidden in any sort of entertainment? Where do you want to draw the line? I'm not trying to make this slippery slope, I'm wondering where "politicizing a platform" starts and stops. To go back to what I said above: Would wearing a shirt with Winnie the Pooh on it be considered "politicizing the platform"? In general, what if someone has a shirt or some sort of icon or phrase on their person that reflects a political... Thing? Or the person doesn't do anything political on the platform but they're very openly political on other platforms? I'm just wondering where you draw the lines because I'm pretty sure I can think of cases where this logic falls apart fairly easily.
---
Hello, fellow elitist jerk.  If you didn't spend much time theory crafting mage DPS then we probably never crossed paths, but howdy all the same.
---
All of it, and then more.
---
China has more than 2 times the population of all North-America, a huge PC-Bang culture and a HUGE pay-to-win culture.
---
Right now they aren't as popular in China vs the US, but there is A LOT of room to grow where here probably every gamer has bought a Blizzard game in their lifetime.
---
Took me like 5 minutes when I've done it before.
---
I think they meant blizzards side, not China.  Think about it, its a lose lose situation for blizzard.  Either they have the west pissed cause they punished him or the east pissed because they didnt.  (I dont condone what they did, just playing devils advocate)
---
That's why it's disgusting.
---
This is Blizzard's stance, until they state otherwise.
---
Check the year graph, everyone sees a tiny drop and freaks out, this is nothing. It’ll be right back up in a week or two.
---
I’d like to see them die, but seriously, short term share drops aren’t anything compares to 5% of the company being owned.
---
inb4 “nOt tHe tImE”
---
This is what I feel right now. I probably would've quit already if I didn't have real life friends that played as well, one of whom is an international student from china. I'm also playing in tespa with some of these friends with a pretty good record so far, and that's holding me back too
---
I can't play the game with good conscience anymore but I can't really just stop either. If nothing changes, I'll probably be out by december.
---
The bit with Riot Games turned in to just a misunderstanding. With Blizzard having been fresh on everyone's minds, they themselves were unsure of if they should be mentioning anything of Honk Kong as Riot officials had not talked to them about it. Riot says they approve of anyone wanting to mention anything about Hong Kong or something like that during their events.
---
What are you talking about?  He randomly brought up child trafficking for no reason lol
---
Just quit bro. 
---
#LiberateHongKong
---
They banned him, then stripped him of his winnings and fired the casters.  I don't think a player's contract would include firing people next to him.  Call me crazy.
---
I don’t think there’s any danger. Even the smallest amount of publicity from people without  the proper attitude isn’t bad. Support was never harmful
---
I don't play Hearthstone, let alone any other pc games except maybe Civilization 5 and don't plan to, but you and me both buddy. _enjoys sip of whiskey while watching China fail to achieve cultural victory_

Just quit.

---
Wasnt banned for breaking the rules? Are you fucking blind?If Blitchung said "fuck the niggas" he will be banned too for "breaking the rules" and what you gonna do? Probably you guys wont say anything about it right? You are doing this just because it's China,"the biggest threat to the world",Double standard basterds.
---
If China cut all ties without external culture, would their population still be appeased by having more wealth than they used to?
---
I encourage boycotting netease. With this revelation, boycotting the American side feels like shooting ourselves in the foot. You want them to stop their nonsense. Stop letting that Chinese company earn USD. Plus they produce a ton of crap f2p games.
---
And neither do the thousands of other companies that have a large number of their profits coming from China. All of which try to maintain a non political stance. You are focused on making the blizzard the fall guy when it’s just a symptom, not the disease. It does nothing to address the actual problem. Doesn’t weaken the CCP at all. Doesn’t help the Hong Kong protestors. 
---
The hearthstone player was brave, but I think would have been better off voicing his political views on Twitter/twitch/YouTube and then donating the grandmaster winnings to pro Hong Kong liberation groups. Would keep China as the enemy and provide financial support for the protestors. Would keep the 1000s of American blizzard employees (not talking about upper management) that aren’t pro China, just trying to make a living, a job. Instead now public enemy number one is blizzard and Pooh bear is drinking tea laughing. Just my opinion based on what I’ve seen from similar controversies.
---
No one cared in the little echo bubble you keep yourself in maybe.
---
If you are wondering how, one relic makes all cards this turn cost 0 but are removed from your adventure deck.  So obviously I played that with card draw in hand. The helpful orb dude duplicated a Rotten Appebaum 4 times plus I drew a Scalebane and one 2/2. So basically I killed his first wave in 3 turns, then scalebane buffed one guy so much he did 17 in one hit. That said I would have died with the opponent at one health last game but the other healed me for 20, then I topdecked lethal. Hilarious run
---
They banned a OWL player for saying “suck my dick”.
---
They’ve done stupid crap before.
---
They'll probably just have PLA troops stationed at  the gates of the convention center, bone saws and black hoods at the ready to whisk away any bourgeois undesirables who bring disharmony to the glorious Peoples' Republic and redistribute their organs for the greater good
---
We love you Brian!
---
Same thing, the new data protection laws write this as illegal. If a person wishes for a company to completely and permanently delete everything that company has in their name, it's their right to request it's deletion. That includes, in this case, were I to message Blizzard and ask them to delete my account. They should delete my account, and it should be as though I never had one, had no prior purchases, etc. There are safeguards in place for things like "My account got banned, please forget me so I can have my username back" however.
---
Perhaps that is the effect here, but this is a fairly cynical take on what I really tried to make an earnestly-written post.
---
Some-BODY once told me...!
---
I have to say, I think this is a coincidence. Stuff like this just isn't put together and published that fast. Maybe I'm wrong.
---
sorry if it was unclear, anyways I’m glad blizzard is getting all this shit now, hopefully other companies get what they deserve too. Fuck the ccp and those who support them
---
**LITERALLY 5 HOURS!!!**
---
What about him?
---
I mean, to be fair to Blizzard, "Free Hong Kong" is extremely offensive.  Can you imagine?  A city of *free* men and women?  I shudder to think!  There are millions of people in Hong Kong, what, do you just want to give them *rights* and *freedoms*?  Terrifying. 
---
Next you'll be telling me something crazy, like Tibet exists.
---
Do you not know what an emulator is?
---
Holy shit I'm finally seeing some Hearthstone posts
---
Shadowverse is a great game
---
Gods Unchained is similar to Hearthstone, and the company gifted the banned Hearthstone player all of the money that he had taken from him by Blizzard.

Damn, I was hoping I was missing something and just simplifying things, but that does look like a lot of leftist opposition would just condone these Chinese-style tactics if it was about shutting up Republicans rather than HK protesters.
---
I hope that's not a prelude for a near future if they'd ever get into power.
---
Second point normally responses to a 2), so I think you meant my comment about corporate greed? I don't think a story about Blizzard's employees feeling stuck in their jobs would make it to the mainstream media, but okay man.
---
You literally did though
---
You have to pay to change your legal name in your account details? Fuck those who get married I guess.
---
Losing my access to a video game for my believe in human rights is not drastic at all, actually.
---
Marx looked at history and decided that every revolution that happened in the past had the middle-class take advantage of the working-class to overthrow the ruling-class. The ruling class would become the new middle-class, and the cycle would begin anew. So Karl thought that the proletariat has to overthrow the ruling class. Being inherently more virtuous than the (former) ruling class or the middle-class, the working-class will give up their power and everyone lives happily ever after in a stateless society.
---
This is an incredibly stupid idea. By Marx's own reasoning, the proletariat would just become the new ruling class and a new cycle would begin. 
---
Also, part of Communism's lovely little piece of ideology is that the State would produce just enough that each individual gets just as much as they need. So what happens if one factory has a broken part and suddenly the State can't make enough for each person? What if someone breaks theirs and needs a new one? What if someone's just an asshole and takes two or three?
---
Under Capitalism, you have plenty. Under Communism, you have scarcity.
---
So, no, I don't just see that EVERY SINGLE ATTEMPTED COMMUNIST STATE HAS ENDED IN REPRESSIVE DICTATORSHIPS (though, really, that should be enough evidence for anyone with a thinking mind), I also see that Communism is just a bad ideology that needs to be relegated to the dustbin of history. Also, if Communism had been tried one or two times, then you can say "but REAL COMMUNISM HASN'T BEEN TRIED YET!" All of the former Soviet Socialist Republics, Cuba, China, Vietnam, the Communist rebels in South America (like FARC), the Communist rebels in Africa (like the MPLA), the IRA, the Red Brigades in Italy, the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, some of the Basque terrorists in Spain, the Baader-Meinhof Gang of West Germany, the NPA of the Phillipines, and dozens more are all violent, atrocity-laden nightmares. And yet, for some God-forsaken reason, people actually want that here?
---
No thank you. DEATH IS A PREFERABLE ALTERNATIVE TO COMMUNISM!
---
This doesn’t make sense. Blizzard as a company is profitable *right now* and they only report about 12% of their revenue from the entire Asian Pacific region. Losing the Chinese market wouldn’t cripple them so far as to be unrecoverable on its own.
---
Looking at you Frodan. Jk. You do you man.
---
Did he forget the smiley face to imply smugness?
---
Dam seems strong. Cool to see that they put in a few different ways for a speed run. Going to try for sub 20 when I get home.
---
Praying that it is. 😅
---
There are a few cases of rabid spending ok loot boxes so I dont mnow. Haha
---
Text posts don't generate karma. Who looks at posts like these and thinks to themselves, "Hmmm, I bet these people are only pretending to dislike Blizzard supporting a heavy-handed dictatorship!"?
---
I misunderstood. I assumed you meant username, but evidently you did not. Apologies.
---
You just think you're cool because you're ignorant as fuck. Fuck outta here.
---
If HK has been squashed, people should start changing the battle tag to FreetheUyghur or StopStealingOrgans.
---
That’s just so wrong. Can you give me one iota if évidence to support your made-up narrative?
---
Please stop making shit up to make whatever bullshit point you’re trying to push.
---
Tbh ive seen a boatload of posts with people who've spent $500+ just on HS quitting.
---
I mean, you could always plan for that type of event if you really wanted to. \**oh no IndieDiscovery, we don't want to invest the resources to make our site highly available in another region as part of a pilot light scenario that would save on costs. Look at me la te fucking da*\*
---
You probably typed this post out on a device that was made with sweatshop labor. You probably own shoes and clothes that are the same. etc.
---
You're pretty much always going to be supporting some companies that ignore or actively participate in human rights abuses for profit. More power to the people who drop Hearthstone because of this, but I'm not gonna hold it against anyone who keeps playing either.
---
On a post game interview, Blitzchung expressed his political view on Hong Kong ("Free Hong Kong"). Afterwards some time later, Blizzard took action and suspended him for 1 year, removed him from grandmasters, and took all of his prize money away. 
---
Shortly after, China Hearthstone tweeted about it being disappointed in how everything was handled and expressed they would be protecting the pride of their country.
---
Hearthstone is claiming Blitzchung went against one of their rules about offending a large group of people. 
---
It's a very bad situation for Blizzard as they keep digging themselves into a bigger hole as they appear to be puppets to the Chinese government in how they swiftly took away everything from him and fired both casters. Along with saying they will protect national pride, rather than hammer down on the rule broken.
---
Uninstalling it means nothing as well. It's what like a 15 minute download to reinstall?
---
+100 has been deposited to your Social Credit Score account
---
Cast mind vision beforhand.
---
This post is the usual argument given by Blizzard apologists, yes.
---
for the record, I don't think someone with a Maga hat saying he supports Trump would get more than a vocal warning, either. At most, a few weeks suspension.
---
Yeah real choice they were "forced" into here. China didn't even say anything and they couldn't stop themselves from fellating poo bear.  Either way they have showed their true allegiance. I do not tolerate such repugnant values and I have quit all their games. I do this not to virtue signal, but for my own conscience to rest easy
---
This is likely their security team seeing the behavior as at malicious attack.  Give it a few days.
---
Which isn't a photo ID, so 'but muh voter fraud' can still apply.
---
Still playing hearthstone trying out renounce darkness warlock and getting 12 win runs in dual class arena
---
Hahaha this one really got me. Perfect.
---
Can confirm, am Hungarian, we have some fucked up people and mindsets here, I wouldn't even know where to begin. 
---
Of course those who vote for authoritarianism are being so heavily mislead you wouldn't even believe it.
---
In a world of only black and white, you are right. But what corporates should be doing in this case is simply getting out of the line of fire so that the attention is focused somewhere else. Disney and NBA both sidestepped the issue, Blizzard should have as well. There is no winning solution for them here in choosing a side.
---
Teppen
---
That is a great insight on why companies seem so eager to please China.
---
&gt;hey should have simply put up a splash message on account deletion requests blanket stating that "due to the number of requests your process may take longer than expected.
---
They literally made a twitter post about it saying that exact thing.
---
what would you say i should craft instead of phaoris?
---
How's that calculated cause I've already failed 2 runs, do those count towards the time limit or is the limit towards the one victorious run
---
They do seem to love their chinese audience more
---
I want to delete my account, is there a customer support on blizz that I can talk to?
---
China and Chinese people will get batshit crazy on them if they keep handing out minor punishments.
---
Fact: you are retarded.
---
This is a fact and the truth.
---
So you paid them ten bucks for either something they won't ever notice, or will just revert/force a new name change on?
---
i do agree that he wont be useful in hunter or paladin now that i think about it.
---
I'm F2P so it's not like they're going to miss my non payment, but I'd really like to try to make my own little protest. My dad is from Hong Kong, and I still have family there.
---
"freeHK" works though
---
&gt; I wonder if a warning and promise of severe punishment for future transgression would have worked better here
---
If they did a warning + maybe a fine for the player, and a bit of yelling at the casters behind the scenes, this method would be effective. They simply needed to do that, and a statement saying what they did and a "we'll be more aggressive if this happens again", then follow through with that promise if it happened again, then this would not be such a big thing and the community would be more on the side of "well they were warned". But nope, Blizz just threw oil onto a fire and continue to do so now hoping it'll snuff the fire out.
---
Whats the best class-combo in arena atm?
---
Where are you from? And how much do you even know about China to claim that "any Chinese person will tell you that cheating to gain an advantage is not considered a bad thing in their culture"?? I'm a Chinese myself, and I'm pretty sure most people I personally know think cheating is shameful. I know people who cheat too, but normally they're looked down upon because of that. If a Chinese told you cheating is not a bad thing, that's just because they're trying to find an excuse for their own shameful behaviour I guess.
---
They explicitly contradict what you're claiming in their 2018 annual report:
---
"We had two customers—Sony and NetEase, Inc.—who accounted for 15% and 12%, respectively, of consolidated
---
gross receivables at December 31, 2018."
---
This is very much in line with the numbers listed above, and disproves your idea that they are able to evade well established SEC regulations and just not report revenues because they don't feel like it.
---
Thats your decision.... but like I said.. you deserve the bleak future that inaction leads to.
---
Please observe how Disney and the NBA managed to sidestep the same issues while maintaining relationships on both sides. While it would still be a lose-lose, it won't be this nuclear war that was declared on them. 
---
Going forward, I foresee a 30 second to 1 minute delay for livestreams.
---
The folly of Reddit. Read the title and explore no other information avenues. Fucking trash website.
---
Cantonese is the official language of Hong Kong, alongside with English though.

Imagine the cringe when your mates ask you: "Why did you stop playing?" and you answer "Political reasons"

I’m not a HS player, but I do play OW and I feel the same way. I logged in yesterday and felt disgusted with myself. Taking a break to see how things turn out, but it’s not looking good.
---
Purple gang
---
I had a free change. I haven't touched my blizzard account in years.
---
They haven’t disabled IOS App Store yet so if you want to put a review in do it now before that’s closed too. Just did mine
---
Apparently they put a helmet over his head in the posters and instead of having the black cast in the poster just had the lead (cover up by his [suit](http://movie.mtime.com/218085/posters_and_images/7433909/)).
---
Blitschung really should leave the country, it is known that people who oppose China 'disappear'..
---
You're probably right...
---
r/foundthehypocrite
---
Pffft, next thing you're going to tell me is that the Internet isn't just a series of tubes.
---
And? That doesn't make this right. China is scarier so let's bully the west instead? I should just accept them disrepecting me like that to protect their bottom line?
---
Ya for somereason freehongkong didint work but frehongkong did
---
The stock price will likely recover fairly quickly. There’s a lot more to Activision/Blizzard than just Hearthstone.
---
Gave shadowverse another shot, it seems to be ok. I tried to get in and quickly got out about an year ago due to how every other card seemed to generate up to 3 different other cards that each generated 3 different other cards, but this seems to be a bit subdued in the newer rotation.
---
At this point I would find it hard to believe that Blitzchung would ever play hearthstone again
---
I'll keep that in mind. Thank you.
---
They are fucked either way, but I agree. It's telling that the rest of the industry performed well and yet the didn't especially considering the CoD mobile release.
---
This game was viewed by China's mainland as well right?
---
Don’t forget that Reddit’s largest investor is also Tencent.
---
The people here make up like 1% of the player base plus most are trolls and bandwagon karma farmers who arent really doing anything. There are people who quit but most werent playing much to begin with
---
What kind of comment is that even? What was stolen here? We are talking about a contract breaking political comment that was punish, so please enlighten me on how that relates to getting a bike stolen or stop trying to relate things and just provide the fact, I will happily admit to and wrong doings of you can just provide the facts showing they happened, you being butthurt about a political situation is not a fact showing blizzard did something wrong, neither is the fact that you stole a bike.
---
bobby swimming in china money cant hear you
---
Blizzard should hire you, you clearly know more about them than geopolitical markets and their own internal revenue streams
---
BLIZZARD IS DUMB
---
Blizzard was also the first to make the mistake, so all the game companies can say "oh shit, change course don't support China after all."
---
Fair! That's my bad for assuming.
---
When are they gonna make the good games again?
---
the hell are you talking about?
---
I added a bit on the end and posted it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfslcq/the_past_few_days_feel_like_an_epic_tragedy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) I mean, I feel that sadness. Not to be overly political, but I grew up in a home that was extremely conservative, and lessons about honour and integrity and humility and all these important “Christian” traditions like helping the poor and defending the weak and being always thankful for whatever I have. Etc etc. 
---
I left home, I fell away from the evangelical community for several years, and when I came back to my church for the first time a few summers ago, the leaders I’d grown up with and still deeply respected and admired were passionately defending the Charlottesville protesters.
---
It rips your gut out. It’s a deep sort of sadness that makes you feel like you’ve gone crazy. Hell, maybe I’m wrong about everything; it’s always possible. But the pain still holds those questions... was this always hiding behind those lessons, or did I misunderstand everything growing up? Or worse, if these teachers were once good people, how can I ever be sure that I’m not enduring a similar fate? Was any of it ever real to begin with?
---
I see that questioning happening on these forums these past few days. I see the deep existential sadness that just fills the pit of your stomach, like a sense of revulsion. And I feel for all of you.
---
This isn’t a political issue, this is a civil rights and humanitarian issue. By siding with China on this issue, Blizzard is tacitly OK with organ harvesting. 
---
Bobby Kotick could eat a baby live on stage next Blizzcon and it’d still be less evil than the stance Blizzard implicitly took yesterday.
---
I had assumed that all the talk of "dusting your account" also involved using the dust to craft legendaries, dusting those, and repeating until you have nothing left.
---
www.hsreplay.net to find the missing cards. then maybe sort by usability or popularity of the card. Popular cards (like Luna) tend to anchor more decks / archetypes. Focus on deck engines or all-round popular legendaries first instead of niche win-conditions.
---
I think the level cap is 120 and you have a level 80. Also you can restore your character nowadays.
---
Yeah we boycott, this will only affect the artists as far as their time at Blizzard. It won't hurt their future job prospects, as this incident was not related to their job description.
---
I don’t think the artists, designers and programmers are involved in anything to do with company finances
---
I don't understand why you commented this. Either you're saying my opinion doesn't count because I don't play hearthstone, or not a lot of people will see this.
---
Would you prefer they camel toe them?
---
Eternal card game is fantastic and in a great place right now. Highly recommend.
---
I mean, that’s fine. I’m not after karma. If someone feels better having read it, my time is worth that.
---
Nah.
---
I put up my evidence and you reject it, well then I reject your evidence as well. Hypocrisy at its finest. 
---
And cute how u assume I haven’t been to either places. Let me get this straight to your face I’ll been to HK before, multiple times, and not only HK, but multiple cities in the rest of fking China as well. Would you like to claim that you have been to other places in China as well? I thought so. So sit down and jump off your moral hightower if you think that you can persuade people by presenting your one-sided evidence. It ain’t gonna work.
---
And nice try, but only an idiot will reveal their identity to strangers on the internet willingly. But since u claim to have read through my comments, it should be clear which country I’m from unless you have selective bias or some sort.
---
And yes you need to be educated, because of your flawed logic and misled facts. Do you even take any pride in your own words? Or are u just grossly delusional?
---
I don’t play hearthstone just subscribed to this subreddit. I might get hated for this but if this is happening to a game I play and have hundreds of hours of progression in the game. I probably won’t delete my account. I’m all for free Hong Kong but if I’m losing everything I invested into a game, I feel like I just wasted a massive amount of my time. I would eventually move on from the game of a unethical company but I would never delete my progress
---
Idk starting a trade war with the only other country able to compete economically and militarily with the US isn’t a fantastic stance
---
oh ok thanks i genuienly appriciate your input, ill try to go for even more must haves before going for those niche ones
---
Yeah it actually ruined the brawl for me
---
Blizzard clearly took a political stance by unusually harsh punishment.
---
&gt; Just show him in his suit?

I’m considering MTGA, but I also really enjoy any Turn-Based Strategy game, so I’m probably going to be playing Civilization VI
---
Not going to happen. It's Blizzards style. They'll bunker down, go full damage control, and go silent on the matter and pray the community forgets all about it in a few days/weeks. They did this for Diablo Immortal and any previous fuck ups.
---
All your comments are butthurt what the fuck are you even talking about
---
No problem, the site I linked is great for whenever you are lost on whether to craft a card or not.
---
I mean, I could easily have done that. But I just destroyed all my cards and uninstalled the game.
---
1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th amendment more likely.
---
What is this, someone posting something actually meaningful and helpful here?  That can't be right! 
---
Seriously though, do this.
---
After reading this thread, i did that too.
---
Yeah that's from Friedman doctrine gone wrong, not a legal imperative but a supposed econ obligation. Besides it could argued that taking a stand on China is in the best interest of the shareholders because then it's about short vs long gains.

For the record, what happened in NBA again?

I saw what a few people who may or may not have been antifa did, yeah. They certainly don't list attacking journalists as one of their listed goals or methods so it'd seem to be more of a slight on those individuals than antifa itself.

It sounds like your second paragraph is against the Hong Kong police and Chinese military
---
I can support Hong Kong in other ways, I'll probably continue to enjoy my video games.
---
this is reddit no
---
My main point was that they disabled reviewing hearth stone on googleplay I havnt seen anyone else mention this.
---
why have they not also deleted the other posts with similar content?
---
Could it be that my post was on the top of rising?
---
They ran themselves into a corner, and I love watching them - presumably - squirm. This could've died down in a day or two if they handled it properly - now they no longer have good options. Many players will not stand for anything less than fully backpedaling from these decisions, if that, and any concession will be a move 'against' China.
---
They fucked themselves. Which is excellent.
---
I agree. The mods are awesome.
---
Well... there was a mini controversy with the world championships the past few days where people thought Riot was censoring the Hong Kong teams, and the mods let there be multiple threads up about it, even until Riot made a statement about the controversy. I wouldn't call the League mods totalitarian just yet.
---
Found the member of Chinese government
---
Eternal Card Game is great
---
I must have gotten lucky... I submitted a photo of my ID and had a bunch of information on it censored because i didn’t want them to know and they still approved my request to delete my account
---
Every bit helps. Hopefully this incident will lead to people who would have otherwise remained disengaged to act in support of the HK protesters.
---
He CAN throw them out. It would be just extremely inconvenient.
---
Money is the only language they understand. 
---
Don't feel bad for keeping on playing, but think twice before purchasing anything from the store would be my suggestion.
---
If you can quit your job and make it out alright, you have more financial freedom than half of America. About a third of them don’t even have any savings.
---
You’re doing it in a manner that’s way over the top for r/hearthstone. We get the situation is messed up and many (myself included) are boycotting to show our support. But remember this still a subreddit about an online card game. Your post has the potential to be next to “Look at this crazy combo I pulled off in the new arena mode”. Chill dude.
---
Do they work with Whizbang? If not, well, Whizbang will go to wild soon.
---
It was actually 70 degrees today which is bizarre but I've seen snow in July too.
---
They can’t prevent your ability to make the request. 
---
As long as they have a physical or email adress you can write to you are able to make the request and they have to answer within a month.
---
Yikes, my fault. I didn't mean to imply that you were defending Blizzard's actions in any way. I just got completely fed up with the entire thing being peddled as Blizzard working hard to be neutral and went off and now I'm very sorry I did. Do people really think that Blizzard would issue a year long ban, strip winnings, and fire casters if, say, one of the tourney competitors displayed a homemade #MeToo sign during the interview and then spoke a couple of sentences in support of the movement? I don't think so. Political neutrality, my pale ass. I do hope it comes back to bite them.
---
Oh you’re right. As a teenager living in America, I’m going to fly to Hong Kong and join the protests myself. It’s about solidarity and having a collective voice standing up for what’s right. Or I guess I could be a snide, cynical piece of shit. That’s the alternative, as you’ve so eloquently demonstrated.
---
How does a picture of someone's photo ID verify them if the company does not have that ID on file to verify it?
---
They still have to fight that battle in court. Including the legal fees.
---
Actibli$$ could come out tommorow and say 'F all ya'll westerners- we are going China exclusive!' and their stock would shoot through the roof due to all the cash they make off any lootbox filled gambling sims the Chinese eat up. 
---
You can pretend all you want a few angry neckbeards on reddit make any difference, I enjoy the chaos too, but in the end the market in China is MASSIVE- billions of ready consumers all waiting for next product.
---
To expand on the "technical issue" bit, here's my explanation for the likely chain of events.
---
Reposting an earlier comment of mine : 
---
This isn't a conspiracy, it's simple logistics.
---
If I were a web server engineer, why the hell would I put a bunch of processing power towards an infrequently used system like this? When most people log on, they're doing some billing changes or buying something. Not cancelling their account. Therefore, I put most power into billing and purchases, and only a little into account cancellations. Doing otherwise would be horrendously inefficient. Like, buying a cruise ship to sail ten people at a time, inefficient.
---
Right, I'm gonna extend my thought, since I've been seeing people state that ID's are required for this process of account deletion, as well as that automated systems for account deletion aren't allowed.
---
That means that everything has to be done in person, by hand. With the requirement of IDs in order to delete or change ownership of an account (so that John Q Public can't just jack your password and delete your account), there's probably a single person or group of people doing data entry and handling these deletion/cancellation requests manually.
---
Most likely, they came in for a normal day of work, and suddenly noticed that they have 20,000 more emails than they did overnight, all requesting account deletion, and more pouring in by the second. 
---
In order to delete the accounts, these days entry folks have to manually check the validity of the IDs of the person making the request, compare it with financial info Blizz has to make sure the guy making the request is who they claim to be, and then delete the account, and message IT to clear the data of EU citizens from their backups. 
---
That. Takes. *Time*. This whole process does, and when that team saw that giant flood of 20,000 emails, with more constantly pouring in, they thought "Oh fuck, this is*WAY* too much work to handle!" And so told their manager that they needed to stem the flow so that they could play catch up.
---
That's one way to dox yourself.
---
If you want to do a different build, you can just do a single round of Hagatha and Duplatransmogrify any other minion to get rid of your BFFs. It's really quite simple ...
---
Once again big companies showing they are not on the consumer side. Blizzard really wants to keep those dollars from the China market and screw everyone that talks bad about them.
---
Go fuck yourself Blizzard
---
Mad respect.  You backed up your words and did something many others aren't willing to do.
---
&gt; falsely believe
---
correctly*
---
If it helps, I’ll have you know that I’ve just returned not long ago from a two-year study trip in Canada and I miss it a lot and can’t wait to find an opportunity in the future to actually leave China for good. I am fully aware of what other countries are like, and how hard my own country is lacking in a lot of aspects. I’m simply trying to provide people with a different point of view on this matter, I apologize if it sounded like I’m being brainwashed by my country.
---
Also, I’m not blaming this whole thing on the protestors, I really do hope that their protests can have the result that they ask for, that would definitely be the best case scenario. I was simply saying that some of their protests have indeed gotten a little too violent and caused disorder among the everyday people of Hong Kong and I think that’s the main reason as to why the government is treating this matter so seriously this time.
---
But thanks for sharing your opinions.
---
&gt; Man, Blizzard has royally fucked themselves on this one. Stepped right in it, they have.
---
Only if the community follow through. Too often internet outrage dies off after a week or two. This is what they are currently banking on.
---
any high level accounts? I'll take it for you if you don't want it
---
Your thread offers no chance of discussion. It only calls for a circlejerk. Post that shit elsewhere.
---
Just sue them. I hope this trash company dies asap.
---
bIg OoOoOf
---
No one should tell you to feel bad. It's a personal decision because people should have the right to choose what they say, think, and do.
---
Appeasement. I call it pandaring.
---
OK, then eagerly I await Blizzard's condemnation of the message considering they are an American company with an American audience.
---
"Even" nothing. You act like it's a surprise that conservatives don't like Communist China. Your biases are insane.
---
Well duh sugar daddy China told them to block it lol
---
That is far from the only way to get rid of it. The fastest way takes about 10 seconds from a fresh run and it clears your BFF's in one shot ...

I hope you never have any challenge to your privileged life, my friend.
---
I agree. Dust your collection if you're 100% willing to walk away. Otherwise, you're just virtue-signaling and riding the bandwagon.
---
you are very welcome, thank you for your support!
---
My (poor) literal translation: "Federal data protection commissioner"
---
No worse than your average American government organization's name. The Germans just like to be efficient with their use of spaces.
---
I think the semantics are important. "Buygreenland" is more of an opinion/demand, so it can not be false. But if you say "Greenlandisfree", then that is false, because it is not free, and can thus not be allowed as battletag.
---
Other examples of disallowed tags are "HongKongischeap", "Trumpisnotanidiot" and "youcanfreelydeleteyouraccounts". But examples of allowed tags are "HongKongisdoomed", "poohbearisnotalookalike" and "Hongkongistooexpensive" (the last one is unclear, but I would assume if it was not too expensive China would have bought it already).
---
Well your username seems accurate at least.  
---
You do know that China is not even 12 percent of their world revenue?  
---
Cut off 88 percent of your body and see how the 12 percent survives. Good luck with that.
---
Oh shot Blizzcon is in 23 days?! Yess I love this time of year. Hopefully we get some cool info about the next expansion.
---
Let’s cut this out now. Nobody is obligated to take a stand. If Kripp and Thijs aren’t well versed in world politics, they don’t have to speak. If they have a personal opinion but don’t want to share it, they don’t have to speak. In Kibler’s post he mentioned this. He thinks it’s wrong and thinks it’s worth quitting but nobody is required to feel the same way.
---
you just seemed to reply rather aggressively so I was wondering if something I said set you off, I'm sorry if I offended you &lt;3
---
A GM for the Houston Rockets, not a player.
---
&gt; I didn't say I was brave you silly Billy
---
Oh, I am sorry for the confusion. I was being sarcastic. What I meant was that Kibler was being brave and you were not.
---
Totally my mistake, I left out the /s
---
Dude come on. I’m boycotting too. But let those that want to continue to play enjoy themselves. You just sound spiteful.
---
Which one of those primates you identify yourself as?
---
Ruthlessly efficient.
---
Then don’t be an idiot.
---
If you want to participate in the Chinese market, your company needs to be owned in part by a Chinese company. You can think of Tencent as an access point for gaming companies.
---
Hahahaha NoT mUH GaMeS nice way to only care once it affects you
---
I'm from Hong Kong. Please explain to me how boycotting Blizzard will solve the turmoil here.
---
Is that a JoJo reference?
---
a free china market is a better negotiating partner than an authoritarian regime economy that is in lockstep with the government's whims
---
but that interacts with deathless and restores it to full health and all that, this works in a different way I would assume.
---
As do I, however I am doubtful. It is a limited event with relatively expensive tickets and the people that tend to go to a companies own event like this tend to be the more hardcore fans. Hopefully I am wrong but I would suspect the fans going will not kick up a storm
---
Have you noticed how the root comment this was for was removed? What did it say? I'm assuming from yours and other comments it was about some kind of idea for something at blizzcon, but it looks like somebody didn't fancy that idea.
---
Thanks, needed that extra push to uninstall battle.net.
---
NBA is an American league though... Sure, I get they might have been Chinese soil at that time but still.
---
Got to build up all that hype before BlizzCon, duh!
---
So the fact that blizzard is keeping true to a contract makes them pro China?  Just because a comment was made about Hong kong riots and it was removed they are pro China? As I have said before I Will believe you of you can prove that blizzard did not just act as they always do when someone breaks a contract.
---
In fact what you are saying is that if blizzard should not remove any form of comments you are basically saying that it should be okay to be pro holocaust or pro slavery on a blizzard channel, you cannot allow political points just because you think they are right, if you want to be a political which is the point of the blizzard contract in question you remove alle political comments, denying one comment does not automatically make you pro something else. If he had spoken against the Hong Kong riots dhouæd he then also have been allowed to?
---
You are mixing political points with a game company that is trying to avoid being political, if you cannot see the difference between not wanting political comments and being pro China then there is no point in continuing since you will be impossible to argue with, the sad thruth is that so many people just decide what they think happened instead of looking at the facts.
---
So try actually proving that blizzard activly is supporting China against the Hong kong riots or get off your high horse and understand that just because you think something that does not make it true.
---
As a fellow Russian dude, I can see where you coming from. Living in a country with a cruel government can easily change your point of view on lots of things. They do everything for you to think that not everything is shit about this regime. And it is complete bullshit. "But wait, we got X and Y!" No, what you got from them is ignorance and brainwash.
---
But, the point is. There is nothing wrong to feel heartbroken when some simple guys end up in jail for 5+ years just because they like bitching about our leaders on social media. Nothing wrong to feel heartbroken when your government tries to cut off your country from the rest of the world starting from internet. When the TV shows only how good our glorious leaders are, and how bad are the other countries. When your country sends military basically against your brothers. When the police force beat up unarmed protesters to the point they can't even move. And so on.
---
Our countries are destined to fall apart, but there's nothing wrong with it. I know this is hard, but nobody deserves this shit.
---
There is a mod response in another thread about deleting reposts.
---
I assume that's why your post got deleted.
---
It's not a big conspiracy.
---
Antifa isn't an organized group (except for a separate group that goes by the same name in Germany). It literally just means "anti-fascist."
---
Ngo got attacked at a protest. Unless you're going to say the El Paso shooter invalidates the entire right-wing, you can't really dismiss antifa over Ngo's attack.
---
Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I am really glad that you see to have the ability to think independently and can see things from a relatively balanced perspective. I think this is commendable considering the amount of propaganda and filtering of information that is happening in China.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for a lot of other people that I have met.  Remember that not everything the government is doing is in your best interest, sometimes the interests align and you and the government are both happy, but other times they will not. Always question and make your own decisions on to believe in. Good luck!
---
Very true
---
Thanks for your insight
---
Does it work on Whizbang?
---
How dare you! That's so offensive!
---
Wait, Blizzard just banned him? They should’ve straight up executed him, or at least sent him in a gulag, if they truly wanted to appease the communist government. Pathetic attempt to cater to oppressive regimes. Chung got off lightly.
---
It's a good thing, don't worry bout it.
---
Literally the reason the card was made and then they rotated her out the next expansion lol. Cool to see it back again.
---
Is this some programming joke im too stupid to understand
---

He can't speak out before Ocelote approves of it.

Ocelote has his problems up and above because his team is currently an important part of the biggest league event of the year, you know, the biggest pc game which happens to be owned by china.

If thjis talks, he fucks the entire org.

He's got a bit of a point. If 10,000 people tried to change their name to that, what would happen? Battletags only have four digits, so theoretically the max is 9,999 copies of the same name so as to differentiate the users. Still, I highly doubt 10,000 people changed their names to FreeHongKong, much less everything to do with Hong Kong.
---
Let's not jump onto Mark Kents dick. He's populist at best and awful person. His treatment of Firefall and position on gamergate says it all.

While he isn't wrong in this particular case, the only reason why he is saying it is for attention on internet. He is literally full of shit.

You're ignoring that the rule didn't explicitly state political opinion, but "anything that damages Blizzard image". Turns out Blizzard deems the fight against a fascist government that literally harvests organs from dissidents "damaging to their image".

Yea, this is fraud. Chargebacks are meant for legitimate disputes (like not receiving goods that you paid for), not to try to get a refund months later because you don't like the company you bought from any more.

You don't have to believe me, it really doesn't matter.  One way or another in six months time we will look back and one of us will be right and one of us would be wrong.  I have nothing to gain by convincing you of anything now.
---
But if you're someone who doesn't believe in coincidences, let me ask you this.  If a huge number of people had quit Hearthstone don't you think there would be *some* evidence of it by now?  And that evidence would be plastered all over this sub with the usual associated high fives and "we did it reddit" posts?
---
You don't need to reply, as I said I don't care if you believe me or not, just think about it.
---
What the fundesdatenschutzbeauftragte?
---
That's true, they should have been aware that given the current status someone could have likely showed its support to HK.
---
I'm not sure others would have handled it so much better, but yeah big mess up after the facts already happened.
---
Yep they know we already spent money on their games so they can tell us to fuck off.
---
Oh piss off they are taking a stand for something right and don't need your shit to out them down. Take the downvote and the many that come

How is it any different than the word 'schadenfreude'?
---
Did you contact support through email or phone? On what grounds did they deny you?
---
暴雪中国 means Blizzard China.
---
that way it cant blow over and we start playing their games again
---
When those computer systems fail are they usually from companies whose soul business revolves around server uptime?  You never hear about Amazon having difficulties or steam during their sales.  You never hear about blizzard have problems with transactions when a new WoW expansion is released.  Hell they don't even have problems when they push updates.  Who has ever got an error when their overwatch needs to update or hearthstone? But a few kilobytes of data for an account delete request bogs them down?  Come on now.
---
Literally nobody thinks he was banned just for breaking some obscure minor rule; We ALL know he was banned because what he said could offend China. But did you ever think about why that rule exists? Blizzard can not let an official Blizzard stream culminate in someone denouncing China. The Chinese government are touchy enough about these kinds of things that they could, overnight, remove Blizzards right to sell game there which would be devastating.
---
Blizzard is NOT making a political statement here - divisive politics is not a good area for a company trying to sell it products to as many people as possible. They are just saying that nobody else is allowed to make political statements on their platform either.

I won't deny that the game has been feature poor. Thats why I was excited for tombs of terror, it seemed like the team was trying out something new in order to shake things up, which might have helped set a precedent for cool things in the future. 
---
I think that it's important to remember that many of these people are doing jobs for money, just like everyone else. I've seen so many people hating on everyone working at Blizzard, even those who have nothing to do with this whole debacle. It's felt like yelling at a grocery store clerk for the shitty price of something. 
---
Additionally, this game has been something I have played for a long time, and because I was deleting I wanted to say my thanks to the development team
---
But do you think they're going to have enough security officers on hand to deal with waves of protesters? Unless they resort to using excessive force, which unless the protest turns violent, would be breaking a ton of laws, i don't see them being effective in the slightest

I understand, since it's a pretty common sentiment, but ultimately, social media is people.  Whether or not an intentional effort is put into it, ultimately it is the will of a bunch of disparate individuals as to what becomes a real campaign.  Definitely, 'spreading awareness' often skips a step straight to 'spreading the idea of a boycott' because, to the people involved, it feels like the natural and instant reaction to that knowledge.  This is part of the barrier that makes it harder to inform people who are initially opposed, because from their perspective, they've received an 'intent' before a 'cause.'  And there's no real way to corral this behavior because it isn't controlled by any given person.  (And of course, it's true that people will get caught up in something that they agree with in concept but haven't critically engaged with)
---
But the way I see it, the cultivated cultural aversion to call-out culture over the last few years is dangerous because it can extremely easily be used as a way to make anyone think 'Oh, it's those crazy, overreacting, emotional *kids* again' without triggering peoples' critical thinking.  We need to be aware that misinformation spreads much faster than correction, but I think that, rather than being aware, the current lens people are using is dismissive.  
---
If you ask me, this is an intentional,  or at least subconsciously discriminatory, frame-of-view that is being subtly pushed (in conjunction with 'fake news').  But, regardless, I've definitely seen a lot of good examples of important information being disseminated, and people having no willingness to even engage with it, with call-out culture as their core excuse.  Of course there will always be people who are ignorant, but I think that it is worthwhile to work against giving more people an excuse to be.
---
In the end, I guess the problem is that a group's collective appearance will never be as refined as a person's cultivated opinion, and that's never going to be easy to reconcile.  What's important, I think, is to try to get to the heart of a matter.  Not necessarily the factual core (which is important, but not always immediately accessible), but the emotive heart.  Because people with good, altruistic intentions always have the potential to correct their mistakes, if it turns out that they made one.  They might not have the individual maturity to do so in immediate grace, but that's how I see things.  
---
Every big group ultimately boils down to people, people who know that they alone cannot achieve the best for everyone they care about.  It's not perfect, but there's definitely clear reasons why things gain momentum, why spreading information can become a large scale movement that is a reaction to that information.

Do you have any idea of what a government controlling the media is? Every company is told what to say and not to say, be it international or not. We have no idea what could happen to NetEase or their offices should they decide not to comply, but I'm sure we can all guess, given all the rumors of organ harvesting and the likes. NetEase being sued would accomplish nothing
---
There's a discussion for 偷米's statement on the front page.
---
Ultimately this is a rather complex issues. On one hand I agree that the action people are taking against Blizzard is doing a lot of good. It's spreading a ton of awareness to a market that isn't known for political activism (apart from Gamer rights /s) and providing a clear warning to companies who may have done the same thing in the future.
---
On the other hand I feel incredibly sorry for Blizzard as this literally could have been any company. Now they're being placed in a position where the only thing they can do to win back public favor is to become the first major company with significant roots in China to make comments that will effectively be supporting the people of Hong Kong. It's an absolutely unrealistic task being placed upon them and ultimately it's a task that would only be meaningful if other companies followed suit. That's ultimately what I'm referring to when I say that larger companies need to be taking action. I also disagree that there's nothing more productive that we could be doing. If people were focusing this effort on writing to politicians or larger companies, then that would ultimately help the people of Hong Kong out a lot more.
---
 While I think a lot of good is coming from this, at the same time there's a lot of people pushing an incredibly negative mindset. When you have somebody like Zalae complaining on twitter that people keep asking him to quit his job, you know something is wrong. There's nothing ethically wrong with continuing to support Blizzard given the hypocrisy of singling out one company, and the people who disagree are just creating contempt towards this movement.
---
It's kind of crazy considering how their country would just be willing to murder them in the blink of an eye with no hesitation.
---
Yanjia this is incredibly misleading:
---
Blizzard (western markets): no politics
---
Netease (blizzard china): we are disgusted by the players actions and protect the dignity of China
---
Not only does the Chinese version contradict the entire point of Blitz being banned, blizzard hq has been silent on the issue leaving only the Chinese account to represent why the company choose such punative measures. At no point was thus rhetoric negated by blizzard HQ implying they stand by it.
---
Same. Been in it for a minute so I understand.
---
So long and thanks for all the fish.
---
But honestly I have my doubts about new shit. Games been out for a while and theres not shit for new game modes.
---
I haven't seen any of the animosity of which you speak either. Just people sticking up for the employees against little oppression if any.
---
I'm only speculating, but it's probably being manipulated in a similar way to how Steam doesn't count reviews they consider unrelated to the game itself when they get review bombed for other reasons such as developers being shitty in general.
---
Calling redditors stupid?
---
Has nobody ever taught you that when you point your finger at people, you're pointing 3 right back at yourself?
---
Thank you mind redditor
---
Yeah, if things burn out and people just go back to buying Blizzard, it will be nothing more than a normal bump in the road. If you look at it on the one year scale, even the little drop at the end is a significantly higher profit margin than a while ago. If people want to make themselves heard at Blizzard, that profit line has to drop a long way and be consistently downward.
---
I like your version better too
---
First of all this is absolute semantics, but of course let's break that down real quick. Hong kong under official titles is seperate from china but very much classed as a PART of china It is a province of China out of the 34,  
---
there are two  Special administrative regions; Hong Kong and  Macau. You should probably do your research first. And also the voice actor of mei has also inputted information on it that also directly relates to chinese as in several of her tweets you see her speaking about mandarin.
---
In Germany it is illegal to send a copy of your id over the internet...
---
Which one yours or my example? If you are talking about yours then grammatically nothing the only difference is that people use the term Schadenfreude.  
---
Germany simply has the grammatical concept of compound words. Smash two existing nouns together and you got a new compound word. In theory the German language would therefore have an infinite amount of legit grammatically correct words. If anyone uses them is a completely different question.
---
Such a broken card. I got a &lt;10 min run starting with 20 BFFs. The only "hard" part is getting lucky and dodging the naturalize on boss 6.

I demand to see a live feed of the president of blizzard being burned at the stake (or them releasing a GIANT middle finger to china, like a HK Mei skin for Overwatch) before going back to the company

Talon Esports of Pacific region, there are the players and names who we are familiar with.

我剛剛其實最擔心的是我會不會被BAN掉，我剛剛最擔心的是下一周我能不能撥overwatch的比賽
---
In fact what I most worry about is whether I would be banned, whether I could cast the Overwatch tournament next week or not.
---
我覺得這是一個...
---
I think it is...
---
當初overwatch已經沒有甚麼機會
---
At that time, Overwatch was almost dead(Translator's note: in Taiwan I guess). 
---
大家都在說太平洋區很爛，都說太平洋區是最差的賽區
---
Everyone said Pacific region sucked, complained Pacific region was the weakest region. 
---
我心裡一直在想說，沒有對決過怎麼會知道
---
I always think how did they know the outcome before any match taken yet.
---
所以Talon能代表太平洋區，去打這個比賽的時候
---
So, (when I know)Talon Esports could be the represent team of Pacific region, go to participate the tournament.

I think his/her point was that the CCP can easily forbid mcdonalds/etc from selling in China, if they don't play ball.
---
Maybe what s/he should've said was "People won't be able to buy what the government forbids them to buy."
---
It's escalating fast 
---
Blizzard is likely this is to protect against hacked accounts and the hackers deleting the account after trading away WoW items or whatnot. 
---
I disagree with the approach of Blizzard towards the politics in HK and don't understand why they took a stand ffs
---
No alternative, but I'm not really into gaming. I don't miss Hearthstone tbh, because in the end I only played like 1 or 2 times the week. But I still loved to watch content creators like Roffle, Dane, Rdu, Thijs while I was crocheting. I think, I will watch them in future too, because I don't see the reason to punish them as well.
---
My friend plays World of Kings and he loves it. Don't know much about the company behind the game, but the game itself seems to be highly addictive.
---
Still a minority share at this stage. They needed the money to break out of the Actiblizz contract I believe. Bungie aren't a great company, and if they slip into the same crap Blizz are pulling I'll pull the plug on their game as well, but for now they are acceptable for my conscience.

Interesting, I got in just under the wire. About an hour before that post. Completely painless. Clicked delete, got an email shortly afterwards with a link to back out if I change my mind “in the next few days”. Heh. No.
---
There have been two ddos attacks on the overwatch servers that were resolved in a few hours in the hmm I think 4+ years I've played over watch that have affected me.  I've never had to wait or have gotten an error when the game needs to download a multi gigabyte update.  Also like I said their payment servers sure can handle a fuck load of transactions when they release a new game or expansion.
---
As I have stated several times I am fully supporting the Hong kong riots, you call something a fact, you link a proof? How can you actually argue for a proof when the first thing it states when I open it if "Misleading"?
---
You are giving blizzard guilt for something a sub contractor did in all haste, I commented on what I think is reasonable about that, you say I won't move an inch, I say you have so fare not produced anything remotely linking blizzard to pro China or anything like that yet.
---
Maybe wake up and understand that your innert hate for something, and I am not saying that hate is wrong at all, does not make a proof for something else.
---
I'll openly say I don't like China, never have never will, but that is not the same as misleading proof proving that blizzard does. 
---
And yea I have a 1 year old account with no real posting history, how does that change anything said or prove me wrong in any way? Trying to beliddle me like that does not make your misleading proof any more correct.
---
It say "anything that brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of public" yall just take the parts that suits your agenda.
---
Both me and my partner canceled our wow subscription and encourage other friends of ours to do the same... don't know how much it would affect them, but it sure as hell piss me off
---
There’s not much room for discretion here. On what planet does “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time” not count as a political statement?
---
And if someone you employed makes a statement on livestream that could potentially alienate an entire country’s worth of customers from your company without giving you any sort of warning whatsoever first - even if it is a very honorable statement - of course you’re not going to trust them well enough to represent you for future tournaments (at least not for a while). As for the casters, they both knew what he was going to say and they encouraged him anyway. I wouldn’t trust them either.
---
We literally found that Chinese spy was the personal assistant tot he current democratic leader of the House of Representatives.
---
Russia, by comparison, sent some internet trolls and third rate businessmen/women to try to trade intelligence for money.
---
Meanwhile China has basically co-opted US technology via outright theft, put in spies at all
---
Levels from industry to politics, and is actively engaging in genocide in the West. Complete with forced sterilization, concentration camps, ISIS-like destruction of cultural artifacts, forced impregnation/rape.
---
This is not a joke. This is China. I don’t think boycotts work but we should never let them dictate the terms of our speech or morality. Because this is theirs. By forcing them to hear our speech to benefit from out economic machinations, that is the only way forward.
---
Instead, inaction from governments and companies has led to the opposite situation. They get all the economic benefits and we have to self censure and give up our ideals such as human rights and dignity.
---
What a mad lad, mad respect bro
---
English inherits that trait from German.
---
12 percent is a lot, and it's not like they stand to lose their entire business elsewhere. The real value in ditching China is no longer having to put up with China's bullshit. China's essentially using their market for blackmail.
---
Blizzard bad
---
I don't want Blizzard to *truly* end, but I do want something far better to rise from the ashes of all this.
---
Renounce your greed, mend the wounds you've made, &amp; return to your former glory, Blizzard. Either rise from this disaster and do that, or do not rise back up at all.
---
So you think he should be left off scot free? I’ve read many articles that say a punishment is valid, but not as severe as this.
---
A five second google search and wikipedia article doesnt make a person informed or knowledgable about the situation.
---
Thats faux-intellectualism.
---
This is a serious problem. It warrants a serious analysis. Assuming that a “quick google search” clears up the confusion is *exactly* the problem i am talking about.
---
I remember I replied to one of your comments like yesterday.  
---
I don't understand why you are still intent on posting extremely bad takes on this situation. If you're not gonna stand with the rest of us, AT LEAST save yourself from all the downvotes.  
---
It's funny that you disregard this movement because it "does nothing" and it's futile, but you seem intent on pushing your viewpoint to this reddit, where it will do nothing, and it's futile. You are a tiny drop in this ocean and if you genuinely think that this issue isn't hurting Blizz severely right now, then you're not paying attention.  
---
Companies like Blizz are aligning themselves with China's morals for financial reasons. This IS hurting them, and this is a wider message to companies as a whole. If you sell out your freedoms for money abroad, you're gonna lose money back home, because you can't play both sides.  
---
I implore you to stop posting things like this, not just because it is in my opinion just the wrong stance to take, but because you're not adding to the conversation and farming downvotes. (I didn't add one to your post, but come on man, you're better than being against a movement that's message is to celebrate the liberties that we should all have a right to, regardless of whether or not you consider it to be impactful enough)
---
You are the content the paying users consume, beating you with legendary cards you cant afford is the reason THEY purchase cards, so yes, you still support even if you don't pay
---
To help paint a picture, the extradition bill essentially allows for HK criminals to be moved to mainland China to be trialed. Which doesn't seem like a big deal, but what happens here is that people would voice their displeasure, get arrested and sent to Mainland China, no longer protected by HK's own laws and thusly well.. probably disappear...
---
We should all change our battle tags to things like "Tiananmen Square massacre" or "Taiwan Number 1"
---
Now I wish I had a blizzard account so I could delete it
---
He knew and chose to let it happen. He decided it was the right thing. He has his principles.
---
So yes, was about to buy one, but not anymore I guess.
---
Then there is Blizzard, making left right and center hate them. It's quite amusing to be honest.
---
Lol, or system Hungarian or some shit. What's a "dont"....
---
&gt;It isn't perfect, but it is a lot better than just whining around on Blizzard subs. Plus I feel it is more constructive than just plain negative.
---
I loathe these types of malignantly defeatist attitudes. It's not enough to be defeatist, also have to try to infect others with your cynical defeatism.
---
The so-called whining on Blizzard subs has raised Western awareness and hence political pressure on the Hong Kong situation. This has been enough to get public denouncements from two US senators and coverage from main stream sources like the New York Times and the Guardian.
---
Helping the issue stay in focus here on reddit has been at least as helpful, if not much more, than doing traditionally "constructive" things like writing letters to your senator. Better yet, do both.
---
Yeah, other times the topic has come up, Chinese players have mentioned that a lot of them just mod that shit back in anyway.
---
Go to Gods Unchained. There's a future there. Blizzard isn't worth supporting right now anyway, being fired is a blessing in disguise.
---
Do you derive some sort of nasty pleasure from being this pedantic? Are you SO happy that you need to be **technically** right that you simply **cannot** keep your irrelevant comments to yourself?
---
I'm sure you know exactly what's happening and exactly why people are angry and I'm **sure** deep down you even agree, and yet you feel the need to come be the "uhm...actually" guy, you absolute cliché of a human being.
---
There was a HS tournament in China, and the winner stated how he stands with Hong Kong, and they punished him for it by taking his winnings and removing him from tournament or something, maybe a ban.  They also fired the 2 casters there for whatever reason. 
---
Blizzard stated that they didnt punish the player for his stance, but simply because they dont allow political statements on their broadcast.  But, people here are super butthurt because they still believe blizzard did it just because China gives them money or something, which is true, but at the same time he did break the rules.  
---
Now, a tweet from a Chinese company saying they stand with china is making it's way around this sub and people are saying its blizzard Chinese department but it's not.
---
Do you think that small companies like your dentist or your opticians will have an online application process to remove your data? Email or verbal request is perfectly fine
---
Poor kripp is gonna live in poverty for the rest of his life now
---
Welp I guess this is what I deserve for sharing an innocent comment.
---
More the Star Wars: The Force Harmoniously Awakened
---
Looks like I’m not playing hearthstone today then
---
It's not like we can go to hong Kong and shoot at Chinese government's men, we do what we can, for instance showing our disappointment with a western company endorsing tyranny. But sure better leave them have their way and shut down free speech, I don't know if this will change anything, but I refuse to give them more of my time and money, and others agree with me, maybe we won't make a difference but at least we have our dignity intact

This is fraud as others have said.
---
So not a good idea.
---
Literally only started playing this game 2 weeks ago and already I want nothing to do with it or Blizzard. Fucking disgusting
---
I have no expectation or wish that racial supremacists or Nazis have a place at the table of ideas and I question anyone that thinks they do. If those are the sort of people antifa is directing their ire then power to them.

Hey Fairpaws, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters.

---
Anything that hurts big companies is passed down to innocent workers. Your point has some legitimacy, but the idea that companies only have to follow the law when it doesn't reduce their profit, because profit reduction would lead to layoffs, is absurd
---
I honestly think this is the truth and that it is actually far better than saying that "Blizzard is stopping us." 
---
I would absolutely love for it to be that so many people are trying to delete *that their servers can't even handle it.* 
---
That would show how much of an impact it really has had.
---
I could be wrong and it could just be them being petty, but I prefer this head canon.
---
That law was/is pretty frickin shitty so at least some good out of it
---
Saying "Fans are boycotting Blizzard after China scandal". Will update this post with full translation later, on mobile now.
---
Because we all think Switzerland and Sweden sided with Nazi Germany in World War 2, even though they were neutral, right?
---
Hong Kong 🇭🇰!!!
---
See you back in 2 weeks.
---
I think you mean you will be banned from appearing on sponsored Blizzard broadcasts if you use that platform to make politically motivated statements.
---
I feel like that's a strawman developed to de-legitimize them and doesn't really hold water when the places they *are* showing up at far-right/supremacist events. Saying the next "dangerous opinion" could be mine is quite the slippery slope down from standing against racial supremacists, sexists and straight up fascists. People can make an intelligent decision on when a group's actions stay or stray from their goals. I fear them a lot less than groups that go around chanting blood and soil that's for sure.
---
Hadn't that company not already made similar "Diablo" games but without paying for the IP, so Blizzard was in at a crossroad, join them and let them pay for it and get part of the revenue or they would continue to use Blizzard IP but without royalties and acces to the Chinese market?
---
Now I'm not sure, I just remember reading something about that during the "don't you guys have phones?" scandal.
---
The overkill in the subtext. Beauty.
---
Right now we’ve got people on opposite sides of politics arguing against this decision because it 1) involves human rights violations and 2) is happening because of China.
---
Yeah, I actually did. And so did 17 other people, so I guess that’s a sign you have to work on your sarcasm
---
You BMd one to many times
---
True, sad empty halls and seats (except for the security) would be a statement as well.
---
China doesn't have to be as bad as to be taking organs, they only have to inconvenience me with their laws, which they have.  
---
As a non citizen of china I have no obligation to cater to their mentally ill, obsessive compulsive need to worship authority. Such an authority that can't design obedience and must enforce it with violence are not worth obeying.  
---
Human rights &gt; the law, or its "Correct" application.  
---
You're catering to the people who can't handle images of gore and bone. You're catering to those who would infantile others to make up for their inability to manage cognizant adults.  
---
Order for orders sake is mental illness. Just like someone toiling to create a spotless lawn, or a spotless paint job, it's an obsessive compulsive behavior with little real utility.
---
&gt; However, WHAT THE FUCK did the commentators do wrong?
---
They asked Chung to "say the eight words". To which Chung replied with the Hong Kong thing. 
---
There's certainly nothing wrong with Chung's message, but asking him to say it was what brought the two on China's radar in the first place, and is ultimately the reason they were sacked, I believe.
---
If Chung had just said his message and the moderators had been flabbergasted by it, I doubt this would've happened to them. 
---
*If* - and this is really an if - they asked him to "say the eight words", then they made the stream political, which is at least questionable in their professional role as casters.
---
Suck your chinese overlord dick.
---
It’s not exactly hard to figure out what the caption says just based on context clues
---
And 2 weeks later youre asking your account back. I really hope theyll ignore every single request.
---
how long till she is removed from the game.
---
Seriously. I thought for sure by now they would have released some PR piece and lessened the punishment. They must be under severe pressure to not do anything right now and try to set a precedent. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if there was a big layoff soon.
---
Nice
---
I see what you did there
---
I've actually picked empty loot box twice in my run. It's really helpful if you don't wanna fill your deck with unsynergistic cards. Beat the boss first try in under 33 mins.
---
Oh please, they'll be fine. It'll all be forgotten in a week or two. It'll start up again around Blizzcon while people farm their easy karma, then be relegated to random quip now and then people will upvote cause it'it's a reference they totally get.
---
&gt;Silence me with your downvotes daddy.
---
Okay son
---
&gt;Using the broadcast to support a highly polarizing political view was a clear violation of Blitzchung's contract, as well as the casters'
---
Except the rule was written in such a way there is no clear cut on what is safe to be said on stream: one could say they think people who eat seaweed are gross and that could get them banned as well because it's an insult to a group of people that eats it.
---
That rule basically only exist to allow Blizzard to smack down the ban hammer when someone says something they don't like
---
&gt;It's an important rule because it protects the credibility and the watchability of the sport. They were punished accordingly and (spoiler) it wasn't by the Californian side of the company; foreign esports leagues have localized offices and decisions. This was the APAC league, headquartered in China.
---
Your point? It's still fucking Blizzard and they still bend over to the Chinese goverment regardless of where the ban came from
---
&gt;All of this support of "freedom" is completely tangential and it's overwhelmingly toxic to misdirect your hatred at the American side of a video game company
---
Maybe because Blizzard is a bloody America company? And they are responsible what their subsidiaries do? Also nice of you to ommit the fact people cheered for the Blizzard employees in America and their own acts of protests, real classy 
---
&gt;If you feel strongly about the HK protests, you'd be better off taking it up with China
---
Don't worry, while this has been kickstarted by Blizzard, China ain't surely blameless and they better fucking learn people got tired of their authoritarian a long time ago, and if they try to influence companies outside his soil they better watch out because they don't have the means to silence people outside the country
---
&gt;Instead, this community seems determined to victimize Blizzard because outrage culture makes it convenient and fun to punch up at your nearest figure of semi-authority who is bound by customer service not to punch back.
---
BECAUSE. BLIZZARD. FUCKING. BANNED. THE. GUY. If it was China who stole the prize money do you think we would be angry at Blizzard? Of course not! It's them that kickstarted all this shit, regatdardless if it was American's Blizzard or China's Blizzard so noe they must suffer the consequences of it
---
if those half are streams with  &lt; 3 viewers, it won't be noticed
---
Makes me think free honour kill sadly
---
Which is exactly why it's ridiculous that so many streamers dont have the balls to speak up
---
There ain't no good way of recovering from this. 0. Nada. Nope.
---
I've been told that teachers who work in China get told that homosexuality is a "western disease" but I understand that China is massive enough to have regional differences in spite of the CCP's homogenization efforts.
---
You mean that TechInAsia story? By a publication which doesn't even acknowledge the current storm related to Apple, Blizzard, China and HK? Yeah. I wonder if that's fully reliable.
---
My battletag has 5 digits
---
TuckFrump though
---
Free honorable kill!
---
They might have a lot of money but how much of their income potential would they lose without hearthstone?
---
You have to realize it's two separate albeit related issues.
---
* Hong Kong Independence.
---
* Companies kowtowing to authoritarian pressure.
---
Deleting your account may not directly help Hong Kong's struggle, but it sends a clear message to Blizzard that you do not endorse companies that supports oppression and censorship. Other companies *will* be watching the outcome of this.
---
Besides, this is very much a why-not-both kind of situation.
---
That being said, I had no problems sending in my request (EU). Authenticated with e-mail and secret question:
---
 *Your request to remove your Blizzard account's data has been accepted and is now in processing.*
---
Well, China has 1.4 billion people and the rest of earth has 6.3 billion (both rough estimates). I have no idea how many in each group are actual potential customers of Blizzard, but assuming the percentage of potential customers in China is close to the average as found in all other countries, then yes, losing x/6.3 billion customers in order to retain x/1.4 billion is a losing proposition. However, while the Communist Party in China can effectively cut Blizzard off from their entire population in a single action, there is no reason to assume that 100% of all non-Chinese customers would participate in a boycott of Blizzard in response.
---
So for example if only one in five non-Chinese customers boycotts Blizzard, then they would lose just under 1.3 billion  non-Chinese customers in order to retain 1.4 billion Chinese customers. So the question for Blizzard, if they choose to act solely on the basis of current gains and losses of their customer base, is what percentage of customers will actually be informed, angry, AND motivated enough by what’s going on to actually boycott them? 
---
These are all super rough numbers, but they illustrate the basic issue behind your question. You might be right that Blizzard stands to lose more money by supporting China, but that is only true if a high enough percentage of people will walk away from their business, despite the fact that a large number of those customers potentially do not follow world news, or care enough about recent events, or believe that their personal interactions will make enough of a difference to matter, or agree with the apparent Reddit consensus on this issue.
---
Not in the EU.
---
Call your credit card company
---
Wow people are actually pissed off enough to rebel like this. I get where they're coming from, absolutely - I am also disgusted with the Hong Kong situation but.... Politics and gameplay are things that have nothing to do with each other. I wouldn't sacrifice my memories and current entertainment to "hurt" Blizzard. Maybe it's selfish, I don't know. But after Blizzard make an apology which will most probably happen given the situation, most of these people will want their accounts back. And that would be really really hard to do, if not impossible with the sheer number of people deleting their accounts. 
---
I'm not saying this to pity Blizzard, they deserve the hard work it will take to restore those accounts because what they did was not right. I'm saying this because some of these people may not get their accounts back at all and I think Blizzard is disabling the account deletion in favor of these people. They're already in the damage control stage two steps ahead.
---
Tankies: "THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE"
---
Examples pls?
---
I'm just cynical on this whole thing, that's all.
---
You don't have a clue how the stock market works, do you?
---
Honestly if they want to keep their employees and western fans a backtracking of their decision and a principled statement regarding their core values and human rights is probably the way to go (not suggesting that they should directly back the HK protests)
---
If this gets them banned in China I think this would have to escalate to the political level.
---
Any sort of try to please both sides is likely won't resolve the situation and won't help them getting political backing.
---
Whatever they do I think the reputational and financial damage will be significant.
---
Well, maybe not. But again, it's delusional at this stage that we would have any effect on China and their policies. That change must come from within.
---
&gt; extremes 
---
imagine thinking deleting your video game account is extreme
---
damn 
---
you should make this a post
---
not just comment
---
By definition, if they are in compliance with European privacy regulations, the accounts will be impossible to restore, since to follow the GDPR, they can't even keep any backups.
---
My geuss is that it was the esports team.
---
Yeah, they don't like you mentioning that tencent owns riot games over there. Or on fortnite for that matter
---
but people were mocking trump for his anti china charade, ive seen many posts on reddit that were arguing that USA is an equal threat to human rights as China. oh how the tables have turned
---
Because the people in a position to give them are actively disincentivised to make it affordable and because you have a population that has largely convinced itself that handicapping democratic processes is worth lessening the power of some potential tyrannical government
---
The individual employees who work on Overwatch may very well believe in what they are doing, it's the company as a whole that is only after money.
---
Well, at least you do not live in Russia, where we get jailtime for posting memes (even from 10 years ago), where we have internet lags in various games and services, because government company decided that they need to lock messenger that refused to disclose all the people confersations to government.
---
Because everything that is being organised here gets 90% of the budget stolen (our last Olympics got around 50 billions of US dollars stolen, out of 51), we do not have a proper system to block internet access to something (we never even had a proper roads). Instead they just go on and block hundreds of thousands of IP addresses from which messenger got proxied. Needless to say - messenger works fine. But occasionally you can only watch some twitch streams and play some games lag-free by using VPN.
---
Still, support this Hong-Kong backlash. People should be able to speak their mind freely, at least somewhere.
---
Really? That's pretty neat, I've only ever seen the four digit ones. Wonder if there's any three digit or lower battletags?
---
Well they've just cornered themselves hard. They can choose to withdraw the punishment and give the player and casters a lighter punishment, and give a fair warning and make the Chinese turn on them, or they can double down on it and make a statement that they won't do anything, pissing off the Western audience. 
---
But they're doing what Blizzard almost always does: Bunker down, don't say a word about it and pray it passes over and people forget. It's something they have always done, and they won't back down either.

The casters getting fired was really the turning point for me. Like if Blitz was the only one penalized maybe it would be less but the firing of both casters? That just proves it wasn’t about enforcing the rulers it was about sending a message. And that’s unacceptable.
---
It's very possible that the gains from standing with the communist party outweighs the loss of part of the western market.
---
The  league reddit is a dumpster fire, for a variety of reasons. If i want any kind of opinion on a league change, i go to one of their champ mains subreddits and see what they think.
---
lol I appreciate all the time and effort you decided to spend to write such long comments, the lack of empathy makes you pitiful.
---
There's more people viewing Hearthstone on Twitch than there was this time last week. While some of that is the new event, I think it shows that the boycott blizzard movement is either much smaller than this subreddit would have you believe, or that it's mostly casual players who have been doing all of the protesting.
---
Well...
---
Let see how blizzard's stock go
---
He already has made more money than many make in a lifetime. He'd be fine
---
What did blizzard do? I havent been following the drama.
---
Happy to live in a dictatorship, lol.
---
Yes, how dare they have some tight security around here! You seriously need to stop acting as if you showing them your ID card means your personal space is being breached. 
---
Imagine if ANYBODY could submit an account deletion without first identifying themselves, imagine the shit Blizzard would get because of it.
---
Remember that Blizzard is activision and activision is more evil than EA.

---
China viewbotting streams is a known phenomenon that is the reason tournament viewer stats have China and rest-of-the-world separated.
---
Bot accounts and paid shills are nothing new either.
---
This isn't necessarily what's going on, but I'd hazard a guess it is.
---
Well, what's happening right now is also a statement that the people are not ok with the Chinese government being able to pull strings almost anywhere.
---
People are being oppressed, they're having their rights violated. They are being assaulted, gased shot at, maimed, interned, vanished. People have lost their eyes, people are in hospital suffering enormous and permenant injury because of the brutality of the people charged with protecting them. There have been eight suicides as a direct response to China's encroachment on Hong Kong.
---
*"That seems extreme...."*

Heh, shows you that all the "woke corporate activism" in the west is merely chep lipsay to promote their products since its both hip and cheap as it plays right into the current Zeitgeist over here .... but oh boy, do they show clearly that they suck every communist dick there is when money is on the line if they'd have to take an actual stance for something.
---
That's absolutely not how things work in America. You have the right to freedom of speech at a public venue. You have the right to free speech at a government owned stadium even at a private event, if its open to the public. You can be kicked out if its a disruption to public safety or against the code of conduct, but it's the same standard the government is held to.
---
I hope this is trolling.

Or you can kill it with brawl.

You must fight for others today if you expect them to fight for you tomorrow.
---
I posted a 1\* review, yesterday and today it was gone, they are deleting the negative reviews...
---
Blizzard shut down protests on their live stream because their live stream is not a platform for political warfare. Full stop. Same rules apply for sport btw.
---
Or would you be totally fine with slogans like:"Support Kurds", "Russia! Leave Ukraine alone!" and "Impeach Trump" during esport events?
---
Inb4 blizzard removes mei from the game
---
You know what you just exercised? Your right to free speech. 
---
People in China dont get that at all look at hong kong. 
---
We cant just stand by and watch as the world slowly falls to China’s feet one company by one company. Actually youre correct were not freeing hong kong each time we say it online but we gain the attention needed to show the world the problem at hand which in turn we hopefully will gain enough attention to have something actually done.
---
How come you guys are not smashing ur iphones and boycotting apple as well?

Gotta farm those social credit scores.

Can someone explain how the 1/1 wolf with charge and taunt works?
---
Friendly reminder that Thijs took the exact opposite response, despite being completely financially secure (with his huge viewerbase, he is undoubtedly a one-percenter).  He simply doesn't care about the people of Hong Kong enough to even step away for a few days or find a new game to stream.
---
Preemptive friendly reminder that Kibler's comment about not dragging in streamers, employees, etc. isn't relevant to someone in Thijs' financial position; he's in the same situation as Kripp and Kibler financially.  Again, he simply doesn't care about the people of Hong Kong more than his cushy streaming position, which he is more than capable of adapting.
---

Also, good for you, i was not able to stop my self from purchasing SC2 full campaign after finishing SC1 and bought OW as a present to my self since they gave me a closed beta pass and that it got release on my birthday. and that i'm still thinking about WC3 reforge

People with dark skin are being viewed ... "differently" in many parts of Asia, highly negative and racist in fact, without going into too much detail into why. A black hero doesn't bode well, hence the face coverup on the poster.

It’s all well and good to write comments like this but not everyone is in a financial position where they can afford to lose their primary source of income.
---
Yes. Everyone knows that companies are a bunch of parasites and care more for profits than people. But that's where the people come in. Will you support a company like that or not? That's the issue here. It seems like there are some people out there that care more about playing a game that has no relevance to reality than they care about people's freedom or even their own rights.
---
Standing for or against a company like Blizzard will speak volumes about the people. If they sit back and do nothing about this then it sets a new precedent for companies. The people would then be willing to give up more and more freedoms as long as they can disconnect themselves from reality and how "unjust" they feel about it, even though they themselves lead to those circumstances in the first place.

What will people be willing to give up next for the sake of "escaping reality"?

No because as long as the accounts exist they're still a net positive for Blizzard to parade to their investors.

The 10K Statement is filed by publically traded corporations. It is a legal document that is a federal crime to exclude and otherwise commit fraud by not including *all the numbers correctly.*
---
How much you get paid for this add?
---
No they are not, its open to the public and its a government owned building. You have freedom of speech rights at stuff like this and sporting events. It's more restricted, but its not the same as kicking people out their own property. The code of conduct for the Anaheim convention center allows for it and they can't restrict beyond it.
---
I didn't? Lmao.
---
Man that's fucked up on China's part, but I do want to point out I don't know if this is going to work as well. This Pooh Bear thing looks like it's specifically targeting Xi, who it sounds like has very thin skin. I can only imagine that HK does a lot of these "turn icons into pro HK things" and I just don't see China giving a shit about fan made Mei stuff especially if Blizzard would reign it in or make it clear that's not part of their game. It's not even really targeting Xi, who I feel like is the main reason Pooh got banned. But I can't say for sure, maybe I'm wrong. Time will tell, I suppose.

Fucking with young peoples' hobbies is the only way to get them to take anything seriously.  Look at all the teenage edgelords posting funny Trump memes, laughing about horrible shit he did etc,  but as soon as he suggested a vaping ban(lmao) they all turned on him immediately.

It's not the same company you fell in love with. Don't worry, do the right thing (whatever is right in your heart).

I can't do that in my country.

Now you are free and got a lot of time doing better and more interesting things than playing blizzard games.

You're the most reasonable pearson I talked to in a while. I guess you're right. But it's just sad. Sorry if I offended you in any way, I didn't mean to. I don't even play HS that often, but I get so much emotions and good vibes from it, that I feel like smb is trying to steal it from me.

As an English person, I'm tired of hearing American banding "free speech" around like it means anything. If I went to Blizzcon wearing a T-shirt with a racist remark on, could I just pass that off as "free speech" and not expect to be thrown out?

They can't unless they have access to your email as well.

So what everyone should do is start openly supporting hk until they ban you. It’s the only way to delete their account after all
---
Probably,
---
I am surprised it didn't happen till now though, this seemed like an emergency from 2 days ago already and I would believe that Blizzard would pay premium to get help asap.

Also, what about their own PR team? we barely heard anything from them.

If your in the UK asked them to delete your account via GDPR they are legally obliged to

 This blew up WAY out of control and way bigger than they likely ever expected it's made some of the big news channels in the States and had media coverage in many other parts of the world, senators have talked about it, it's gained absolutely insane traction on reddit (over 160k upvotes on the post on all last I checked) and if even half the people claiming they're boycotting blizzard are to believe they've lost a shit ton of business. What this means is they've likely brought together a PR firm to come up with a response because it's essentially a company crisis that could cost them many millions - if not more - in revenue. They should have a response out by the end of the week presumably, expect it to have some of the most artful PR speak you've ever seen and say nothing of actual substance at all.

Because NetEase made a post on Weibo using the official Hearthstone Weibo account in support of China. If Blizzard comes out to say that, they will have to denounce what NetEase said on their behalf. Because, even if it was NetEase who manages and posts in Weibo, it is still under the Hearthstone brand, which is still under Blizzard and thusly something they cannot just shrug away.
---
Also not to mention, that would fully cut Blizzard away from future ties to China and thus a huge loss of potential revenue.

You've been awarded 100 social credits. Keep up your good work.

We can actively try to stop and reduce what we buy but obviously just because people still wear clothes doesn't mean they don't care about human rights. GFY you're probably a Chinese bot anyway.
---
Dude you are supporting so many apprehensive companies with your money. Big Oil, Big Pharma, MSM, Big Data, Nestle and co, Foxconn and co, etc etc.
---
Compared to those, Blizzard is a lamb.
---
People like to hang onto those isolated cases when they are at the center of the spotlight because they want to elevate themselves and show off their morality. I wouldnt take this too seriously.
---
tbh it doesn't matter if freedom "should" be free by historical rights.
---
There's an article from the UN that recognizes the right to self-determination. This often overlooked article means that any people, including Hong Kong, has the right to choose how to govern itself - be it by being part of China, by being an "autonomous region" within a country, by being their own country or whatever. The point is that they are the ones that choose. China can administer Hong Kong only if people living there want it to be the case.
---
Read the flair, my friend. It was satirical.

Most people couldn't possibly see Blizzcon being more a failure than the 2018 Blizzcon, but they've managed it. Their behaviour is going to make last year's Blizzcon look like a major success.

Yes and no. While a trade war with China was inevitable, it shouldn't of happened until we had our global allies willing to join in as well. The odds of us winning it by ourself are slim. Also, he picked the absolute worst reason to enter a trade war, currency manipulation. The trade war should have been about weakening China's influence on the global economy (so they can't bully companies like they do now), human rights violations, and the fact that they are by far the largest producer of greenhouse gases on the planet. So unfortunately, even if we somehow win this trade war, not a whole lot will happen long-term.
---
That's some free speach heroism there ...   
---

---
There's a very large chance that the massive amount of cancellations have cause something to crash on Blizzard's end, and that's what is happening here. I'm all on the Blizzard hate train, but this is probably a tech problem.
---
yeah, every Scandinavian language has the same thing, but anglos never mention those lol.
---
They already do that in production constantly showing relevant cards
---
One did, idk about the other..
---
Totally. Punishment was very harsh and very swift, but they do have rules in place for not pushing political agendas.
---
We may not get another chance for these companies to change course once china starts to make up more of their revenue. This B.S is happening with China only contributing about 15% of company income....imagine how untouchable Blizzard would act if they succeed in plans that would mean more than 50% of income come from China. That's not a hollow possibility, that kind of potential is the exact reason these companies are shilling so hard for China now.

Huge respect.

It's a shame Blizzcon isn't sooner.

---
I'm sure no one will read this but for most of my life I have been the "Hur durh games shouldnt have politics" / "Virtue Signalling lololo" kind of guy but this + some legal changes in my own country has really made me look at my lack of action towards actually supporting my political views. I want to do better. Hopefully donating and this boycott can be a small way to start.
---
you are an ignorant idiot like all those sheeps here on the Internet , virtual signaling does nothing , you truly believe boycotting Blizzard will help those people in Hong Kong ? you must be outta your damn mind son , if you REALLY wanna make a DIFFERENCE , go take a Ticket to Hong Kong and SUPPORT them and not sit here and playing a keyboard warrior you loser .
---
Assuming this was posted to an official Hearthstone social media account by a business entity Blizzard has authorized to post to that account (and since Blizzard hasn't sued NetEase for the use of their IP, presumably both are true), the title of the post is 100% fair and accurate. Until Blizzard repudiates the official statement of their business partner who is authorized to represent them in China, it's not reasonable to claim this isn't an official Blizzard statement -- it is so by definition.

---
Good. I was worried some decision was going to be made that "protest time is over" after a laughably short period of time.
---
I'm mad. **I'm only growing more mad, not less.** I didn't *choose* to quit Hearthstone - Blizzard *stole* Hearthstone from us by making it impossible to enjoy in good conscious. Would you stop being mad that something you loved was suddenly and unexpectedly taken from you, when they have the power to make it right? No. Every day is another day that Blizzard have chosen to actively block us from a game we enjoy playing. This is an active ongoing attack on us until they choose to do the right thing and make this right.
---
I get it, it’s hard to leave work you’ve put into something. I played WoW pretty damn religiously for about 7 years and then got married and my husband hates wow so I moved over to GW2. 
---
At first I was hesitant but now I’m glad I made the switch almost 5 years ago because now I feel gw2 is a way better game and the community is much nicer. Then this shit happened, hah even more happy I quit supporting their shit long ago. 
---
I’m glad you’re doing the right thing here though, especially since blizzard apparently does not have the balls to stand up for human rights. 
---
I wish you the best of luck and I hope you find some new games that are enjoyable even more so than any of theirs ever were. (Sucks though we were contemplating playing over watch awhile back too lol, oh well on that)
---
&gt; it's not like they stand to lose their entire business elsewhere
---
Actually they do. Politicians are getting attention and it IS possible they will punish Blizzard for complicity with Chinese government to a degree that has already happened to Huawei. Blizzard can very well be banned from doing business if they appear to bend over so much they can't be trusted to not spy for China.
---
Piggybacking off the top comment for the US, you can report I’m sure but what will really get their attention is credit card chargebacks.
---
That is I point out to them that peace has also the sense of death and so one should hesitate about desiring it, in particular above justice? But I like your interpretation too.
---
Fair enough ;)
---
No, this is how the *People's Republic of China* treats dissidents.
---
But they don't even get graves, they get harvested and liquidated.
---
I dont know about them egging him on but to my knowledge they ducked down as to not be associated with the statement. 
---
I'm personally past this aspect of the controversy I think the bigger issue is that there has been no official statement other than the one basically aligning themselves with China (which is a political statement on its own) If bliz was innocent in this matter they would be actively trying to rectify it with actions.
---
I hope to hear the crowds chanting HK support during presentations. Except if there's a D4 presentation. I want to hear that.
---
Proof.
---
That's not even remotely true. Stock prices can move a lot even on the base of a tiny rumor. They also move mostly based on EXPECTATIONS, not actual results (which are reported only a few times per year). 
---
Stock price isn't some hard number based on real values - people who hold them are in control of the price after all. I don't believe that anyone who holds a significant amount of Blizzard stocks hasn't heard about the whole thing yet. If they thought that it was a big deal, they would sell and the price would drop. But they didn't. It moved -0.8%, which is perfectly normal and insignificant. Stock prices have a much bigger daily moves without any information whatsoever. 
---
Of course, it might be the beginning of a downwards trend, but for now nothing implies that. On the contrary, I think that Blizzard standing against China would have a much bigger impact on their stock, since they would turn their back to a huge market.
---
That's nonsense.  
---
I support the current government is very much a political statement...  
---
It's a conflict picking a side is a statement.
---
I pick a side is a political statement.
---
The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.
---
Yes, yes you can. I very much support the people in HK, but I've already bought and paid for my games, so it's not that blizz are getting any more money from me. You can enjoy what you already have. It's smart to stay up on current events, but I don't think a GAME is morally bankrupt just because the company behind it has gone that way.
---
By China? No. “For” China. China doesn’t control blizzard but blizzard wants to please China.
---
Love it!

How do you compare a fake ID vs a real ID? How do you know what the person looks like to begin with? What do you do with the ID once done?

---
Exactly. A trade war was inevitable but he picked the worst possible way to enter it and the worst possible motive.
---
I honestly understand why we can't openly side with HK as that would complicate our trade talks to the detriment of our economy
---
Think of it similar to how our support of Kurds in Syria pissed off Turkey who hates them and now that we've withdrawn troops they're massing to take them out
---
To which our President says we will punish them economically if they do so
---
Now if we openly support HK China would attempt to destroy us economically and socially using the current political divide to their advantage
---
Sorry to hear, I quite frankly had no idea. Fixed.
---
Well, it depends on the severity and readyness of the punishment. In the case of blizzard most can agree that it was too harsh of a punishment and too fast (compared to other worse offenders, like cheaters,etc)
---
Basically the size of their response made it look like they were defending China, and the silence after the backlash isn't helping (but that might be because of blizzcon being soon)
---
With your post:

---
Look at the list posted further up in those comments and go through it. To effectively tell companies dealing with China is not broadly acceptable, you'd have to stop monetary influx to all those sources. There has to be a direct corellation between working with China and losing business.
---
But so much effort is focused on Blizzard now that other companies are *still* acting with reasonable impunity.
---
You haven't changed the system by deinstalling Blizzard games and going back to Riot. Or spending those £10 for a subscription to watch a movie in cinemas. 95% of big companies deal with China in one way or another. So going away from one and spending it at another is not a solution. Nothing leaves the system. You're just redistributing it within.

As you say, continuing to ban people from playing heathstone would not at all seem like a wise thing to do.
---
That means, they are no longer applying this rule.  That in turn means that they have applied this rule Unequally.

That was my point.  There are more examples, but honestly i'm not here to write lists for you, i think my point is clear, you are welcome to disagree if you want.  Unlike in Blitzchung's case, disagreement is your right.

Kibler has the following and influence to ensure his response/thoughts are heard and shared. A regular person simply does not have that privilege or impact and thus have to use alternative methods to capture blizzard's attention. Did Kibler respond the way he did because of the US China trade wars and/or the recent NBA incident? Unlikely. So why is it hard to believe the community reacted the way it did because ppl share the same opinions as Kibler.
---
and we found that guy....
---
Blizzard is acting as a censorship puppet for the Chinese government, and you're trying to claim they did nothing wrong. Why don't you do some research before making an uneducated moronic post like this
---
Yeah you're gonna provide sources, right?
---
The last time that they were publically involved with Riot was when they were a server status chatroom and when they hired 1 mod after he had left the mod team for a while already. 
---
There was a stickied thread for people to talk about the HS drama and multiple threads up abou the HKA drama. They make some bad decisions but saying they're in bed with Riot a stretch of reality unless you have some new evidence.
---
I see. That was just... sad. I am glad that the people around me are different.

Hate speech is just as nebulous as the terms that Blizzard used to punish Blitzchung

Frankly, most overseas Tibetan are all Nobles of old Tibetan society including Dala Lama. Their fathers enslaved and tortured Tibetan people before CCP entered Tibet. Tibetan people acquired land and wealth from nobles after CCP free them. They are not slaves of nobles.So all the overseas Tibetan nobles hate CCP today. But Tibetan people who live in Tibet take the opposite attitudes toward CCP because their fathers were slaves.

Yeah it is awesome, I've also deleted my hearthstone account and dusted all my cards. It feels so good to do my part in making the world a better place.
---
They’re gonna play it off as trying to keep politics out of esports but the reality is this is a human rights crisis.
---
This isn't true, it was just a temporary technical outage.   
---
What they have done is disgusting but let's not turn into conspiracy theorists.
---
Sorry I already forgot
---
What constitutes news and discussion?
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfw039/day_2_do_not_let_this_die_do_not_let_hong_kong_be/
---
That for example isn't news and discussion is very generous.  It's just drum beating.  If posts like that are going to be everywhere, can we get a specific filter for them?  I'm just not interested in this subreddit being the arm of /r/hongkong.
---
Thanks for letting this shit ruin the sub for a while much appreciated mods!
---
For sure in blizzard are scared of such a "competitor"
---

Seems a bit premature,  no?
---
It's been what, three our four days? And each day for them is worse than the last. They could reverse course or amend their action any day now but you wouldn't be able to recover your stuff.
---
Money is all a company cares about. Want to punish a company? Stop giving them money. Deleting your own shit is... I doubt that, internally, they are pulling metrics on that. Their board and significant shareholders certainly don't care if you delete your shit. *They* are only going to notice if revenue goes down.
---
In an article yesterday it said that China represented ~12% of Blizzard's income. Maybe that was a few years old though, or maybe we should put it what Blizzard thinks it will be in the future. Say China represents the possibility of being 25% of Blizzard's income. It's just one country and tons of it isn't playing video games but it's a big damn country and so we'll go with a high estimate.
---
To make Blizzard change course, a boycott has to threaten more than that. Think you can get ~1 in 3 people in the US and EU to stop paying Blizzard as a response to this? If you do, their shareholders will cave and tell Blizzard leadership to forget China until/unless they recover their base.
---
I'm afraid I can only 'contribute' so much to this as I've always hated Blizzard and never given them a dime. They aren't going to notice me not giving them money now. I promise I won't start though. I won't cancel out anyone's boycott.
---
“Most of the people boycotting haven’t spent money since uldum or even before that.”
---
Ummm no.
---
I made an extra donation to the 612 humanitarian fund just for you. [Proof](https://imgur.com/a/XhmuEPB). Thanks for your support :D.

"Terrorism is, in the broadest sense, the use of intentional violence, generally against civilians, for political purposes." In my case and the actual case there where no violence but otherwise the definition fits both cases.
---
Deleting your account is a little extreme for something you will forget about in a week.
---
The world is very odd when a statement objects to the display of personal beliefs in support of the ongoing loss of personal freedoms.
---
No you're not, if you were you would care about future of gaming, you're just here to troll.
---
[Just one action doesn't amount to much but together they add up.](https://youtu.be/Zp8_FzJO458)  I'm sure you are smart enough to understand that, right?
---
Agreed. I’m not getting back on hearthstone or any other Activision Blizzard game until they reverse this and provide a clear statement to the world they are done being bullied by the Chinese market. 
---
I’m doing the same for Apple, Disney/ESPN, and a lot of other brands. The only hard one is apple. I’ve had the same iPhone for 4 years and don’t feel like spending more money. So I’ll continue to use it. But I’ll avoid the App Store (hardly make purchases anyway. Usually just download free apps) and continue to focus on the Cydia store and third party sideloaded (open source not pirated) apps for my needs. 
---
The only thing they care about is money so that’s exactly what I’ll deny them. If they want the China market so bad I hope they can make do with only the China market. 
---
Stay strong. Our wallets are what matter at this point so don’t be the doof who decides to be complacent for the sake of your convenient 1st World Western lifestyle.
---
I disabled mine about 7 hours ago. They only asked for an ID.
---
Tbh blizz and China really pissing me off rn it’s killing my vibe
---
Blizzard censored it
---
I know, right? It takes a special kind of cool to be given power and then not use it indiscriminately when things get dicey. 
---
Massive kudos to the mod team, not just for being good mods, but presumably good people underneath all that.
---
What China is doing with censorship is wrong and corporations capitulating to them is even worse.    
---
However aren't the Hong Kong Protesters defending an admitted murderer when they oppose a very normal extradition treaty between China and Hong Kong?  Most normal countries have extradition treaties don't they?
---
How much you wanna bet that this will all be forgotten by the same time next week?
---
Most conservatives I know are really passionate about video games
---
I'd say I'm more conservative than liberal and I play video games a lot too.....
---
But sigh, some people on this thread are just shitting on conservatives and not recognising that we support Hong Kong too....
---
You ever went outside and go to a Demonstration?
---
Yeah they did. They tried to make it seem so you're sending a random photograph to Blizzard whole we're discussing a deterrent to prevent impersonating someone else to destroy  digital information.
---
Well, I mean they try. Nobody learns magic from watching pro tour streams :/ and it can be kinda hard to run overlays for thousands of possible cards in the draft sections.
---
What's CR?
---
Green man good
---
Spoken like someone who has never lived in rural America. Until you have, you will not understand why conservatives see any attempt to ban guns as an affront to their safety and freedom.
---
Unfortunately many people who would have done it yesterday will have lost interest today. Blizzard's tactic worked, they swindled a bit more money.
---
&gt;they do have rules in place for not pushing political agendas
---
Wait, really?  They have rules specifically forbiding people to promote any political agenda?  Cause if they do, why the fuck didn't they cite *those* rules instead of the super questionable "at out sole discretion, this offended parts of the community"? I am confused.
---
Do you have a link to the rule you're thinking of?  I'd be interested to look into this more.
---
If you think about it, squint and bang your head against the wall hard all life in the universe is at stake with the CCP. Maybe the next Hong Kong will be Blaxkot 7, home of the innocent Blaxkotians with their delicious street food and lack of oppressive government regimes. Big brain time \*taps forehead which has started bleeding from banging it against the wall\*
---
ok, let's see how long this conversation keeps going. Just like every other attempt at slacktivism by selfless Reddit users.
---
highjacking top comment to post ways we can help abroad:
---
**How we can help**
---
If you want to help the people in Hong Kong and are US, EU or UK citizen, you can urge your representative to pass:
---
•	⁠[US] Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019 [[H.R. 3289](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3289?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), [S. 1838](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1838?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)]. You can use this website to [send a pre-composed letter](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/co-sponsor-hong-kong-human-rights-and-democracy-act-of-2019?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).
---
•	⁠[EU] Joint Motion for a Resolution on the situation in Hong Kong [RC-9-2019-0013_EN](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/RC-9-2019-0013_EN.html?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).

---
•	⁠Or just spread the words about the situation in Hong Kong to people you know. That's already very helpful.
---
This is [an example](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cjj9f3/us_bill_to_impose_sanctions_on_chinese_and_hong/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) where your involvement helped the people of Hong Kong.
---
We really appreciate your help!
---
Yet.
---
The first time this happens in an MTGA tournament, it'll happen. They've been pretty circumspect about it so far in paper MTG and MTGO tournaments, but reaction to political protest re: China hasn't really happened much in those yet, either. Wizards is watching this and will probably be more moderate, but the protester, when it happens, will be at least somewhat penalized for the same reasons Blizzard (not China Blizzard, but the mothership) has given so far. Same thing with that Gods Unchained company if it ever gets big enough to matter.
---
same for me, 1 second over for the fire festival :)
---
LGTB &gt; Human Rights
---
So sacrificing something is worse than sacrificing nothing?  This is just a common argument to make people feel better about making the decision to do literally nothing.  And it's garbage.
---
Probably a combo of people who want to jump on the next rage train and a combo of a few paid shills by EA and co. To get this whole thing started. Easy money for them
---
In that case you are screwed.
---
 But I would say most people have at least bought *something* *somewhere* in Battlenet. Be it an active wow subscription or microtransactions in Hearthstone.
---
And with that they would have a billing address that they can compare to your ID.
---
Its probably so that its easier to add more weapons later on, without having to repeat the "loses 1 health after attacking" code every time.
---
I was thinking the same thing but didn't want to go full conspiracy. China is super evil and I support HK, but I would not be surprised if it comes out the CIA or some such organization has been meddling in it. We live in the age of meme warfare.
---
GAMERS RISE UP
---
This is the last thing you see before your eyes are harvested for the great Pooh Bear!
---
They use four boards taped together.
---
Well I don't plan to do that I'm mentally sound enough
---
Because people who play HS aren’t the ones spending millions investing in blizzard stock. 
---
I did sell my shares though...because at blizzcon I can see it being a shit show, and the stock got whacked after the diablo blizzcon.
---
And in two months from now, nobody will care about this.
---
Downvote this comment if you agree.
---
Yeah, here's the list to help stay of the US companies gaining profits from China
---
 [https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/the-most-popular-american-companies-in-china](https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/the-most-popular-american-companies-in-china) 
---
just don't stop fighting!
---
This is how they know if you're an organ donor.
---
Because the core problem here is that they put money above all else, even human rights in this case, but if they reverse the decision because of the protests, it will also be because of money, not because they had a change of heart on the issue. They will just do something like this again.
---
Yeah 
---
A lot peoples already talk about it (included kibler and kripp). Blizzard should just make a soft ban as a warning instead of nuclear him and now they get what they deserved
---
/u/scarletbliss have you or the other mods heard from your Blizzard partners about this sub and it's content or have they been silent with you as well?
---
Okay so capitalism wont rule the world forever much like feudalism didn't.  It will be replaced by a fairer better system (socialism) . The best you can do is sell everything you own but a ticket fly over to China and assassinate the Chinese president . Although you will probably then be tortured to death . So marching In the streets is the best your willing to do . Deinalling a game and not purchasing blizzard products will hurt there profits . That is fact . This discourages other companys from supporting china making it easier for Hong kong protesters to protest .
---
Here is a video on virtue signaling and how it's a term that's practically meaningless . However I'm willing to guess your probably not gonna watch it 
---
https://youtu.be/sAmM872874A
---
Any anti authoritarian support is good . Stop "virtue signalling" by telling us you support Tibet.
---
It's fair to be honest not many of us would stand up and immediately leave our jobs if we found out a co worker was just fired for being pro Hong Kong. Its not that easy to bring sudden hardships on your family. If you plan on only making a living dealing with upstanding moral companies it's going to be a bad time.
---
So if you are going to keep enjoying those things, why is it wrong for OP to enjoy hearthstone?
---
What? He effectively lost 75% of his dust, not 90%, and he's got more than enough to make multiple competitive decks.
---
You guys need to keep meme'ing Mei as a Hong Kong protester.
---
That's powerful shit right there. If OW gets banned in China, that'll hurt Blizz a shit ton.
---
Why does this remind me of that episode of Black Mirror “Nosedive”. This is scary stuff
---
People are actually deleting thier accounts this time. That is real action that shouldnt be ignored
---
I don't like shitty ones, no.
---
I'm guessing it's because he spoke up about Blizzard's action in China, and generally what is going on in the shady chinese gaming industry, thus jeopardizing his own compagny on this market.
---
So, as he said, he stood up against this bullshit, as we should too.
---
"Anything I like my enemy hates. Anything I hate my enemy loves."
---
Reddit is not.
---
HS sub is not.
---
But 3HK has no direct connection to HS.
---
Remember that even if you can't deactivate your account you can stop playing/stop paying. Pay for nothing. Battlefields should be empty. Forums should be littered with "Free Hong Kong" and Mei memes. Keep testing to see if you can deactivate you account and as soon as it's possible do it!
---
Epic Games has said it will not censor users. Everyone switch over to Fortnite! (I have never played, but today I'll be making an account!)
---
I’m moving to mtga

In germany it was also the law for jews to be sent to the camps. We don't take "oh just following the law" as an excuse. Even for rosa parks people didn't take this shit from their government either. And like I say blizzard is able to enforce their laws selectively. This is clearly a move to please china, no matter what you say. 
---
And yes I understand how you feel, this is very annoying. But keep in mind that people don't usually tend to act on an issue until it affects them personal. I do not think you should judge people's motives since this really might be the first time somebody really looked at chinese enroachment.
---
There's a very live push to make Mei from Overwatch a mascot for Hong Kong protests. If it catches on Blizzard will have to address that elephant eventually. 
---
If the goal is to hold Activision-Blizzard accountable for capitulation, than this needs to spread to all their IPs.
---
#freehongkong and #boycottblizzard should be trending on twitter until Blizzcon
---
I have to say I only play Diablo and old school Warcraft but I too feel Blizzard did wrong and fully support #freehongkong and #boycottblizzard
---
Your name is actually TrumpImpeachedAugust? And your account is 2 years old? As in you really thought Trump would get impeached in 6 months? Bahahaha
---
This goes even beyond just gaming or business or following rules and regulations.
---
China is a nazi country doing literal nazi things.
---
When history books are (hopefully) written on the rise (and hopefully also fall) of nazi China, which side of history do you want to remember yourself having stood on?
---
The amount of mental gymnastics to post some bullshit like this is astounding.
---
Shut up already
---
Inb4 [removed]
---
&gt; and then they posted about "Protecting China's pride".
---
this is literally made up. It wasn't a Blizzard account which made that statement, it was a netease account.
---
Don't forgive and don't forget. Vow to never buy a Blizzard product again. I see redditors complain about greedy capitalists all the time, but they forget after a month. How many of you are still buying Nestle products or EA games? Even better, pirate those games.
---
Is it too late/even possible to refund blizzcon tickets? I've never bought any but that would seem like a good course of action
---
Pretty simple to me. Everybody who weren't a part of the decision are innocent to me.
---
Same with nazi soldiers. The individual who were forcefully drafted isn't to blame at all. Many of those who refused at the end of the war were hung to death on lamp posts to deter others.
---
Not letting me put a reason for my deletion, but the request is processing currently despite me sending a picture of some boots to lick instead of my ID 
---
If it doesn’t go through, oh well, time to spam deletion requests until it does 🤷‍♂️
---
While CDPR did censor stuff for china in the past (artwork) I think the company is one of the only good ones left out there. Gwent is a good game as well, although it changed a lot from the witcher 3 one.
---
Blizzard: "We need a couple of days to decide whether or not we support dictatorships and lack of basic human rights, thank you for your patience."
---
Gotta share it wherever we can! Stay strong and keep the pressure up!
---
Step one for me was canceling my wow account and deleting hearth stone. Figuring out what to do today to keep the momentum
---
I wouldn't take that statement genuinely at all. It's just free good press without actually having to take a stand on anything.
---
twats making incredibly safe PR moves isn't good behavior
---
Is Blizzard really keeping people from deleting their account? From what I could tell some of the authentication options were not working but people were still able to get their requests accepted.
---
Question what does this accomplish? Wouldn't it be the same if not more beneficial to simply boycott Blizzard products and never give them any more money.
---
meanwhile you have millions of chinese making a new Account because of the new mobile COD Game.
---
Kibbler stepped down from casting.  
---
http://bmkgaming.com/statement-on-blitzchung/

---
The only thing I've seen from kripp is a tweet saying he supports HK.   
---
https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sr1h75
---
We need to actually actively downvote hearthstone content. Once people see stupid stream clips again they'll clap and giggle like toddlers playing with plastic keys and it'll all be for naught. This game doesn't deserve to have players anymore.
---
world war 3
---
The ONLY reason for blizzards silence is that they are hoping internet apathy and outrage culture will cause everyone to just forget and move on.
---
Don’t let them get away with this!
---
Wow bro you're super woke! Have +20 woke points!
---
The problem with "regulated capitalism" is that it maintains a powerful class of people whose fiscal and political goals are reducing those regulations to make more profit.
---
Every online TCG is a hearthstone competitor. 
---
I've never seen the Twitch metric used though, lul.
---
You're right we should just go full communist like china then there would be no problem /s
---
Nah i'm fine . I enjoy Blizzard games and i can give two shits about what they do . I pay them for one thing and that's to make good games . I don't expect from them to be pillars or role models of morality , I expect them to make good games.
---
It's probably the right choice.  You want a trim, efficient deck with a good curve.  The normal dungeon runs fatten it out with slower bosses that require bigger decks to beat.  The idea in the brawl is to run over the boss ASAP.
---
Heres a question - Whats a good blizzard replacement? Anyone got any gave devs they follow coming out with anything interesting?
---
Blizzard: Hey guys please keep politics out of of the pro scene. Thanks.
---
Reddit: OMFG Blizzard is literally sucking Chinese cock and killing innocent HKers!!!
---
Guess they never heard about the https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect
---
It isn't like that at all, I don't need someone to "clean my concious" so I can enjoy playing a f2p game. I'm not giving Blizzard money. Me logging or not logging into the game is not going to have an impact on the world, I believe.
---
I just believe Blizz has rules in place for reasons, someone broke their rule, they punished them with what is written for breaking that rule. They are a video game company trying to make money and someone making such comments can offend part of their audience or create controversy which they don't want. I don't think Blizz's actions have been THAT so outrageously unreasonable to the point where we need to boycott the company. 
---
I don't know about the casters and what they should have done, whether they were being prompted/asked to cut to break or whatever else was going on at the time. It seems like they let him do it and knew it was going to happen, though.
---
I actually saw someone walking around with a gas mask this morning while getting to school. I think its a great way to spread to movement.
---
&gt; What that guy did is equal to someone yelling out something about "jihad"
---
It's time to get off the computer, Boomer dad.
---
As a non-consumer of blizzard products, thank you all who are willing to put aside your personal enjoyment to make a collective point.  Easy for me to say F Blizzard but even if its a minor sacrifice, every sacrifice is appreciated and meaningful.  Stay strong Hong Kong!
---
I literally only found out it was a thing yesterday. Small town life
---
Wait, what happened with Brian "Brian Kibler" Kibler?
---
&gt; They'll just mitigate their risk by removing non blizzarx employees from their broadcasts. Once people start holding up free hk signs in the audience at events im sure we won't even get a pan of the audience anymore.
---
There's a reason they haven't done all that already: it's bad for business. The point is to make sure that Blizzard can either 
---
A) Take increasingly aggressive actions censorhip actions, at the cost of their NA playerbase, or  
---
B) Give up access to the Chinese market
---
Since governments aren't much involved, it's our job as consumers to make them pick B (unless we'd much rather have A).
---
I can see them not supporting Hong Kong. I cannot see them retroactively stealing the guys salary. Other sports act more mature. If there is politics in places where it does not belong, there can be temporary bans and fines.
---
Instead of choosing a sane route, blizzard tried to murder the guy.
---
Pordenone.... shit town full of braindead fucks, let me know if you need any help! I'd love to try spreading awareness about this (in inglese perché più gente possa capire)
---
Exactly, certain people are trying to get control over every aspect of life in america. Like for example taking over health care, the education system, housing and some even want to take away constitutional rights.
---
No, I don't know how he "violated the rules" because there is no publicly available record of Blizzards decision making in this regard. With what Blizzard has done in the last 24hrs, I believe like majority of the people, that they are doing this to stay on China's good side, but I'm not going to accept my beliefs as facts, because facts need proof.
---
If someone can provide any proof of Blizzard saying "ban him or we're fucked in China, then I'll accept it as fact, until then it will just be the most likely scenario.
---
BOTTOM TEXT THE PRC
---
!remindme 1 day
---
In the same boat, want to account delete but don't want to send my ID.
---
According to a lot of social media posts, all verification methods needed to delete your account have been disabled. (Correct me if I'm wrong and they enabled it again, but this is the last I saw of it).
---
But it does make a difference. It's inevitable that Blizzard is going to have to make some kind of about-face or risk alienating their entire market outside of the PRC. None of this backlash would be happening if it weren't for people taking a stand and telling them to fuck off. I can't understand your bitter response to this and your cynicism seems to be coming from a place external to the discussion. Don't you think it's a good thing that people are being outspoken about oppression and human rights violations.
---
Are the start passives (before boss 1) fixed for every boss or random? What possible passives can I get? (Like Dr. Boom with "equip a random weapon and give it +1/+1")
---
You guys are crying over a video game about something you would have never known about. Stfu. This was going on well before your stupid ass streamer got involved. Stop acting like blizzard is to blame.
---
CHINA NUMBER 4
---
They stripped all his winnings from their own tournament and fired the casters...does that seem like appropriate punishment?
---
&gt;Epic games/Fortnite have been vocal against Blizzard for what they did, and the main guy has said he's not the kinda guy to bow to pressure from a shareholder over something like that. He's still the primary shareholder and makes the exeutive decisions, so he can choose not to listen to the 48%, and he's doing just that.
---
All of this is just baseless words from Tim. And as Tim has shown the last decade, he routintely and actively goes against what he says.
---
It doesn't matter that he still has voting control in his company. China's 40% puts much more pressure on him than he wants to admit. If I was being controlled by China, I'd try my best to keep a straight face and tell everyone everything is fine too
---
I don't know I think solitaire is a pretty good competitor
---
I would prefer pros who did not wish to speak out acted like Tom did.  
---
Although it's not the message everyone wants to hear, he is doing the right thing.  
---
He is being honest, open, and he's not burying his head. We know he has things that he wishes he was in a position to say, and I think that that is as good as we can realistically expect from someone who is in his position.  
---
Props to Tom, and I'm sure if he ever feels comfortable discussing his feelings on the issue in the future, he will find lots of ears willing to listen. To any other pros who find themselves in a similar position, we will respect the honesty of messages like these, because we understand you need to look after yourselves.
---
I don't know why the public opinion on reddit will now be one-sided. Do everyone think that those people in Hong Kong are just "protesting"? Doesn't anyone think that there is nothing wrong with political speech in sports competitions? If such an event is replaced by an independent speaker in another country, will the situation be different?
---
I admit that I am a Chinese student studying in Canada. I know about the history of Hong Kong, so I hope that everyone can rethink this incident instead of following the mainstream thinking.
---
My last post about my opinion has been deleted by Reddit.
---
I personally realized that this might affect blizzards stocks. To be 100%  honest my initial interest was in not wanting to lose money. But as i was doing my research of whether i truly wanted to sell or not, i decided that i didn't care whether it was going to "do well" or "bounce back". I decided at that moment that I wasnt going to directly support this company. Truly take there money from them. (Idk if this would actually hurt them, but I feel like between this and boycotting their games I am doing a good thing)

---
I mean, it feels like flushing thousands of dollars and years of my life down the drain. But it's whatever. I need to quit anyway.
---
honestly, this whole thing has blown up on reddit more due to reddit "me-too"ism to farm karma than anything, if you ask me.  So many of the posts and comments ring hollow to me because it definitely feels like it's all "CHINA BAD UPBOATS TO THE LEFT THANKS"
---
Don't get me wrong, I think what china is doing is horrible and hong kong deserves their democracy, but this is another reddit karma race as we've seen many times in the past.  Do people care about this issue?  I don't doubt it one bit, but is the response we see on reddit genuine or is it just more (and i know i'll get tagged as some regressive troll for using this term but i can't think of another way to say it) virtue signalling?  I don't know.
---
I'm just suggesting my dude... I'm not saying people "must" (which Blizzard did).

Apparently the make you submit your ID to delete it even if you’ve never used your real name.

I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're actually arguing in good faith and there's nothing sketchy about you positing on Reddit after 4 years from your last post on a post that isn't even on the front page.
---
&gt;  so the central government will not allow the separatists to be nominated as the chief executive.
---
There we have it, an open admission that the central government of the PRC will not allow people they deem undesirable to be nominated, regardless of the votes?
---
I'm not surprised, Qiao Xiaoyang actually did declare that Beijing would refuse to appoint an Hong Kong CE  that they didn't favour even if democratically elected.
---
That is definitely not universal suffrage as espoused by Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45.
---
&gt;  The ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures.[1]
---
Yep, expecting a large drop in attendance rate compared to previous years but obviously blizzard knows this and they are prepared to take these losses. I just hope things won't get too violent to the extent where the police is involved and people get hurt when the protests happen.
---
Ummm... Like with your mind...? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Time will give the answer : )
---
But if you get hacked then any random could just delete the account ,which has happend before. ID just proves that you are the owner if you think they just want it to give to China then I dont know what to tell you...
---
Piss off, ghost.
---
Yes and no.
---
Yes, Blizzard would still have to eat the server costs free-to-play players incur.
---
No because the game is still collecting data that can be sold later on and free-to-play players still act as content for the paying playerbase.
---
&gt; By the same logic, the community thinks that Blizzard is being the asshole and showing them the door.
---
Not really, since "the community" is not really in the necessary position of power to make that call in a decisive manner.
---
Still illegal in the EU.
---
Wait..Blizzcon is in less than a month, and they still pulled this shit?
---
I forsee a massacre during the Q/A panel.
---
!remindme 362 days
---
To remember this blizzard shit in a year
---
I'm down for this. Wish it had more traction
---
I know, they are still banning a majority tho.  
---
[https://imgur.com/XvCIPZD](https://imgur.com/XvCIPZD)  
---
thats my ban. Answered a guy who said blizzard protects their employees by banning the guys.
---
Pretty much only the Chinese need to be brought into the fold.
---
Mainland Chinese employees have apologized to China. Employees of the main Blizzard company have been silent.
---
Honestly, war analysts have been saying for years that we're in a new world war - it's just digital/cultural.  After all this, I believe them.  China wages *serious* cyber bullying, attacks, and propaganda, and they are working to undermine our own culture and value systems.  This shit needs to be recognized on a national level and say to them that they keep this shit up we're taking military retaliation. 
---
And I hate to say it but honestly only conservative politicians have been pushing back against China.  And they're right.
---
Hey, all cool buddy. Not actually expecting it to go through.
---
Never made a purchase, only ever played free content, so don’t want them to have access to information. They very likely won’t care if my account is deleted.
---
I understand why the iD verification is there, and I chose between genuinely getting my account deleted or sending through a request to boost deletion request numbers. 
---
I’m not comfortable sending a pic of my iD, but I can send the request anyway.
---
Small actions
---
&gt; I wish the brainwashed Chinese mainlanders would spend a even a fraction of time to understand what is going on. The CCP is painting the protesters as a bunch of violent separatist rebels.
---
How much can they actually do that though what with the heavy censorship?
---
re: account deletion, atleast from their own information, Blizzard says that an account deletion will result in any personally information being either deleted or anonymized and unrecoverable once executed
---
&gt; My last post about my opinion has been deleted by Reddit.
---
Did you also fail to flair that one?
---
I use the vanilla website and there does not seem to be an option to copy the message with formatting intact
---
Because people will keep asking him what his opinion on the matter is until he answers. I think it's a very valid answer as we shouldn't expect people to just give up their livelihood if they've worked so hard for it.
---
Blizzard will never live this down, Blizz-con next year is going to be either riots or a ghost town, RIP Blizzard. You alienated your largest fans
---
China already has your ID. Same for US, just don't go there.
---
angrilly commenting and posting won't save hong kong.
---
I hope whatever reward you're getting from the government for spreading propaganda is worth it.  Did you even write your original post or copy paste it from some government bulletin?
---
I'm too old to know what anyone likes anymore. I just assume we hate everything.
---
To be fair, the Chavez era was completely different than the current one. While it's a lot more complicated than I could say in a couple sentences, supporting Chavez ten years or more ago, when Venezuela was swimming with oil money, was reasonable.
---
The Amazon rainforest burning? What, since when?
---
... Really?
---
This is what needs to happen If you are really passionate about making Blizzard accountable.  
---
If you really want change, if this is something you \*really\* are passionate about it then get out your Reddit safety bubble.   
---
Can't go? Not in the US? do something else, stage WOW protests, do something (legal) that's going to  disrupt their business, make them work for their reformation.  
---
Deleting your accounts and boycotting is some nice symbolic acts, however Blizzard does not care about your opinions or views so long as it doesn't affect them too much and I'm sorry to say but a boycott alone just isn't good enough.  
---
This is your choice now, are you willing to put in the effort to go make a stand? or are you comfortable with the little amount you've done already?
---
No way. How come they didn't ban you? Wow.
---
FF XIV is the best variant, because it was made in Japan, and China can't stand the japanese.

Quitting Hearthstone?

Gods Unchained is a new competitive TCG led by the former Director of Magic the Gathering: Arena. The cards are real world tradable in an open economy, remember their stats and history, and you'll be able to play for keeps and earn valuable cards(Highest price for a sold card so far was $62,000).
---
Gods Unchained is free to play and currently in beta but invite-only so if you're interested you can use my invite code: https://godsunchained.com?beta-key=SCvlcDrifK
---
Yes but you can't stand against the encroachment of Chinas mass censorship by doing so.
---
You can set the portrait for specific decks. Could you just need to update that?
---
Oh, that's not ok. Thanks for sharing!
---
Well if you really want my opinion on a hypothetical that involves a whole lot of ifs...
---
It would depend on the nature of the "slam"; was it more "Trump's policies are problematic" or more "Fuck Trump and Nazi retards"? Context matters.
---
But here are some things that suggest your hypothetical isn't equivalent with this situation:
---
1. "At the same time, we will, as always, resolutely safeguard national dignity."
---
2. Why were the casters also fired?
---
3. I can literally make a WoW character named Trumplol right now, but FreeHongKong is not permitted. How can the former be sufficiently apolitical but the latter too offensive? We already know the answer.
---
When this blows over many people will regret this
---
The first goes to Hong Kong Free Press, the second goes straight to a group of volunteer medics who are in constant need of supplies. They send pictures of their receipts for first aid and other supplies to show you what your donation is spent on if you request it.
---
&gt; "Allahu akbar"
---
Yes, because declaring that Hong Kong should be liberated is the equivalent to that.
---
Nothing. Which is why they can wave around their clean hands and say "Hey, for once we're not the fuck-ups!".
---
Big up for the Mods. Respect!
---
For your information, yes I am. Technically I am Canadian-Chinese, but I do live in Asia right now and can understand Chinese just fine. I’ve also previously did contacted work on streaming broadcasts, not unlike the kind we’re talking about. 
---
So safe to say, I’m pretty sure I know what I’m talking about.  The question is *do you?*
---
Same. From what I've seen around the discord they seem to be working to make getting into the game easier for new players
---
Yes, that is what they are saying.
---
They could have just not done anything. I imagine that would have been the correct thing to do. Not to draw more attention to it. Maybe remove that small chunk from the VOD for the Chinese audience, but otherwise do nothing, especially not talking about it.
---
Considering the way they choose to enforce their rules is so arbitrary to begin with, they could just choose not to enforce it this time.
---
Epic with an even larger chunk owned by China claims they wouldn't do the same thing, so that seems to indicate that this was Blizzard going way too far to appease the Chinese than they would even be commanded.
---
Fuck china. china is asshole. Free Hong Kong. Free Taiwan!
---
And what was the end result of that super vague and totally legit policy?
---
Also, I never said you were Blizzard, just that you're making excuses for them.
---
I dont give a shit already.
---
&gt; servers for iCloud in China
---
Which is same if you know anything about China.
---
It started at like 4.5 before this controversy blew up. That is a huge drop for a game that is over 5 years old.
---
&gt;Free karma for me!
---
Wow, you care an awful lot about fake internet points that mean literally nothing.
---
You seriously dont understand that a game developer has no influence on china?
---
The choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind, happiness is better.
---
I don’t have him sadly but his effect seems so cool from a programming stand point. I’ll definitely look out to getting him whenever I get enough blue essence. He’s a classless card I’m pretty sure so I could just throw him into a lot of decks and hope that I draw any duplicates.
---
brilliant!!
---
The same reason why SMS still exist I guess
---
This isn't even an argument.  
---
Are you saying that anyone who owns a product that was made in China does not support human rights?  
---
Is that your admission that you don't give a fuck about human rights?  
---
Does that mean you'll be all well and happy if China started taking your organs?  
---
Honestly, re-think every aspect of your life, please.
---
If we just stop kicking the Hornets nest they'll eventually settle down, itll just take some time :)
---
Excuse my ignorance, but isn't it better to just outright discard Blizzard as a company. Don't support them in any way whatsoever, don't go to their cons, don't watch their videos, unfollow them on social media, or better yet block them. Just let it be known that you don't want to be associated with this company in any way shape or form?
---
Isn't it better to just have an empty blizzcon? Where only press is there?
---
So do you agree the Hong Kong is part of China or it should independent from it? On the surface, they are only protesting that there is no freedom of speech, but they want to make Hong Kong independent from China.
---
Just give 1 star for saying the game uses exploitive gatcha mechanics. That is legit criticism.
---
ScreenCaptor, my homie.
---
This is what's called a 'false dichotomy', a type of fallacy. The poster proposes that there are only two possible outcomes: That you ONLY care about the Blizzard/Hong Kong controversy, or that you HAVE to care about ALL controversies.
---
Humans have limited mental bandwidth, hours in the day, etc. - and caring about one cause will ALWAYS come at the expense of another cause. The time/energy/money you spend fighting this issue is time/money/energy you couldn't have spent on animal welfare, or sex trafficking, or any number of other causes.
---
Attempting to reduce the value of caring about one cause by claiming someone doesn't care about another cause is harmful to ALL causes.
---
It’s vile, like you, CCP shill.
---
That's a risk I'm willing to take
---
Totally agree. Eternal is awesome!
---
1.000 wins anduin is bugged. 
---
it disappears and switched back to normal anduin after i drag him to my deck. it doesnt work on PC and also IOS. 
---
i can't use him.
---
As a Venezuelan let me tell you that the Chavez era is what lead Venezuela to the garbage pile it is right now, with oil money soaring high all he did was spend it away like a stupid redneck who won lottery money, sure, a few people "came out" of poverty but at what cost? they basically dilapidated their future for short gains "right now".
---
It's basically what happens when you use state money to buy conscience and votes then the money runs out and you are basically back to square one or even worst. On top of that you have corruption and drug money floating around and you are left with a country with no laws, no state and drug lords as presidents.
---
It's free dust?

Maybe legal answer is the wrong phrasing. Systemic answer? Obviously Blizzard doesn't want to lose the Western market but it's certainly not guaranteed that even a boycott at that high level would be worth giving up the emerging markets. And as you notice, there are many reasons a boycott would be very unlikely to hit that level. 
---
Boycotts can bring awareness to the issue, but it will never do enough damage to affect change. It's like recycling at home to prevent Climate change. Certainly good, and will bring awareness, but even if everyone did it you're still not fixing the climate. 
---
Your correct in noting there is no legal basis to punish a company that limits the speech of it's employees/consumers/participants. Freedom of speech protects your speech from the government, not from other citizens. And legally we treat businesses as citizens, not as part of the government. 
---
In China many businesses are owned by the government. So if a TV network decides not to air your show because of a tweet that's a reprisal by the government (and under US law would be a 1st Amendment violation) In the US if a TV network decides not to air your show because of a tweet that's their right as a private citizen. 
---
If we want to hold the Chinese government businesses, and other business that operate in China, to the same values as the US government then maybe we should also make those values apply to US businesses. US businesses don't often censor speech because they follow one rule, obey the dollar. 
---
So yes, there is no law that lets us take legal action against Blizzard for censoring a tournament participant. ***But maybe there should be***
---
Because that's what heros do
---
Conservative politicians in the US have not taken even in the tinyest or steps to close the migrant camps at the border.  It’s hard to say that conservatives are more interested in human rights than in undermining china.

That's a link to the tournament rules for the Collegiate Championship.  Please feel free to read them all and note rule 7.1 subsection 1.A and how closely it resembles the rule used by Blizzard to ban Blitzchung.

Oh, have you lived there? It's not the dystopia that the United States is.

I’ll look up the hunter and priest decks then, thanks!

Does it look like we are living in a dictatorship, no?

I fired it up this morning and all was fine again. Not a clue what was going on :/

I won't.

Sure that greedy sleeping manlett dosnt have balls!  The China sweet sweet mulan is to much !

Im saving this for later!

Just cancelled my wow sub and requested a full refund.

Chill out man

Another shill.

This whole thread is headache inducing because clearly morality doesn't hold a place in society anymore.

&gt; How misinformed you are...how about look into what your protesting before you spout off utter bollocks.

What are you getting at? This reads like one of those anti-vax "I've done my research" posts

Ben chode
---
Lol and they think all of the West is hypocritical and selective in who they criticize so I guess you guys are in agreement! Aka don't play the game, no one cares
---
I’ll keep playing Hearthstone thanks thou
---
Its a known bug, you have to set him as a favorite AND use a deck where you haven't selected a hero already.
---
It will probably be fixed with the next patch is my guess since its a big issue.
---
lol bye
---
Jesus christ at least you can make your accounts look convincing if you want to post bullshit.
---
More like fuck Blizzard in the territory it's trying to court.
---
&gt;Not everything from China at all times is bad
---
Bro did you read the article I posted about how they've been killing Muslims? What are you even talking about? You're trying to justify calling people out over continuing to play a video game in spite of a companies piss poor handling of a completely different matter happening in China, and you are defending your ridiculously silly and short-sighted view by saying *China isn't bad all the time and just here?* Well, they are ***currently engaging in the genocide of their enthic-Muslim population.*** There are people who have gone in front of the UN to suggest that these people are having their ***organs harvested!*** Are you so fucking dense that you can't see why your argument is fucking ridiculous?
---
The issue here is *you* are the one who wants to be considered virtuous. *You* are the one who wants to be given a pat on the back. You might care about what's happening in HK, just as most of us do, but you don't give a shit enough to educate yourself on the subject of China and what it's currently doing in the world.
---
If you were willing to give up everything China related because of the bigger picture, not just HK, I would commend you. But you literally just tried to defend China as a whole in an attempt to focus in on the one thing you are willing to give up in a vague, pathetic attempt at coming off virtuous while shitting on others who either don't feel the same, or understand the bigger scope.
---
Fuck you, man.
---
I just read an interesting idea to make Blizzard REALLY uncomfortable: if another player in the tournament pulled off a stunt like Blitzchung but in reverse (saying something on favour of China) Blizzard can either do nothing and make everything worse or punish him as well and anger China.
---
Thank you! 1st time I've ever gotten an award I think. Made my day 😊
---
Don't buy their games, don't play their games, don't talk about their games, delete your accounts. Encourage others to do the same.
---
first words out of j.  allen his mouth at opening speech of blizcon should be free hong kong or he should be boo-d off the stage, period
---
The other major thing aside from Blizzard already taking a stance, is the world is now watching.  This is trending, politicians are speaking out about it, and if Blizzard gets majorly burned, it sends a major message of what you should and should not be doing.  Companies are also watching and hoping that things go in their favor, don't let it.
---
I really don't get why everything that makes Blizzard money is automatically therefore the morally right thing for them to do.
---
Also it's not about a "fuck China" message. It's about Blizzard cracking down on a pro democracy activist. Not a good look.
---
The top comment in this thread is currently
---
&gt; Your argument is filled with false equivalencies and whataboutery. That's gonna be a no from me, dawg.
---
When I asked him if he could point out *why* he thinks they're false equivalencies, I got 0 replies and 4 downvotes. 
---
So all that minimum of 4 people down voting me all read that I was asking for an actual counter argument instead of making your main argument "you're wrong", didn't bother replying but did down vote the comment.
---
How is asking for someone to give you more details 'stupid'?
---
By u saying  "This whole ID process is to protect your account and its contents when other forms of verification like passwords and secret questions have failed."
---
Exactly ID verif should be subsidiary to other means of verification .. BUT IT IS NOT they ask it from the first try
---
So I heard that they fired two casters and  player but what more happend?
---
It's funny how these people are losing their shit over China and then shrugging their shoulders when unarmed people are killed by agents of the state in the US over minor transgressions.
---
China won't give a fuck about Blizzard, and that's exactly the point that has to be made to American's corporations who decide to expand oversea. Make them think twice about the risk of bowing to countries who abuse their right and position.
---
This fight is so much larger than just Blizzard. Circumstance just made it so that the NBA and Blizzard were the first target, and because of that, Heartstone community is one of the first who had to take actions.
---
Absolutely
---
I'm not boycotting Disney, I'm just going to download all the movies and not pay to see them. Thats right guys, piracy is the answer! Also going to pirate all the new shows they making!
---
I've already forgotten and it's been what.. a day?
---
It's like weyland yutani selling out hadleys hope to the aliens for a percentage.
---
And yes I did just compare the Chinese establishment to xenomorphs.
---
Rings a bell: a Venezuelan here, too.
---
It is awesome to see people active for a good cause, nothing like times of arrows,bows &amp; spears... and yet, something good can come out of all this boycott.
---
Saludos
---
Thank you very much, l was wondering what else I could do. I sent the letter to my Congress rep.
---
Doesn't it irritate you to know you will never get that notification? Because it's fucking making me uneasy, why the fuck did you do this?
---
Reno.... I mean Blizzard is totally in it for money.
---
 The girl that was "censored" in the PMG report just made a video talking about the situation, this might give a bit more context [https://youtu.be/sZWUH-0doZI](https://youtu.be/sZWUH-0doZI)
---
Lol you literally have zero clue what prompted this discussion. 
---
The comment I replied to said “and the month to day return on the stock is positive” or something along those lines. To which I replied the reason why. People quitting HS doesn’t affect a stock over night and it surely wouldn’t make the month to day chart look bad. 
---
Clearly I think the company will get hit in the long run, why else would I mention I sold my stock? 
---
It’s easy being angry...hard to think.

Apple is deleting negative reviews that have Hong Kong as the reason. [https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfyt6v/apple\_is\_deleting\_reviews\_on\_blizzard\_apps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfyt6v/apple_is_deleting_reviews_on_blizzard_apps/)
---
If that gets accomplished, the result will be an even greater divide between mainland China and the rest of the world, because foreign companies will be way more reluctant to step into their market.
---
That is going to isolate the Chinese people even more from the rest of the world, so I am not sure how that will make China respect human rights more.
---
a ticket is not a service or product. It can be redeemed for services and products.
---
Unsurprised I am being silenced with down-votes for voicing my opinion in this crowd.
---
There are people who use the site, and then there are accounts that camp threads that aren't even on the front page and stay there and aren't even verified.
---
You've been a Reddit for 11 minutes and you commented here. Not on any of the major subreddits or major threads. Just here.
---
This, this is what I'm have a hard time giving up. If this was some dumb left wing or right wing flexing then sure I wouldn't gi_e two shits about. Bigger then anything this is a human rights issue.
---
Please do some reason on the matter as hong kong is pleading for the US to stand for their right as they share american values. 
---
Here is my conflictions as this is what blizzard has to do. China has grown so powerful that they aren't "forcing" companies to do anything, but they won't have access to the china's markets if they do follow china's ruling. I love the game and supprteall the content creators, but watching any blizzard related content just didn't sit right. I couldn't sit in any chat and pretent that "oh, that is politicals and I don't want to address it". which I combletely gete they went to hearthstone related content for entertianment, not to be in the cross hairs of a geo political situation. 
---
So I've played a few dailies, but it didn't sit right with me and I guess I'm upset that many people of this hearthstone community is just treating this as noise getting in the way of just wanting to play a game. There rs nothing wrong with contiuing to play this game as it is your own freedom. But I just ask for some empathy and not trying to undermind people's outrage as it get's in the way of yoor game.
---
Oh, sorry for the trouble. Also, thank you and all the other mods for the great work you've done :)
---
The Mulan controversy is different.
---
She is an actress who voiced her support of China. You may disagree with her, but she is allowed that speech, and you're obviously allowed to not watch her movie. But hey, that's literally what free speech is about. Also she doesn't represent the views of Disney or her fellow cast-mates (but yes you can make the argument that Disney also sucks the teet of china).
---
Blizzard SEVERELY reprimanded a player and 2 casters for exercising that same free speech. Regardless of how you feel about Hong Kong, EVERYONE should be alarmed that an American company is bowing down to Chinese censorship. This is a MUCH bigger deal than the Mulan controversy. 
---
And I'm saying this as a Chinese American with family in China with very pro-China views.
---
I wonder who it could have been
---
#      HMMMM IF ONLY I COULD THINK OF SOMEONE WHO WOULD DO SUCH A THING
---
Nope I got nothin.
---
Inb4 everybody forgot in 2 weeks
---
It won't happen because political inserters are but a vocal minority. Most people who go on Blizzcon go there for games, not for politics.
---
I mostly agree.  A quick statement didn't have to be an apology, but it could have been deescalation.  I hate it, but their current approach of saying nothing and letting the fire die out isn't an unreasonable decision on their part.  It seems to me that they're simply going to let this fire flicker out on its own.  I actually uninstalled HS a week before this all went down (mainly because I hadn't played in a while, but kept buying the pre-purchase expansion stuff thinking I would). However I play a lot of Overwatch with their new 2-2-2 system, and it's been tough for me to not play it b/c I was really enjoying it.  I was hoping Blizzard would retract their firing of the casters, and remove the ban on Blitzchung (aka reduce it all to just a fine), but at this point it doesn't look like that will happen.
---
yep
---
They probably would have been punished, but definitely not as severly.  The casters certainly wouldn't have been fired for life.
---
Just X-posted it :) Have a nice day!
---
This is...actually a normal dip. Which means congrats, you've managed to do absolutely nothing.
---
Fuck you, blizzard. 
---
Fuck you, Chinese government.
---
No... Just no.
---
Just wait a few days until the next big outrage comes along so the cancel culture can move on. There is no point in arguing with the outraged mob because outrage is the lifeblood of these people. They crave for it.
---
Yeah, but sadly people lap it right up. 
---
I remember getting downvoted and argued with to hell and back because I stated I couldn't stand the recent trend of companies pandering to the LGBT and feminist agenda because "muh representation ish important!"
---
What they don't realize though is that those companies aren't representing you. They're turning you into a circus act for their own profit. And the moment your act stops being entertaining, they'll throw you under the bus. 
---
If they truly cared, they would include you without all the fanfare and instead treat you just like they would treat any straight, white male. The goal of feminism and the LGBTQ movement isn't to be acknowledged as better or superior, but as equal. All we want is to be given the same rights and respect any straight, white middle class man can expect.
---
He wasn't willing to risk his 5 year old acc, and so made a 0 risk account
---
Look at that, you were right! Thanks for believing in me u/Yupleandrit0
---
Bottom line is the player and casters were punished for their breaking of clear cut GM rules and unprofessionalism. They did NOT get punished for what they believe.  Believe it or not, when you work for a big public company you have to follow their rules and be a professional. I know that concept is impossible to grasp for 90% of this sub.
---
Ah yes, make life harder for the people not involved in the decision at all, that'll show 'em!
---
He's Taiwanese, so I assume he lives there as well. Correct me if I'm wrong though.
---
Much like I understand your point of view. But that's the idea of having property to begin with, once you own it, it's yours to do with what you want. The whole situation sucks and priorities have to be taken, and I think most folks are putting human decency above software licenses and games... 
---
As a gamer for almost 30 years now, it's hard to choose that nostalgia over anything else, but there are lines. People have been trampled, shot, marked by hostile governments, harassed... it's just not how things are supposed to be, and one thing I always loved about the video game hobby was the power to unite under good designs, narratives, artistic visions... just the whole medium.
---
Good guy mod team! You guys are great!
---
what's his twitch channel? would like to donate to him.
---
It'll never be lifted btw, I got perma banned for discussing Nostalrius when it got shut down and blizzard denied every appeal I've made, I gave up.
---
I don’t know if the number checks out considering the absurd population of China but assuming it does:

If you don’t appease the 15% you will not sell a single copy of your games there because it’s not going to get approved by the Chinese government. 
---
How many people of the 85% who disapprove of this will actually alter their spending decisions due to this? Will 13 year old Jack not wish CoD for Christmas anymore? Will his parents have a clue who Blizzard is, that this incident happened, that they’re owned by Activision and that deny their sons Christmas wish because of it?
---
Will Alex who played WoW for 15 years cancel his subscription because of this?
---
Will Jessie who is a teacher only sometimes plays Hearthstone on her commute even know about this? Did this even reach mainstream media?
---
Will anyone remember this when Diablo 4 hits the App Store in 2 years?
---
You don’t lose 85% of your player base. You rub 15% the wrong way. The rest don’t know or don’t care. 90% of those 15% will have forgotten about it a year down the road.
---
All numbers pulled out of my ass of course but ask a friend of yours who isn’t on Reddit if he heard about this. Ask him if he isn’t going to play Candy Crush anymore because of this. Did you even know Candy Crush is owned by Activision? China does.
---
Seeing not stepping forward with an opinion as having a negative opinion makes you the lost cause.
---
How can you rightfully say what one person thinks if they literally never said anything about the topic?
---
(This is not to say that Blizzard has never said anything about the situation, this is simply to illustrate that it is odd to think that saying nothing means saying the wrong thing.)
---
LMFAO so funny.
---
I wrote my senator last night about the situation asking her to publicly comment on the situation.
---
Legally no, it is their right as a business to do so. However by doing so, they've shed like on the bigger issue, how china's censorship is encrouching onethe rights of those outside of china.
---
They will do nothing, they already released reasoning why they banned him. Some ppl will protest, some will not care and life will go on.
---
Seconded
---
Fuck you
---
Maybe it's not a big deal to you but if people are risking their lives to protest like you said then it must be because something is very wrong
---
Just spam them with account deletion requests with the HK flag as your ID ;)
---
It's not weird. Why are you trying to downplay this movement anyway? If Reddit decides to support a movement, why not encourage it? People are hypocrites in a lot of ways. People aren't able to dedicate their entire life to fighting all the atrocities in the world. So fucking what? Something good is going on right now at least.
---
No you dimwit, the issue I’m talking about is the fucking rage boner on this subreddit. You can’t even comprehend a simple sentence like that and u have the audacity to say that I have bad English? 
---
And you also assumed that I’m from China, nice.
---
English is my main language you idiot.
---
I guess you did not consider that this post is relevant for English searches. Europeans might Google the same thing in their own language. For example: https://trends.google.de/trends/explore?date=now%207-d&amp;q=Blizzard%20l%C3%B6schen
---
We care as much as you.
---
Its 2019 how low IQ can you be to actually believe this?. Also it's their legal duty to provide systems to cancel your account.
---
Can always count on reddit getting anal about someone taking a picture of a screen
---
Ya you are right. There are a lot of shitty governments. Chinese is just the most powerful one that's affecting us.
---
Cavity searches.
---
I am a hongkonger. You choose what you disregard is the violent of the police force out of control and the government ignore the public opinion. Peace is important but the freedom from fear is more important. Let me ask you a question. The crime of citizens will be arrested by police force, who will arrest the crime of police force?
---
100% **this.**
---
can we not bring politics into blizzcon?
---
the thing many people travel all over the world to celebrate being with friends?
---
can we just not do that?
---
Or just an anti USA slogan... These same folks would have burned down blizzard hq if they didn't get a ban and winnings taken away. The USA people I mean obviously
---
as usual, lack of unionisation is the problem
---
You see, the basis is one country. By electing a separatist into that position defeats the very foundation of this very unique system. The joint declaration and the basic law were negotiated and drafted on the basis of one country, so Beijing reserves the right of final interpretation.
---
If that was the goal then its a pretty late one given the amount of Chinese investment. You're only pretending to be mad about this because the guy proclaimed the right opinion - if it wasn't I absolutely guarantee you would all be supporting Blizzards decision.
---
It'd be more helpful to refresh your face. Gagging double gagging Blizzard's and China's cock like that must have you in tears.
---
Alright, cool. Thanks for the advice. I'll definitely consider it.
---
Yes, he insults you, but he doesn't ban you or put you in jail.
---
Try going outside in Shenzhen and holding up a sign that says "Down with the CCP".  See how many hours you last before getting arrested.
---
In free countries you can express yourself freely and consume whatever information you want.  For example, I don't like President Trump, so I could freely go outside the White House with a sign saying "Fuck Trump".  I can go online and read hundreds and thousands of articles and sources that are extremely critical of the government.
---
You can't do that in China.  This is the freedom we're protesting for.  If someone supports China, they should be able to say that, as you're doing now, with freedom.  If someone supports Hong Kong, they should be able to say that with freedom.
---
Otherwise we'll end up in a society like the society run by the CCP where people can only see the information that the CCP wants them to see, and they can only say the things that the CCP wants them to say.
---
It's easy for the CCP to say "we want unity" when really they mean "we want everyone to only see and say the things that we want them to see and say".
---
The politics of Hong Kong and the actions of the rioters are completely irrelevant.  Precisely because it's complicated, both sides should be free to express themselves and show their information to the world.
---
The Weibo statement was Netease? The Chinese company that handles Hearthstone in China.  It wasn't Blizzard saying that.  I believe blizzard should drop them for adding more gas to the fire.
---
It's such a hilarious thought to me that a card game can be "broken" based on software mechanics... Then again I have never played any of these digital card games that don't have a real-life tabletop counterpart.
---
Which is why the US lost the Vietnam War, because the farmers were better equipped than the most powerful military superpower?
---
No, not those.
---
I've deleted my membership and they won't be getting any more of my money.  I've spent over $1000 on [battle.net](https://battle.net) so while I'm not a mega whale I'd say I'd spend more than the average person.
---
Most of these companies are just getting their pinky toes in the Chinese market though, the potential there vastly outnumbers the Western market. China has almost double the people of EU + US combined..
---
If Blizzards financial reports show an increase in China in decrease in NA I'm pretty sure they're delighted.
---
Globally operating companies would financially handicap themselves to operate in a way that bars them entry from the Chinese market. Governments need to enact pressure for their human right violations, but seems it's all come down to consumers
---
Btw, I'm not at all defending Blizzard in this situation, fuck em.
---
You leave out the part where in the rules, it states "To blizzard's discretion". Meaning they looked at it and decided that support for hong kong would sour their name. The vast majority supports hong kong, so the only people it would sour blizzards name with is their Chinese sugar daddy.
---
Artifact? lol, isn't it dead?
---
But tell me more about that GTA:SA thing, this sounds interesting!
---
\+44 is the UK, so I would assume EU
---
We can‘t bring a war against everyone under the violation of PRC,although the "engagement"strategy started by George Bush after tian'anmen incident have been proven failed and abused by Machiavellists like Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin.
---
It's hard to explain everything about east asia history in a few words,but I will say,“中国”(zhongguo),which means "Country in the center of the world",is kinds of like "the lord of the rings".So long as the One Ring suppresses East Asia,Asians like us would never grant freedom and happiness.
---
Even when countries like Japan,Korea and Vietnam are discussed,it's true.We all know the history of Imperial Japan.They consider themselves as the center of the world or at least of east asia.
---
It is very true. I go to a UC with many Chinese students and most of them don't really believe that Hong Kong protests are real, just a media farce.
---
It is real, I dont know if it is relevant or not but 1. This is chinese twitter, so ofc they will openly support china, and 2. This was before the news blew up and everyone became outraged
---
That was great.
---
Trying to defend the pride and dignity of China can be interpreted in a myriad of different ways, and it is about as neutral of a phrase as can be used on the *Chinese-owned* Weibo that won't add fuel to the fire on that side of the globe.
---
This aggression will not stand, man. FREE HONG KONG!
---
Well, again, let’s go over this a bit. Kripp hasn’t played competitive hearthstone in years. He doesn’t cast, he’s just not on Blizzard’s payroll. He gets invited to events and gets card reveals because he’s a massive personality, but he’s not financially beholden to Blizzard. 
---
Thijs and the other GMs are. We can delete our accounts in protest, and that is a valid sacrifice. But ask yourself, would you quit your job? Some people may be willing to do so, but most aren’t. I don’t blame them for being cautious with how they approach the situation, because, again, their livelihood is entirely tied to Blizzard. Now, I don’t know what Thijs said, all I know is he’s been banning people in his chat who want to discuss it. That’s a shit move, but it’s his channel so if he wants to ban people, you can boycott his too. That’s the extent of what we should do. Don’t harass him. Freedom of speech goes both ways.. He’s entitled to his views, but you can also just not support him. Hit his wallet, just like we’re hitting Blizzard’s.
---
Sure I agree, what I don’t get is how they decide who will control them. “We need to be controlled... hey those communist party guys over there look cool in their good suits, let’s make them the overlords!” Don’t see the logic.
---
Also Taiwan is by all accounts a functioning society so the idea of “only the CCP could do the job” doesn’t hold up.
---
Moderators suck, if you truely care you should remove this subreddit as a whole.  
---
This subreddit stands for human organs harvesting and anti human rights.
---
I feel like this is the wrong decision, I bet they’re gonna be so pissed that someone deleted their account and will rebuy everything once they say sorry.
---
30 snip snaps in wild? he sure the guy didn't have a mechwarper on the board?
---
No?
---
Oooowww snowflake are you outraged about the outrage?
---
Leave Jeff alone, ok? He's had a rough week.
---
What does YouTube have to do with this
---
these people are dumb, Blizzard cant please everybody. If Blizzard cant maintain a healthy relationship with Chinas officials then their servers to china will be cut off and everyone in china will be blocked from playing any blizzard games in general. chinas residents need to fix their shit in their country if they want the backing from companies like blizzard.
---
holy fucking shit youre barking up the wrong tree
---
wasnt saying anything about fox viewers, was definitely talking about how fox views and treats their viewers. fuck off
---
Blizzard literally shaking with rage rn
---
Technology just isn't there yet
---
Thank you for your service. FREE HONG KONG!
---
Ooooh a REAL job. Please do tell what is a real job? Painter? Writer? Singer?
---
Probably won't get one until monday, Blizzard is notoriously slow with... everything.
---
Yea it isn’t that easy.  You’re only thinking of one side of the shitstorm, the western one.  The other side of the shitstorm is the Chinese government.  They needed a response to appease both sides.  Maybe their response was too harsh... or maybe there are specific threats China was ready to follow through on without a harsh enough response.
---
Yes  it's not in the top post of this week, I had to search on google images "Blizzard" to find it
---
Didnt the founders leave already as well? Its only the name at this point, used for brand recognition.
---
Honestly this. By blizzcon there will be like 1 protestor in an ironic cosplay.  Everyone will forget and go back to blizzard.   Sad but the truth.
---
It just looked so baity. Thanks for the confirmation.   
---
The words used are truly infuriating. Of course they don't want you to express political beliefs when it brings light to the horrors of reality that they themselves (Chinese govt.) Are directly responsible for.
---
Thats okay. My comment was rude and I apologize.
---
I can detect the thinly veiled sarcasm, but I'll bite.
---
To be as blunt as possible.  Do nothing.  Because it's not our fight.  Look, there are MANY different governments around the world that have many different levels of what we call "normal" political processes.   Those political processes only occur within those countries.  Those are the people who can \*really\* affect those processes.
---
"Spreading Awareness" on a gaming subreddit is akin to "thoughts and prayers".  It's a token gesture, meant to (as I said earlier) signal virtue by way of something easily done by people in a 1st world country with "no problems"  (quotes for emphasis there, I'll touch on that in a second)
---
Contacting your reps \*is\* the best thing to do.  But I personally don't want our reps in government to do anything, because as I mentioned.  The last two times the US attempted to interfere with Asian liberation movements, resulted in a permanent stalemate and life-long enemy (North Korea).  And the other attempt ended in countless lives lost in Vietnam, also ending in a "stalemate" (but really was more of a loss than anything considering the circumstances if you dig into non-sanitized versions of history.
---
Deleting your Blizzard account is also a token signal.  It's akin to changing your Facebook photo to a version with a flag overlay.  It's an easy move, that really doesn't change anything in the long run.  The people who posted that they did this, think that "I'm hurting them where it counts".  Do people honestly think a few hundred, even a few thousand account deletions is going to hurt blizzard?  And for what?  For blizzard to try to keep THEIR tournaments, and THEIR platform from turning into a "free" political activist platform?  Think about it from an executive standpoint:  If they did nothing, then every activist person in the future would think "I'm allowed to say/support activist/revolutionary comments without any recourse when I'm at a blizzard competitive event".   And lastly, those who deleted their accounts, MANY of them just said "Deleted account, time to play MTGA".  So are they really doing anything?  It's like cutting off your nose to spite your face.  At the end of the day, that person is still sitting around playing games,  jerking off to their reddit post about how they "deleted their blizzard account" and not actually doing ANYTHING of substance.
---
It sets a dangerous precedent for them. A gaming company should not be a platform for activism.  
---
So if you DO want to do something, contact your government officials.  (I personally don't for the reasons I mentioned above which I'll go into now.)
---
Our country is not without problems.  The US is at it's highest divide politically,  I wouldn't be surprised if the next few elections don't see our own protests/revolutions.  Our government has it's own corrupt problems, and while our society is decent overall, our government is declining.  We are also back to a high level of racial tensions (partly due to the political climate in the US) than there's been since the "race riots" of the 60's and 70's.  Lastly, I don't want the US to get into a pissing match with China.  North Korea is like the 8 year old kid who eggs your car every week, but generally isn't a threat (right now).  
---
But China and North Korea are on "ok" terms.  And China is the ONLY way we have towards any sort of future potential peace with North Korea.  However, if the government antognizes relations with China,  any sort of brokerage of peace with North Korea is off the plate.  However, pissing off China is not a good idea.

&gt;US vs. China Military Strength: Comparing Defense Capabilities  
---
&gt;

&gt;*By* [*Pritha Paul*](https://www.ibtimes.com/reporters/pritha-paul) [@ZiggyZina143](http://www.twitter.com/ZiggyZina143)

&gt;According to a report published by the Pentagon on China's military power on Thursday, Beijing’s armed forces were expanding at a fast rate, which could soon “contest U.S. military superiority." The [Congressionally-mandated report](https://media.defense.gov/2019/May/02/2002127082/-1/-1/1/2019%20CHINA%20MILITARY%20POWER%20REPORT%20(1).PDF) stated that China was trying to transform its military into a major global power by any means necessary...  
---
&gt;1. Chinese Army’s total ground force personnel stands at 1,020,000, while in 2018,[ the National Defense Authorization Act ](https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr5515/BILLS-115hr5515enr.pdf)increased the U.S. Army’s authorized end strength to 1,026,500 soldiers from 483,500.  
---
&gt;2. While China has only a single operational aircraft carrier, the U.S. military has 11. According to the [South China Morning Post,](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2185081/china-will-build-4-nuclear-aircraft-carriers-drive-catch-us-navy) China plans to have at least six aircraft carriers by 2035, four of which will be nuclear-powered.  
---
&gt;3. China has 5,800 tanks, while the U.S. has 6,287 combat tanks, [according to Global Fire Power](https://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=united-states-of-america).  
---
&gt;4. The U.S. Navy tops China when it comes to the number of destroyers. The former holds 68 destroyers, while the latter has just 33.  
---
&gt;5. The number of submarines the Chinese Navy has - including diesel attack, nuclear attack and ballistic missile ones - totals 70, while the U.S. Navy falls just two short.  
---
&gt;6. China has 1,500 fighter aircraft while the U.S. has 2,362 of the same jets.  
---
&gt;7. [According to Newsweek,](https://www.newsweek.com/how-many-nuclear-weapons-do-us-russia-have-heres-what-you-need-know-816879) the U.S. has 652 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), while the recent Pentagon report said China has 90.  
---
&gt;“Most of China’s missile programs, including its ballistic and cruise missile systems, are comparable in quality to other international top-tier producers. China produces a wide range of ballistic, cruise, air-to-air, and surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) for the PLA \[Public Liberation Army of China\] and for export, which has enhanced its primary assembly and solid propellant rocket motor production facilities,” the report said.  
---
&gt;China’s military spending budget for 2018 was $170.4 billion – a significant increase from a decade ago when it was under $100 billion. “China has the political will and fiscal strength to sustain a steady increase in defense spending during the next decade, which will help support PLA modernization, develop an integrated military-civilian defense industry, and explore new technologies with defense applications,” the report stated.  
---
&gt;It added: “China aims to complete military modernization by 2035 and make the PLA into a ‘world-class’ military by 2049, through both modernization as well as structural and command changes.”  
---
&gt;The DoD said that although maintaining a “constructive, results-oriented relationship with China” was an important part of their strategy to successfully maintain peace in the Indo-Pacific region, it was wary of growing diplomatic tension between the two countries and said it was prepared for all forms of aggression.  
---
&gt; “Although DoD engages with the PLA, DoD will also continue to monitor and adapt to China’s evolving military strategy, doctrine, and force development. The United States will adapt its forces, posture, investments, and operational concepts to ensure it retains the ability to defend the homeland, deter aggression, protect our allies and partners, and preserve regional peace, prosperity, and freedom,” the report said.
---
In short.  China is just a \*squeak\* behind us in pure military strength.  I don't want another war for the US.  I don't want us to be the world's police.  Let China and HK deal with the situation with their own countries/governments.  (Also I guarantee you that report isn't 100% accurate.  I doubt China would divulge any top secret information regarding the modernization of their military capacity)
---
I want people to have free speech, but it's paid for by the blood of those in those countries, not gamers sitting in arkgamer chairs making posts on social media while playing a DIFFERENT game under the guise of activism.
---
You keep saying this shit defending Blizzard and yet I didn't provide a fucking photo ID to Epic when I deleted my account with them, to a number of companies with MMOs I played for a while, or to literally fucking anyone I've deleted an account through.
---
There are a number of steps that must be gone through to delete an account. If you think a picture of a fucking photo ID, which could be easily faked by someone intent on fucking with you, is the One True Way of verifying shit you're sadly goddamn mistaken.
---
Ive made the switch to magic arena. I like the game better anyway, so it wasnt that hard. Id suggest giving it a try to scratch the ccg itch. In terms of gaming videos, one streamer I watch a lot is Brownman, and he posts the VODs on youtube.
---
I know that the intelligent part doesn't apply to you. Exception makes rule
---
It's "Do you not have phones"
---
Everyone gets it wrong and uses "Don't you have" :(
---
A year or more ago I might have agreed, but it's all one big pile of shit today.
---
They have Chinese employees, and even American employees, are you telling me you think Blizzard should fuck those people out of jobs for the sake of making a statement about Hong Kong?
---
30 is not humanly possible
---
The problem being you folks are trying to extrapolate a couple questionable instances in a decentralized group to the whole group. It's pretty clear that Antifa has no authority structure yet there seems to be the prevalent strawman that the group is directed to be a bunch of thugs. It should be easy to tell something that is part of a systematic plan by a group or not yet ideas like this *still persist because of people simply moving lock-step with a malformed idea*.
---
It’s okay. My ignorance did bear some resemblance to that internet hero.
---
Already have Crash btw.
---
Old blizzard is dead... I know
---
If it's a new constitutional convention we're holding I just want jerrymandering to be amended against. That would solve so many problems.
---
How do we begin a serious analysis?  What resources or sources should we be looking at to start getting a better scope of the issue?
---
Ahh yes, getting convicted of fraud, the perfect way to get back at blizzard
---
RemindMe! 999999 Years
---
I would never demand anyone to stop playing a game they love. Everyone will have to make up their own mind of what they are willing to commit to.
---
Yes, EU
---
This is absolute gold
---
&gt; How is the use of VPNs in China? 
---
Since those popular apps that we use usually have a Chinese version/rip-off, I would say VPN is not a must, but having it would make your life easier. As VPN can be used for any kind of conversation or information outside the country, political or not, which are banned in China regardless. 
---
&gt; Why would you, for instance, believe in "news" if they are censored. 
---
CCP have appointed members for pretty much every school, no one is going to say bad thing about China and they are as well taught American is the villain as they are the two of big countries that are able to compete. I think this explains why every anti-freedom post by fellow Chinese, they would usually shift the blame on America and think they are the chosen one to uncover American evil nature.
---
Deleted my account as well - this is ridiculous
---
30 is, barely, 31+ really isnt
---
That whatever you are trying to say, wasn't said properly enough for me to understand what you are talking about.
---
Plus, the chinese shills are out in full force. But I cant say you are one, considering i have no idea what you are saying.
---
Even Reno has standards...
---
I like how you realized you can't factually argue against my comment.
---
I don’t care if tencent partially owns a company if, like fortnites ceo has said they won’t bend to China or tencents demands in censorship
---
We are too far ahead of our times
---
&gt;In on it? The guy was wearing a mask, literally everyone knew why. Casters were put in an awkward spot, if anything the production team would be the ones to pull the plug on the broadcast.
---
What do you mean by awkward spot? It didn't seem so with their giggling and body language. Did I miss something? Was it perhaps because of how the entire crew might have been in on what was about to happen and that inadvertently the casters were the ones made to take the punishment rather than everyone who might have shared some responsibility for what has happened?
---
Dude has steadily refused to reply to any real argument and just sticks to the quick quips.. it's well, interesting.
---
I got the monthly a few days before all this came about.
---
Good timing, I guess.
---
Because republicans aren't taxing the wealthy. One and only reason the American Economy is in the shit right now. The middle class are being taxed in to poverty so we can't afford to hold up the economic growth of the country while the rich just pocket all the profit and send it to their offshore banking accounts where it doesn't effect America at all.
---
The U.S. could feasibly invade any country. They probably couldn't take Beijing from the Chinese, but we could sure as shit steal all their natural resources. We could sure as shit liberate Tibet and Hong Kong. We could make life very hard for the chinese government.
---
Understand that the U.S. government has top secret weaponry and tactics that no country in the world could be prepared for. China has made a policy of revealing every single time it makes a weapon that counters the U.S. military strategy in the region. They make public the DongFeng missile which can be used to take down U.S. carriers. They publicize this information to deter an american attack.
---
Trust me, the U.S. has weapons that no one knows about and will be impossible to counter. The Chinese military strategy is completely based on how the U.S. went about the gulf war 30 plus years ago, trust me, our strategy will be far more nefarious than that.
---
U.S. vs China military comparison  [https://armedforces.eu/compare/country\_USA\_vs\_China](https://armedforces.eu/compare/country_USA_vs_China)  
---
U.S. has 20 air craft carriers. China has 2.
---
Is it true that some protestors have resorted to unwarranted violence? Yes, to deny that would be to encourage misinformation. Does that mean that these select individuals are an accurate representation of the literal millions of Hong kongers that are taking to the streets to fight for their right to vote for their own leader? Hell's no. The violent and more radical individuals are the ones that get the most attention on the media and they're the ones heard most loudly. But the majority simply want the right to chose the leader that represents them on the global stage(note, the CCP is such an oppressive shithole of a state, that the Hong Kong people don't even dare ask for separation from the bullshit "1 party, 2 system" system, something that they clearly desire in the long term)
---
Not that they would do this but they could in theory send everyone the same receipt.
---
How is it fraud. I was completely honest in my description of why I do not believe I received the product I was expecting. I was not expecting propaganda from a communist state. I received propaganda from a communist state. I want my money back. 
---
My bank is the arbitrator of whether or not my dispute is valid. I await their decision.
---
There is no fraud. Had I said I received nothing, or claimed that I received a shipment of forks instead of card packs, that would be fraud. I have misrepresented nothing.
---
Wow!! Thats fucked...
---
!remindme 1 month
---
I am aware, but the excess of the punishment is the only thing Blizzard did wrong at that point in time.
---
The speed and harshness of the punishment probably has much more to do with the personal feelings of whichever individual manager jumped the gun rather than the feelings of Blizzard as a whole.
---
Jeeze, it's been a while. Uhhhh, Kripp had some beef with the lead director of Diablo 3, Jay Wilson, in general. A lot of it came from him mentioning a duping exploit for D3 on stream. This is when it had a real-money auctionhouse, which obviously made it a serious problem. They banned him for something along the lines of "advertising/promoting exploits", although he never explicitly discussed how to do it or confirmed that he had ever done it, simply that he knows for a fact that one exists.
---
Kripp then makes videos talking about his experience with the Diablo 3 team, and how they've basically been harassing him in pretty unprofessional ways (particularly Bashiok and Jay). Both sides were pretty snide about everything they said about the other.
---
Jay Wilson made a tweet a long time ago that whoever is the first person to clear Diablo on HC Inferno mode (which was excessively difficult at the time) would get a hug from him. Kripp and Krippi are the first ones (although people complain that it was due to the Hydra healing bug), kind of smugly say "so wheres that hug?".
---
Anyways, a lot of petty shit that Kripp probably cringes at looking back. Pretty sure he deleted all of those videos too.
---
"Someone from Blizzard HQ told them"
---
Well, it's either that, or the rules he knew of and violated.
---
It's not?
---

Someone spoke out in support of Hong Kong at the end of a grandmaster game, and Blizzard cut the stream, revoked his prize money, banned him from the game for a year and fired the casters before publicly apologizing to China for the incident.

I’m glad we both agree you have little reading comprehension

Hi guys,

new to reddit, joined in light of recent events to shit all over Bl\*zzard.   
---
They would love people to think they are too small to influence.   
---
But a consistent rain will turn into a flood. I will cancel my China account

You know what country is obsessed with sex selling? Every country. That includes the one where Blizzard is from. If they were that prudish, they wouldn't have had that art in the game in the first place.
---
No.... it's not a rare moment.  We can do something every day.  The only thing that makes this exceptional, is that lots of people are doing something.  
---
Imagine if we were outraged about the environment or about the president, and willing to follow that up with action.

---
You’re being ridiculously hostile. And btw if you use an authentication you don’t need to provide ID.
---
If you didn’t need to provide an ID to epic which I assume you spend money in their store for games ( I’ve never used it so I don’t know). They have shitty security.
---
I think you just want to be mad at blizzard so you’re finding reasons to be when you shouldn’t need extra fuel for the giant fire they started.

Good bot.

Let's take the Olympics as a point of comparison. The Olympics are run by an international committee (corrupt AF, FWIW), Hearthstone esports of the type that took place in this particular event are hosted by a company. Awards paid by that company. Playing that company's game. 
---
One is an international forum that was created to foster goodwill and healthy competition between countries (as an alternative to war, if you believe the ancient Greek precursors), the other is a company's game and it's system for promoting competitive play.
---
So who bears of the brunt of the criticism for the 68 Black Power salute? The US, people who supported segregation...etc. The intended targets.
---
Who is being vilified in this reddit? China? or Blizzard? It would be as if the Black Power salute was targeting the Olympic committee and not segregation and other human rights violations in the US.
---
The medium and the message are not the same thing.
---
Why start with a boycott of blizzard games. Seems very inconsequential
---
If they just banned the player and not fired the casters would this have been a big issue? The player did break policy.
---
Congratulations then you're officially a awful person
---
Oh no... not MLG... whatever will we do without that?...
---
&gt;No they are not, its open to the public
---
Just because the public can buy a ticket to gain entry does not mean that it is open to the public. This is a private event, held by a private party, at a public venue. They can and more than likely will block entry and remove people and that's their prerogative. They can simply say that the people they remove are disrupting the convention or reducing the value of the experience that others have paid for and that will clearly trump the center's own Code of Conduct.

So, definitely, Spanish gamers haven't interest on deleting accounts or boycotting blizzard

Low level thinkies imo. If you want to actually make a point, you need to do more than whine across 3 paragraphs. It's the slacktavism equivalent of debate, but I fear the irony was lost on you.

An automated form being broken isn't the same thing as not allowing erasure. Their EU privacy policy provides an email to contact their DPO, who would obligated to respond in a timely manner.

Aggression? I'm asking what decks people are playing...
---
Many people say that penalizing BlitzChung in some way was absolutely warranted and I agree with them. Just look at Brian Kibler's response to the situation and you will see a prominent member of the Hearthstone community expressing that exact sentiment. I would absolutely expect that if a US player went onto an interview and said the fourteen words or another White Supremacist slogan that they would be punished. 
---
I personally am not upset that they punished BlitzChung for his actions, I am upset that the punishment was unbelievably heavy-handed and went far beyond what the situation called for in a clear attempt to make an example of BlitzChung. Taking the money he had earned up to that point is profoundly disrespectful to his contributions to the league up to that point, banning him from competing certainly didnt need to happen for simply making a statement in an interview, and firing the casters who had no reasonable way to respond differently to the situation indicates clearly that Blizzard doesn't value the work done by their casting talent. The casters were even fired from being able to cast other Blizzard games, because one of the casters was primarily an Overwatch caster and he was removed from that as well.
---
So please do not think that everyone believes BlitzChung should not have faced a penalty. Perhaps the penalty should have been removing him from the league, though I think giving him a small fine to be payed through his winnings or perhaps giving him a match or game deficit in following matches was a more fair punishment. Those are common methods of punishment in a league setting, and had they done that I think the backlash would not have been as severe as it is. The reality is that the lengths Blizzard went to in punishing BlitzChung were far greater than was warranted and clearly were intended to suck up to the CCP. 
---
I certainly still support the movement in Hong Kong and so I do support BlitzChung making the statement he did, but I also recognize it was against the rules of the league. At the moment I think people here in the West are simply excited that there is a way to start showing our support of the efforts in Hong Kong, but do not think that means everyone here is blind to the fact that BlitzChung did break the rules. Most of us think the punishment was far more heavy-handed than was necessary and are protesting that in addition to showing our support for Hong Kong.
---
&gt; you have no right to criticize people
---
Are you from Blizzard, trying to censor people too? Pretty sure I do have that right.
---
I did a run with Lazul + best friend + Magic mirror vs the second boss (the one that duplicates your first spell), and just kept casting it on the best friend  and passing until i got 20+ wolves - i think i had 27 or so wolves, however, when i started a second run to get the time above, it went down to 20 wolves - I was able to magic mirror twice during that run - with a huge 24/24 wolf I was able to kill every boss by turn 2 - last boss by turn 4.
---
Bye sheep. I hope your reddit post and ' protest ' do alot of good for the people of HK. I'll see you at the next ' protest random thing that really has nothing to do with it but lets protest something,thing '.
---
Hasty would have been within an 8 hour window. This has blown up to "international incident" levels now.

U made me
---
Wait you think China’s gonna change because hearthstone loses money? Or am I understanding you wrong?
---
Not worth responding to.
---
No shit. But if you think for a second that US is anywhere near the propaganda of the CCP, where mocking their president is worthy of god-knows-what punishments, then you seriously need to unfuck yourself.
---
Thank you for explaining the politics of my country to me. I had no idea that Dixiecrats were a thing, or that Teddy Roosevelt was a Republican that busted business trusts (though he did get campaign contributions from one of the worst businesses of the day, life insurance, which is a dirty little open secret that no one likes to remember).
---
People and priorities change. The party ideologies changed because that’s what something does, or it dies. If you stick rigidly to dogma you doom yourself, and your party. Which is what the Republicans are fast realizing, with their riding the far right freight train since good ol’ Reagan. 
---
The reason why their platforms overlap in most things, is because that’s simply what happens when a political system stabilizes, and the parties are the main proprietors of it. It isn’t some conspiracy or propaganda; that’s just the reality of what our government has become in its proto-final form. I have neither the energy nor the inclination to explain this to you, but if you actually want to know how/why that’s the case, *Government’s End: Why Washington Stopped Working*, is a great book on it, by a reputable journalist.
---
And the names of our parties are leftover from over 150 years ago and haven’t changed. Big fucking deal. They’re just associations that have lasted and haven’t needed to rename themselves.
---
Imagine claiming the USA is as bad as one of the most oppressive governments in history.  Shockingly ignorant.
---
Next time, mute/block the troll and move on. Don't waste time on that.
---
Holy shit... you really milking this thing. 
---
So sad caring so much about fake internet points.
---
I live for 2 years in the mainland, currently in South East Asia, people of mainland think their government did nothing wrong and believe HK deserve every punishment they can get and that people of HK have been brainwashed and the dog of (west, cant say it), if people of HK get prisoned or went missing, mainlander will most likely said "they deserve it".
---
i dont know why, but im even scared as i typed this, even as i post this from SEA anonymously.
---
Unlike N Korea, mainlander china love and believe their government, that HK(land) belong to china and that HK people should leave china and stay with their master (west), when in reality HK has the size of 1/100000 of china, China gov doesnt want the land, they want the HK city and HK economy, but mainlander will get angry if you talk about this.
---
As of right now, if you see twitter post of mainlander, they will say "we stand with you blizzard", "dont trust their side of story", or that they're purchasing blizzard's store item furiously to 'bribe' blizzard to not pick the "wrong" side.
---
Wtf who cares about this
---
Give the Digital Pharisees some credit. This will be all the fun for about a week before some tranny breaks a nail and the culture of outrage swings into gear to save the day.
---
About 80% of my freezes have been in-game. Frustrating.

You can't refund ur blizzcon tickets?
---
Sheesh, not this again
---
That is definately worse.
---
They are making a bet that China will be this great big market and basing it on population growth but they ignore the very real politics there that will inevitably end in violent unrest and mass murder. 
---
Try selling games in a country steeped in political unrest and pocket revolutions.  China is a long term bad investment.
---
And this sounds more like a sales pitch then anything else
---
Which is fine, as long as you don't spend your money on it.
---
Oh, absolutely. That just makes it harder for it's citizens to believe the atrocities. If the west can get swept in by local propaganda, the Chinese absolutely do.
---
\^ +1
---
I disagree. Dealing with a relatively small group of professional players isn't the same as managing employees at a McDonald's and it's a whole lot different compared to dealing the the general public. You can have a discussion with players behind the scenes about this kind of thing without banning anyone. They are professionals by title and definition and I think they should be treated that way, more than that, I think they have earned that respect. Treating them like misbehaving children is insulting on top of everything else.
---
Sure, you need some rules and someone will break a rule at some point, and then I think your idea would be the better course of action, but in this case, a thing happened, they could have addressed it behind the scenes and then gone from there. If he decides he wants to yell about this every time he's in front of a camera after being specifically told not to, okay, now something should be done. Banning for a single instance of saying something that isn't specifically banned by that exact wording gets you what we have here with this controversy today. Pulling some vaguely worded bullshit out of your ass to ban him gets you what we have here with this controversy today.
---
"Hey guys, you did [thing] this time, please don't do [thing] in the future, we won't be taking action this time about [thing], but we will have to the next time and here are the potential consequences" goes a long way.
---
Of course, that would also only work in a world without Chinese influence, and we aren't living in that world.
---
Mark Kern is worried that Diablo 4 ooooh shiny will distract everyone, I don't think he realizes just how fucking pissed off literally everyone is about this.

Hard to keep loving your job when it actively supports the removal of human rights.
---
Lots of sweeping assumptions being made about Blizzard to come to those conclusions, but it's probably for the better that you use your time more productively than addiction level gaming entails.

Neither do South East Asia. In my country (Vietnam), many of my peers thinking that deleting the account is a stupid move.

On the blizchung many say that: "Blizchung cost 2 guys their jobs, such a terrible guy".

Nobody here give a slightest damn about hongkong's plight.

I support my fellow Taiwan resident
---
(Aside from the fact that all your points have already been discussed--rules broken: granted; are the punitive measures justified? hmm...) 
---
Well if the community is wrong, Blizzard can speak out and defend itself.
---
If you pay them enough, they probably could and would. And they would even make skins about it to hide in a loot boxes.
---
They are censoring every thread on r/Blizzard right now

Fair, but no one's mad at Gods Unchained besides China. Like, no one would have a motive to bother them unless they were trying to implicate or frame China?

Then again that feels more far fetched to me.
---
&gt; The EU can't just ignore this whole thing now Blizzard are directly flouting their laws,

They're not though. The EU privacy page has contact information for Blizzard's DPO, which you can email requests to (instead of using the 'automated' process). No part of GDPR required there to be an automated process.

Jesus Christ.. has anyone seen the comments on some of those posts? Lol

I'm sick of all this whataboutism.  Make no mistake - America's committed it's fair share of atrocities (as have most countries in the West).
---
But the shit China does is on a whole different level.
---
Harvesting organs from unwilling participants, it's social credit score system, abuses of police power (which yes, also exists in America, just on a much smaller scale)

Nope. You need to get your priorities straight. An international corporation has just taken the side of the oppressor. There can be no “going elsewhere.”

By all means, continue to be a corporate shill though.

Diablo Immortal, but on a geopolitical scale and for the whole two days.

---
This is normal for blizzard recently, they will wait for the shit storm they caused to die down then give remaining players some bullshit overwatch skin or something and never really address the issue.
---
Yes of course. Blizzard is not one person. It is a company full of different beliefs and I imagine a lot share the same views as the vocal majority in this subreddit. Supporting Blizzard is not supporting China. The topic is much more nuanced than that.
---
It still would be great if you educated yourself on why this is an issue and maybe find your own way to contribute, but I leave that up to you. Plant Money did a great podcast about it:  [https://www.npr.org/2019/07/19/743480237/episode-928-hong-kong](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/19/743480237/episode-928-hong-kong).
---
Sadly there is increasingly a trend in society today I feel to classify anyone who tries to oppose your beliefs as a terrorist whether they committed acts of terror in opposing those beliefs or not. I see this often in the way people talk about Muslims in the Middle East, and I think a lot of people try to claim that all Muslims must be terrorists because they oppose Islam altogether. I do not say this to claim that we shouldn't use the term terrorist, as certainly the term has a real meaning and the actions of very many people in the world are rightfully characterized by the term terrorism, but I think that very often terrorism is used as a way to describe anybody whose opinions or beliefs are in opposition to your own. It is increasingly undermining the real and serious meaning of terrorism and worries me with how easily people try to brand anyone they disagree with as a terrorist.
---
I don’t know how to feel about that.
---
The bottom line is that Blizzard were put into an unwinnable position and whatever they did would have been wrong. Blitzchung shouldn't have bought real world politics into Hearthstone as not only was it against the rules he agreed to but it's had this effect where people online are blaming an American based software company for the way a government thousands of miles away is run. 
---
If Blizzard didn't punish Blitzchung then the floodgates are open and every gamer with a political stance now can spout off. The reason Blizzard don't allow real world politics is because of exactly scenarios like this. Hearthstone is an online digital card game and it shouldn't be used as a political platform, however just the cause may be. It's exactly the same in sports across the world. Blizzard knew full well this punishment would gather a negative response, but what other choice did they have? Rules are rules and lines have to be drawn otherwise future events will just descend into chaos. 
---
The events in Hong Kong are serious, and they do deserve global attention but boycotting Blizzard will solve absolutely nothing. People should campaign in more meaningful ways if they feel that passionately about the issues, but the sad truth is China are not going to listen to the youth of the Western world anymore than they listen to their own youth.
---
Don't forget all the good work they are doing for human rights in Hong Kong by drawing so much attention to it with their over the top behavior and for exposing the Chinese hand so far up inside Blizzard.
---
Did you switch out the wrong legally or are you trying to say that people think it isn’t morally wrong?
---
Right! This puts them in a checkmate that’s why we need to protest in MASS in front of blizzcon so we will be heard!!!

Scotland and England have different education systems. And no. They don’t talk about it in English schools because I took GCSE history and none of the courses would’ve mentioned it, and I did A Level politics and friends who did A level history. If it was going to come up it would have

When they changed my account name, I could still play with the generic name. I played for a few days with the name while waiting for a response to the ticket to try to get my name back. They didn't lock my account. Theres no need to lock it, they can literally just change your name, and they don't need to give your a free name change.

It doesn't make sense on any level mate.

If ur bank / provider considers this friendly fraud for reasons the merchant / bank decides do not constitute a charge back you could lose ur CC account or PayPal account.

What is it selling, exactly?

I'm pretty sure it did. Besides, he's not the only one to do so. A lot of other people have done the same, and if enough people do it, they will have to reconsider. You, on the other hand, sound  like a dick.

Ya he looks like he likes em real young!

You can always sue, but if you are successful they'd appeal and the EU court would take their side. Otherwise it would create a precedent where companies would have to delete accounts and perform every other GDPR action without being able to verify that it was requested by the owner, which would be chaos.
---
Right?
---
Video games is fun so let's ignore the real world because we like our games.
---
Right, so you think you get to decide what people should or shouldn't discuss on this subreddit ?
---
&gt; The Mods should ban Hearthstone discussion until Blizzard resolves this.
---
You think this isn't censorship ?
---
We're on the Hearthstone subreddit, if you want to cry about Blizzard sucking on Chinese money then by all means do it on the appropriate subreddits, instead of spamming your crap every day here and actively suppressing any discussion related to the game itself.

Statement from the team "The team is fully aware of recent events and we are discussing future plans for Team Hong Kong with our players. Please allow time for us to make the proper and right decision, thank you for your support as always."

See? Not that hard to make a public statement while still keeping your options open. Lets people know you're at least aware of it.
---
&gt;Have you ever tried working within the bureaucracy of a massive international corporation where you certainly are not the sole individual assisting in the creation of a response, which will have massive consequences for you personally if it blows up in your face in any one of a myriad ways and the company generally?
---
Do you have any greater arguments than blindly suggesting ekargvintage doesn't know what they are talking about?
---
Correct, they do. And it’s our right, as consumers, to not support companies that take actions to make profits which we feel are so morally wrong they shouldn’t be doing them. Nobody is arguing Blizzard should’ve gone and denounced China out of the blue, but now that they’ve gone this far to appease them, that’s an issue. Blizzard made this political, not us.
---
Unless he made another announcement, Kibler only said he wouldn't be commentating events anymore (and even then only for Grandmasters).

Not that anything would come out of the fact that Blizzard didnt let Users delete their Account for a couple of hours, literally no Government would do something about that.

I am just clarifiyng that the EU Data Protection laws would matter to Blizzard, if it would have been a drastic event. In the end there are always some loopholes there anyway, so i Hope you understand what i Wanted to say.
---
Anyway have a Good evening :)
---
Real men play Magic Arena.
---
Fucking Tiannamen Square.
---
Ten thousand protesters were killed, and the pictures gruesome as all hell.
---
Unless you don't count that as 'seeing it with my own eyes'.  Pray tell, what American atrocities have you seen with your own eyes?
---
i doubt anyone planning to protest really gives a fuck about being ejected. for some, thats the plan.
---
We don't need another post from everyone who thinks shows of solidarity are pointless - yet here you are.
---
I might be wrong but I don't think Blizzcon is going to happen at all this year.  They will give refunds and put out some trailers on YT with maybe some developer insight videos to replace dev panels.
---
I imagine that very few Blizz employees will actually want to work Blizzcon now so they won't be adequately staffed unless they hire some third party event company.  None of the Q&amp;A's are going to be on topic.  There's potential safety risks if emotions get too heated.
---
At this point there's no real benefit for Blizzard doing Blizzcon this year.
---
Well, they gotta eat, right? But standing up is good nonetheless. 
---
I’d like them to stop streaming too, but im surely not gonna condemn them for playing still. This is their job, they and their families gotta eat. At least tbey arent silent and that’s good
---
First of all its gaming platform thats censors non gaming content (like /r/gaming deletede my post bcz it didnt have any game content ). Its people fault they think blizzard  has to side someone\`s  political side.
---
You got links to those cosplayers etc? I'd like to hold them accountable when Blizzcon is over and they didn't show up.
---
You buy amibos, unless you burn your amibo collection you're a proud supporter of the CCP.
---
&gt;your giving Blizzard a reason to ignore us.
---
Oh. Do they even need those? I thought they were too busy with China to pay attention to the west. I thought Chinese money was good enough for them to ignore us all.
---
HOW
---
Exactly. He made a political comment when his contract forbid him to do so. He was rightfully punished and it has no bearing on Blizzards political beliefs. The whole hate on Blizzard mob is hilariously uneducated to the actual reason
---
Unless people get Blizzard banned in China anyway by using their characters as protest icons. It's a long shot but it'll be very satisfying if it happens.
---
Nice try Chinese government propaganda worker.
---
Blizzards "official" response is currently decided several levels above team 5. I doubt anyone with knowledge of that has talked to Kibler
---
I agree that unsub/deletion is not the only way to act. But it's valid. And lets keep in mind - the industry we are talking about is not really in a position where one have to worry about losing their job and not finding another within really short period (be it weeks or months). And it's not ours responsibility to think about Blizzard treating their employees like trash just because it cannot stand protests. I am gay and would never in my life buy in Chick-fil-A because of their support for gay-bashing. And I won't think twice about their management or any other worker losing job because plenty of GSRM won't eat there. It's really similar situation and I am gonna repeat myself: it's not our job to think about possibility of Blizzard firing employees. That is completely another thing and should be managed by trade unions.
---
Even when they say something, ignore their words and watch their actions. PR is all lies and manipulation anyways; focus on the hard reality.
---
You have 200 social credit points added to your card!

---
I agree Morhaime would have done something or at the least said something on this issue by now.  The fact that J Allen Brack and the management at Blizzard is just sticking their head in the sand is really just making it so much worse and sickening.  Absolute cowards.  Brack should absolutely resign if this is his approach to a scandal.
---
With 20 best friends those wolfs they stay in your deck even after winning or losing
---
Assuming Blizzard had any say when or how that account could respond?
---
You got it.
---
So that's what happened last year with 800 people or so? Oh. They were fired because the record profits weren't record enough...
---
I do feel sorry for them. And the ones before them.
---
As ive said in 100 othe rplaces now:
---
China, Russia, America, Europe, everywhere, 99.999% of the people simply want to work, live, have a family, travel, eat interesting foods and meet interesting new people. We are basically all the same in those peaceful desires. 
---
Unrest throughout all of history is caused by a very small sliver of a fraction of those in power that have slowly become more corrupt over time and the system as a monolith is moves with it over decades of small changes. After a certain time, something breaks. HK finally had enough and you see what is going on. America will likely be next in 10-30 years. 
---
Unraveling brainwashing is no easy business, but you can always tell the tell-tail signs: Censorship &amp; difficulty to get an education. 
---
Brainwashing takes place not in some empty room over a few months, but in the 'freedom' of the open world over generations. Do you think it is an accident education is harder and harder to get in America? Do you think its a mistake that someone like Trump got into office? You keep the population fearful and paranoid, but you let them know you have power to protect them, and they will stay stupid and they will fight for you and all you want. Society is sick, but they are not evil. Chinas people are not evil. Its the tiny fraction. They are loud and paid well though money or recognition they think they get in that circle. The rest have been conditioned, and they dont know. Most people are good....but lost.

He didn't quit Hearthstone. He just quit as caster for Grand Masters. He'll continue to stream and do Omnistone.
---
I don't disagree with your points. We'll see out it plays out.
---
However, I wanted to point out that this is now about far more than the Hearthstone incident. The combination of the South Park episode, the NBA incident, and the HS incident has created this massive snowball where now the issue at stake is nothing less than the core values of Western freedom in our media. This is why politicians and mass media are getting involved. Of course nobody outside the gaming sphere cares about Blizzard. But a lot more people care about freedom of speech, censorship and self-censorship.
---
FUCK APPLE!

Oh yeah, those.

China has no dignity. The government is run by cowards. President Xi is a dictator. The Chinese people deserve better, but they’ll never get it unless they over throw and revolt against the regime.

This idea that they should immediately respond is so ridiculous. Do you really not see how extremely complex of a situation they're in, how much is at stake (not just profits but the jobs of innocent people) based on how they respond?

This is the most genius post I have seen on this subreddit!
---
Max is 20 tryed more but they don't stay
---
I remember seeing some numbers and they actually make a lot more money from the Americas than China.
---
Also it's not just about what China does in their country. Few people cared enough for that before this whole fiasco because that shit stayed in China.
---
This is China using it's economic power to strong arm an American company to silence dissent.
---
Also what the fuck does it matter to you then if people are upset? So Blizz has a right as a company (not even a person) to do whatever they like and people can't get upset over it?
---
Instead of telling Blizz to you know not silence speech you're instead here trying to silence speech. Unless you're just voicing your opinion which hey feel free to do so.
---
The point is that ultimately Blizz was founded in America by Americans who believe that as humans we have a certain set of inalienable rights that cannot be infringed upon.
---
China is actively trying to infringe upon those rights by twisting the arm of a company that so desperately wants thar Chinese money. Blizz as a company is free to operate that way. We as consumers and as free people are free to boycott them for doing so.
---
Such is the beauty of a free Democratic society.

Yeah you just need control over a moderately sized botnet

Yes. These boycotting idiots actually think deleting a profile on a card game = supporting human rights. It’s sad how uneducated this sub is.
---
What ? Are you retarded ?

What do you mean inspiration? The original image was the hearthstone logo and I did a bit of photoshop here, a touch of sbubby there and voila

You are a joke.

Reported for telling you why you're a hypocrite?
---
No you're right man. I've been on reddit for 6 years, never said anything positive about Blizzard, but blizzard has been paying me a retainer in case they need me. The controversy hit and they dropped a big bonus check in my account.
---
Is that what you think? You should stop shilling for dumb people.

https://cosplay.kotaku.com/the-inevitable-cosplay-of-overwatchs-mei-supporting-hon-1838932238

Thats the real question
---
Bobby Kotick is CEO of ActivisonBlizzard, so the decision--or at least the general policy that lead to the decision--was probably made somewhere between him and Brack, though it might have come from the board of directors.
---
They gave their statement, they sided with China. It doesn't have to be from the US branch to be considered Blizzard's stance
---
No, only rice
---
Alright so if I go with your (really stupid) argument you guys are all basically fully supporting CCP too because you all have at the very least one product from China in your house. What a really amazingly stupid argument lol!
---
So basically if you own a product coming from a certain country you are not allowed to criticize a company here supporting the regime in said other country? What kind of ridiculously stupid flawed argument is that seriously???
---
Anyway lemme just face palm here and leave you guys: you seem very busy sucking Blizz's dick.
---
Dude, you're wasting your breath. These people aren't interested in discussion.
---
The silence is what you'd expect from a big corporate developer like EA or the other half of Activision-Blizzard.
---
We're in the post-Morhaime era.  It's a sad time, but it was a great 25+ years.
---
OMG someone might lose they're job because we are protesting a regime that harvest organs from prisoners, shoots protestors, is disappearing thousands of people, and imprisoning millions just because they are a minority. Wow what a fucking take
---
Look im willing to get a plane ticket . Have been meaning to go on a holiday anyway
---
This! It’s all about creating a barrier to them entering China. They decided the money from China mattered more than morals and freedom of the people. By doing this, it could stifle Blizzard’s use in China and therefore making them lose out on what they so wanted in the first place: Money.
---
I can feel the ignorance radiating from this post. Take a down chump
---
Thank you!
---
I don't think I need to address what you said about Canada to get my point across, which is that comparing the propaganda in China to that in the west (even if it's "spread differently") is laughable.  If your point is "the west does it too so it's fine when the Chinese do it", that's just not a good point.  The scale of what the Chinese government is doing compared to the west is scary, as seen when they can influence American companies like Blizzard.  You say we worship the military and the police over here but there's been a huge movement in the states for example to increase oversight and reform the criminal justice system.  This is being talked about publicly by regular citizens and high level officials.  When the air force bombs a doctor's without borders camp, that's obviously a tragedy and someone needs to be held accountable, but the fact that the public actually fucking knows about it means we can pursue lines of inquiry and maybe get some fucking justice for that action.  As an American, I am not limited to just the state news.  I can look at the new york times, the BBC, the Russian Times, Fox, or Al Jazeera.  Obviously not all those sources are the same in terms of reputation, but the point is that I can decide for myself what my world view is based on a shit load of sources.  If I was a Chinese citizen, my choices are CCTV or I can risk using a VPN to get outside media.  My government also doesn't ban media for "infringement of sovereignty".
---
I don't really care if people are calling me an ignorant American or downvoting me here.  I want you to understand that in a world where an authoritarian state like China is becoming increasingly able to influence the discourse in the west, it is incredibly dangerous to write it off and say "well the west does it too, they're just more sneaky about it".
---
I think that still isn’t censorship, no. At least not government censorship, which is the only kind I have a problem with. 
---
Nope. These are the popular subreddits. These are where the message needs to be spread. If you want it to go away faster, then help us get Blizzard’s attention and vote with your wallet. We would welcome your support.
---
They had a choice to never go into Chinese market, then had a choice to not do esports, then had a choice to not do any interviews.
---
True. Epstein was in the news for about 2 days and now nobody talks about him. Same with the Amazon being on fire, not a peep for weeks now.
---
Turkey invaded Syria and that barely got any attention due to the Blizzard drama.
---
&gt; you have no right to criticize people who are still playing **unless** you are boycotting all these companies as well. 
---
If there are free speech rights from where they're from, of course they have a right to.
---
You can call them out for their hypocrisy if you like but don't be like China and say that don't have a right to critical speech.
---
Neither rest of the world tho...
---
It's spelled ackshually btw
---
Yes let have an American country sue a government controlled company and see if it works out. What is your fucking logic? How are they gonna sue NETEASE? A Chinese company? Would the chinese government side with blizzard or with netease? And what good would sueing NETEASE In US does? What even is this logic????

It's about not supporting American companies who will go to bat for the CCP. Blizzard and other companies want the Chinese market, and these are the lengths they'll go to to keep it. This protest is us saying that they can have the Chinese market, but they won't have ours, in their own home country.
---
Money
---
Trump was happy to use the NBA's similar issues with China to bash Steve Kerr and Greg Popvich (to a lesser extent). I can't imagine why Trump would view the Blizzard situation any differently.
---
Artifact?
---
but also: look to branch out. kick up a storm in other places as well. donate to human rights organisations, or to the protestors themselves if you can find a way. discuss the issue with the people around you. memes are funny and attention-grabbing but they fade pretty quickly too. think about if you can build something a bit longer-lasting.
---
I was nervous that I’d see Nintendo

Thank you for being the first person to understand that you can refer to someone by just their last name. Saying "J Allen Brack" every time would be like typing "Donald J Trump" instead of just Trump Everytime.

I thought that just meant 'couldn't be dispelled'. Neat.

Went to check it out, and yeah I am down to 20 again on the next playthrough.
---
It’s not a bad thing, but it is breaking contract, and Blitzchung was well aware of the consequences of his actions. They were more severe than they should have been, but that doesn’t mean there shouldn’t have been any.
---
I love how you think you are the saint, that whatever you heard on the Western news must be all true, and unbiased, so now you must take up your pitchfork and be the holy champion and angel savior of human rights, because your definition is the most saint.
---
People who want politics to stay out of e-sports? How dare they? Either boycott Hearthstone or you are all scums! 
---
People here wanting to enjoy a card game does not equate to not supporting human rights. But according to you? No, EVERYONE ELSE must give up on Hearthstone or they have Chinese cum in their mouth!
---
The German said something similar in the 1930s regarding people who didn't want to exterminate Jews. I'm glad you have adopted that same mentality when it comes to makinh people to do what you think is right *by force*.

It's not that we want this to be swept under the rug but posts have gotten to the point where they arnt even related to hearthstone, and at that point the discussion should be moved to a more appropriate sub ex r/hongkong
---
I'd like to know what you think would happen if China left Hong Kong completely.
---
With the CPC, it's less like Fox or CNN, but more like Breitbart or ShareBlue.
---
Blizzard took a side by disqualifying him and taking the prize money. You brought up alot of examples that you wish proved your point but you have zero idea what people's political ideas are and your just putting words in their mouth. It's a straw man. This isn't a political sub and it would never talk about politics, except someone in the community who earned the highest achievement was silenced for his opinion. Ofc this sub would be mad, someone they like was done dirty. 
---
The hate is justified, there were other ways to resolve the issue.
---
In all fairness, he also was in the competitive Hearthstone scene before he turned 18. Of course he was going to grow up in that time lol.

But why would you want 34 1/1 charge taunts in your deck though? I dont get it.
---
To be fair, this list isn't exhaustive. Nintendo is actually selling switches in China through Tencent, the Chinese company that bought some ownership of Reddit.
---
Oof - I think you actually killed him.
---
I mean, you probably will.  It's been like a day and a half and this is the third thread on this subreddit beseeching people to cling to their rage.  They're not gonna make it three weeks.
---
I’m just gonna ask out of curiosity were you there? If not than your reasoning is the same as mine and what I said earlier we don’t know what happened behind the curtains all we can see is what we see at face value also free speech in China isn’t the same as it is here and it never has been idk if a lot of people really knew that or not cause in a lot of other countries speaking out usually involves bullets to the head or executions but hey he spoke out let him and the cast and commentators just keep listening to him while they round them up for listening to “propaganda” but good on him
---
Their situation is completely different tho.
---
Perhaps not, but it's the best workable solution Europe has had so far to foster peace, cooperation and democracy. If we can everything that doesn't end with perfection, we end with nothing.
---
The NBAs salary cap is rumored to shrink 20% due to China being mad and pulling back.  This is big money and really showing certain companies and peoples true colors.
---
I completely agree, it alarms me how many people's initial response was to criticise Blitzchung's words as being 'political', when it reality, for me at least, bringing awareness to human rights violations around the world should be far from a 'political statemen't, but rather a matter of human decency akin to raising awareness of topics like testicular cancer, ALS or climate change.
---
Then again, we now live in a world where talking about Climate Change is also seen as a political statement, so we really are living in the darkest timeline.
---
&gt; I haven't been convinced that any human rights violation have even occurred if I'm being honest.
---
Oh I see, so you're just in complete denial and/or actually approve of human rights violations. Good for you. That also means I don't have to read the rest of your shit, 'cause I'm sure as hell not gonna waste my time arguing with a CPC shill, or someone who actively approves of them.
---
That wasn’t nearly the same situation.

---
Stop clouding your mind by belittling this to *just a video game thing* and think about this as an intentional business issue in regards to greedily appeasing a totalitarian government for money. 
---
They took no time at all to appease china and unjustly punish the player and casters but are conveniently silent in the face of a full scale boycott with many political figures constantly weighing in on said issue? Why is that in of itself not something you should find very troubling? Do you have any answers to my questions or more dismissive "calm down buddy" because that helps nothing really.
---
Why don't you go elsewhere? Clearly you're not in the right spot right now if you're upset.
---
Yeah your like the 500th person to post this
---
What could they possibly say that would re synchronize your morality with theirs? They've already shattered there core values. At this point anything they do short denouncing China is not going to be sufficient. An apology is not going to be suitable because they've already shown they'll lick The regime's boots.
---
I'm genuinely curious what would appease you? Since personally I've played for decades and I couldn't stand behind it, and personally feel its irredeemable at this time since it's clearly about dollars now and the old guard and heart is dead. I love a good redemption story and I believe in second chances but this year alone they've went threw several.
---
Jesus Christ, you feel good about that title?

They sure seemed to issue the ban quickly, and the follow up statement retroactively justifying it.

---
Let's hope it doesn't die, but seeing the "kind" of people that are actually posting about HK right now, I highly doubt it.
---
Ok then go to r/blizzard
---
May I ask just what freedom and human rights you are talking about here? Hong Kong was and has always been part of the China, that until they get colonized by the Brits. Chinese government FREED them after the war and other shit decades ago. Hong Kong get to keep their Britain colonization heritages, including all kinds of social systems and everything long as they admit they are part of China. They have always had freedom since then, more free than mainland anyway. Unrestricted internet, freedom to vote and speech. But they are always looking for a chance to be “independent”. And they found one month ago, you can google that. That’s how all this started. Their rights has not been violated in any ways
---
The people you talking about who’s boycotting this? They are in this WESTERN community. Of course most of them would align their opinion to the ideology of the west, and to the majority of the western people. After all, why would they voice an opinion that is against their targeted audience? They don’t do it out of a sense of “justice”, but rather out of convenience.
---
I’m telling you there is no justice in this situation. Both sides are ugly, and other parties are just in for their own gains, whatever that is.
---
&gt;I get a lot of people are worked up, but for everyone that deletes their account, if you ever want to play Blizzard games again, you have to buy licenses again or adventures for Hearthstone, or whatever it is you play.
---
Yes, that's kind of the point. That's why people delete their accounts, they'll not be as likely to get enticed back into Blizzard's ecosystem because their investment (both psychological and physical) has vanished.
---
Blizzard produces games as a service now, not singular one-time-purchase products. Losing accounts that would otherwise be potential sources of revenue is very bad for them.
---
Nah, ASIA, including S. korea, Japan and China, is about 12% of blizzards revenue.
---

---
So no, they won't make more money.
---
We kept Area 51 memes around for months and that was a joke. This is a serious issue and we have proven we can keep bringing things up. We have 21 days to make Blizzcon basically a disaster for Blizzard and Activision and to show that we do take this seriously
---
Damn, sorry to hear that. Definitely would hurt streaming if it's crashing on you
---
The point in part is to be annoying I think. It should be more annoying to have foreign authoritative governments dictating American companies freedom of speech policy.
---
If this were a political sub then you’d be right, but it’s not, it’s a fking hs sub and I haven’t seen any normal hs related posts in days. So you clearly lost my point.
---
Honestly, I'm all pro Hong Kong. Hell, I am in the camp that Tibet and Inner Mongolia should go free as well. I've been to China, and they can barely keep up their own villages (seriously, some of them have no infrastructure, no electricity, no power, and one shitty car for something like 300+ people), let alone keep those three under control.
---
At the same time, I enjoy Hearthstone. I've not spent a cent on it, and this just makes me more certain that I don't want to do that. Because, and correct me if I'm wrong here, me just playing a free game, doesn't actually give Blizz anything. However, I WILL NOT be subscribing to WoW classic, as I intended. Ergo, I'm enjoying myself, supporting the protestors, and screw over Blizz.
---
Does anyone else get a mechanical/robotic/automatic feeling over posts like this one? "C'mon guys let's never forget what blizzard has done" sets off this feeling for me.
---
I know it is almost pointless but I'm still holding out hope before deleting my account.  I have about 15 days played on classic and love it.  I'd play for years more if they just give me the slightest hope that they were not Capital E evil.  I cancelled my wow and deleted the launcher but the longer they say nothing the closer I get to deleting my whole account.
---
I don’t think it’s that vague. Just don’t bring up politics in your moment of fame.
---
How does this card work? Like, how do you "combine with more friends"? I don't get this card at all
---
I really think that the people who made the decision on Blitzchung were mainland Chinese and did so without input from other regions. And now the US based execs are trying to figure out how not to lose billions in goodwill from western nations, while not getting kicked out of mainland China. The inaction from Blizzard is because I don't see any good third alternative, and I suspect, neither do they.
---
Yes. That said, if they properly apologize I wouldn't mind taking back every negative thing I've said recently about them.

Unless they were all lying and everything was staged (Which, while possible, is highly improbable) N. Korea is a very... Well.. different world. And not in a good way.
---
Go to r/competitivehs maybe?
---
I think it's because the decision on Blitzchung was made by mainland Chinese based executives to satisfy their market, while the decision on AU was made by US based executives to satisfy their market.
---
The hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in times of great moral crises maintain their neutrality.- John F Kennedy
---
True, it is disappointing but it's the reality. And it's a good thing this happened, so people now know what the reality is. What the people haven't understood yet, though, that this was not an exception limited to Blizzard, but a theme that has been going within companies expanding into China for decades. Putting all the blame on Blizzard for not upholding moral values is like blaming a general for a war. There are much larger corporations like Microsoft, Google or Apple who have much lower moral standards and people are still using their products despite all the shady business, which is partially even well-known. So now, even the mainstream media picked up on that, and the politicians and large corporations got an opportunity to put a finger on Blizzard to divert the attention away from themselves and act as if they haven't been doing similar and worse things.

Concerning the casters I guess I have to agree as I haven't thought about them obviously having higher-ups who must have greenlit the whole thing, otherwise the casters probably wouldn't have done that. But who knows, before that happened a lot of people might not have been aware about the whole situation and might not have been able to predict that massive outrage this would spark. I'm sure Blitzchung didn't imagine what scale all of this would reach. Well, it's all fun and games until it isn't. Now people yell for Blizzard to return him his winnings while he had already cost them thousands, if not millions.
---
Now that's monstrous
---

---
Oh no I totally agree with you.
---
I know that there’s very passionate people here who really want to hear explicit condemnation
---
But I’m more than satisfied with what Tom said. Like I said, I think others should follow his example, because this is the right way of doing things for someone in his spot.
---
Hope I didn’t give the impression that I wasn’t impressed with his actions
---
For me, this means A LOT.
---
Amnesiac is the first ever NA/EU player in the Grandmaster ecosystem that has got the balls to support Blitzchung, while other players &amp; casters remain silent.
---
I do not blame the others, but HUGE respect for this young man. I do hope that he will not suffer severe consequences for speaking out.
---
I played a Yogg the other day with lethal on board. He didn’t take my win, but the first spell he cast was Shadowflame on himself, I found that pretty funny. Would’ve been even better if the opponent had a board to clear.

Hearthstone was primely involved so this our new playground. Where else can we exchange anti-Blizzard Hearthstone memes?
---
Yet this whole controversy is still hearthstone related so im not sure i see a problem here.
---
Brilliant
---
I didn't say that the teacher was right. I just hate it when people assume they are correct because they're getting spoon-fed news that could be fake. Like the people eating up all the dumb shit Trump has said since he was elected.

I got banned 2 years ago for a month for saying that Christie Goldens writing was garbage.
---
When I asked what rule I broke, they said if I asked again, they would say I was harassing a Blizzard Employee and ban my WoW account.
---
legend :) very nice of you to do this. I will do the same
---
No, no no they are off limits!!!!! They had nothing to do with this!!!! Don’t threaten someone just because they still play blizzards games.
---
Mods lock this shit!
---
It would be nice if someone in Blizzard PR actually explained this to us mere peasants.
---
If you think that somebody here in the US has any control over the Blizzard Weibo account, then you need to get your head checked.
---
Blizzard-Taiwan is obviously in China's pocket and is running around ruining Blizzard's name while the community eats it up and even helps them do it.
---
Of course it does, but, just like with the overwhelming majority of these type of things, it won't.
---
This community dumb as shit!
---
Wait so do you or do you not want blizzard to punish people?
---
Looking at stock prices is a pretty good indicator in real time of what’s REALLY happening. While ActivisionBlizzards stock took a 4% hit on the news, most of that loss has been made up already. That tells me people with deep connections to Blizzard are either really out of touch or they don’t think this is going to have any significant impact on earnings.
---
For me this isn't a "It'll blow over" thing. I'm actually done. I have banned Activision, Blizzard, and Tencent from my PC. 
---
Then when they apologized to Beijing this got added to my list of Psychotic Fucking Hatreds.
---
Ah yes, the time when slavery was legal and EVERY AMERICAN OWNED SLAVES
---
Except no, they ducked under the table.
---
It’s called sparkles - Feb 2018 card back.
---
I think the Blizzard mods misunderstood.  It's pretty simple, just ask them to screenshot the modlog and it will say if Admins took action though.  It seems like people are prematurely raising pitchforks to me.
---
We will protest at Blizzcon too. Blizzcon will be another fail :)
---
Their stocks are dropping and we will make sure it continues to.
---
You're underselling it. Mike Donais regularly posts here and he's the damn lead designer. Brode before him. Those are big deals that the leads of such a huge game would interact on an unofficial forum. I remember Ben saying in 2016 they look to this sub more for input than they do the official forums. 
---
It's nice to have their opinion show up from time to time and also nice to know they've not tried to influence how this sub is acting in light of the controversy. That's not how it is on all gaming subs (coughleagueoflegendscough).
---
Nah you won't get people to stop, and you can't make anyone stop, and you know that and are complaining anyway to see if your opinion is validated.
---
It isn't.
---
A decently large portion of the player base is quitting the game. I thought it'd be smaller but there's actually a lot of players (whales included) leaving the game. Not going to kill the game, but certainly not helpful considering the playerbase has been dropping for a while now.
---
Also, there's definitely NOT "hundreds of millions of players each month". Wikipedia cites 37 millions, and that was over a year ago, so I wouldn't be surprised if the actual current number was smaller.
---
When an employee screws up really badly, he loses his job.  
---
When a leader screws up really badly, losing his job is how the company shows they hold themselves accountable.  
---
The leader not losing his job shows they don't care.   Customers can react accordingly.
---
That would be you, yes.
---
&gt; this reminds me a lot of football players kneeling during the national anthem and being called unpatriotic
---
Hmm, that sucks how they were fired for having an opinion.
---
This. Fuck Blizzard, I will never buy another product from them. I hope Blizzcon gets wrecked by protesters.
---
Context in the comments of op
---
Hmmm
---
Oh I didnt realize you were going to leave your mothers basement and go to blizcon in that case please continue
---
r/facepalm
---
The Winnie the Pooh masks must be expensive, none are made in China, lol.
---
they already have your money, they don't give a shit.
---
Yeah, it is.
---
Because I think the outrage is ridiculous and don't have much interest in the circlejerk of keyboard warriors.  Pretty simple.  
---
Best part is that in the end, I'll be right.  While everyone else is desperately trying to stoke the fading rage, I just have to play hearthstone and wait.  This week's tavern brawl is fun.
---
What if you were already f2p?
---
I heard a rumor there was to be an all-employee announcement meeting today or tomorrow on this subject. I bet we won’t hear anything more publicly until that happens (which is the right thing to do imho)
---
Nobody deserves bondage. Wtf.
---
Pressuring streamers and influences to make statements is fine.
---
But do *not* paint targets on them. It is very easy to, from our positions, ask others to endanger their livelihoods. That is a big ask. They are not to blame.
---
The difference is, what you just said is the individual choosing to censor content for themselves, instead of the government censoring the content for them.
---
Why I can’t check multiple boxes?
---
They are too busy shitting bricks trying to figure out how to un-fuck the mess Blizzard-Taiwan put in their lap.
---
I won't, but many will. We dress up at Winnie the pooh and heckle during the Q&amp;A. It will be glorious.
---
Someone give this man a medal, I'm broke. I just bought my mask from amazon.
---
Rich and stupid if you get another one lmao
---
Bobby Kotick in a Blizzsuit.
---
Hi all. I do some volunteer work for a human rights agency that's been working with some individuals in HK to help out. I am curious what members of this community have done. A common problem with issues like this is people discuss their outrage, maybe even boycott a company, but do little else. I would like to get a sense for what members of r/hearthstone have done. Thank you
---
Depends if China is giving him condo deals at the time like they were last year.
---
Oh yeah that right you're probably allergic to being outside, you know from being a reddit goblin 24/7 my bad
---
And on top of that those boycotting are using devices made in full or in part in China, and buying other products made in China
---
&gt;  almost got banned from the Overwatch League for posting a pepe 
---
(kek)
---
Kind of like r/The_Duchebag but Chinese
---
lol.  wow.  the naivety here is quite astounding.
---
It's been kind of fun to see these Hearthstone kids mature over the years, from impulsive teenagers to thoughtful adults.
---
Still, this is a good example of the ignorance rampant in this whole mess.  So many people understand so little of what is actually going on and just want to get mad and jump on the anti-blizzard bandwagon.
---
I fear (but expect) the outrage will die out and people will feel fulfilled after some sort of punishment is given to blizzard. Once that's done, everyone will go back to their lives and forget that Hong Kong is still protesting for their rights.
---
This is the information ive been looking for, what part of the GDPR specifically refers to proof of identity? Because if its left to blizzards discretion in the very near future i see them asking for birth certificate, proof of residence, and a family members information to confirm proof of identity. And what exactly is to stop them from doing so?
---
Edit: ah, here we go. https://iapp.org/news/a/how-to-verify-identity-of-data-subjects-for-dsars-under-the-gdpr/
---
Some interesting excerpts;
---
"How can I be penalized for doing my best to authenticate the data subjects?
---
Basically, if you make it too difficult for the data subjects to exercise their rights, by creating for them unreasonable and disproportionate requirements, you will in fact infringe the very basic rights of the data subjects. This way, you risk the highest administrative fines, that is up to 20,000,000 euros, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4 percent of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.
---
It is highly recommended that you do not obtain clearly more sensitive or potentially more harmful data, for the purpose of authentication, than the data that is subject to the request. If you actually need some additional information, it should be the minimum amount and only what is relevant in the given context. This is important not only because of the principle of data minimization, but also to ensure purpose limitation and fairness.  
---
Accordingly, the highest administrative fines, as provided by the GDPR, may fall upon you."
---
And:
---
"What should be specifically avoided?
---
Asking for a copy of ID document, passport or other official, government-issued document, such as a birth certificate, as a standard way of verifying the identity of data subjects should be definitely avoided.
---
The obvious reason why is because it is disproportionate and not always relevant. The less obvious reason is that this is not considered a secure and efficient method of authentication, and the level of assurance as to the real identity of a person, in contrast to what some might think, is quite low. 
---
Authentication in an online environment is widely disputed, and most people will tell you that you should not use the information that basically stays the same for all your life or for a long period of time, such as Social Security numbers or government issued identifiers, as it is likely that such data may already be in possession of unauthorized persons, simply because they exist for a long time. Also, if this would be a prevalent practice, many companies would be, and sometimes already are, in possession of such information, and they very often fall pray to breaches and hacker attacks.
---
Last but not least, by collecting such information, you will create additional risks for data subjects, as such data may be used, for identity theft or fraud, for example, and you will need to protect it with higher security measures than for the innocuous data that is subject to the request itself, e.g., history of purchased items or the like. Quite likely you would need, under the GDPR, to conduct the data protection impact assessment before implementing such method of authentication."
---
Not only HK but also many ethnic minorities..
---
And the point is not blindly hating on Blizzard...
---
The point is hating people who do not support this gracious, awesome movement in Hong Kong
---
Why support the Goliath, when they're clearly wrong?...
---
Blizzard is not getting 'harassed'. They made a choice and they got fair repercussions for it..
---
Our brothers and sister in Hong Kong cannot be silenced. Democracy HAS to win...
---
In addition, the mainland might see some of this and start their own protests, which would probably happen in some cases but not blow up....
---
Anyway, the point is.....
---
We have to stand up against China and stand for Hong Kong, Blizzard not supporting human rights and free speech is appalling, and their fanbase rightfully finds it so....
---
If you don't want to personally delete your account, that's fine, no-one's forcing you, their games are addictive, i'll give them that.
---
But you cannot deny what they're doing for money is immoral.
---
I do understand there's rules about keeping politics out of the streams and whatnot, but taking the prize money away, the banning and apology to China?????
---
Yeah, nah. Screw this company.
---
Grunde Almeland is a man. *The* man if you will.
---
I bet the blizzard name will cease to exist
---
You can still enjoy your old NON SUB blizzard games (everything pre 2010).  
---
EVERY SINGLE 'recurring profit" GAME can suck our collective dicks. And *every* new release.
---
The way this whole thing has blown up puts paid to your claims.
---
The stock is way down from it’s high last year
---
Grunde Almeland, venstre.
---
Is there a none option?
---
r/iamatotalpieceofshit
---
lmao if trump tariffed this
---
I did not open HS since this happened, trying to have good times in the new Mario Kart
---
Influencers, stooges, vetting, censoring, hiding player counts... It's all just one big flimsy deception. Anything to avoid facing reality.
---
37,000,000 players each month is still a huuuuuuuge amount. Maybe 1% of people will actually fully quit playing blizzard games from this
---
Decklist?
---
I love that Blizzard's response to people revolting over someone being handed a wildly over-the-top punishment is to *ban them for a thousand years*
---
Call me neckbeard all you want. At least I don't support money over human rights. FUCK BLIZZARD.
---
I thought the dollar signs were pretty explicit.  With no context, I would agree with you.
---
I'd have so much more respect for these if I just saw one that wasn't using a referral link.
---
A Person is smart, People are dumb, ignorant masses.
---
Good point, I guess you are "going (to continue to be) f2p".
---
That was supposed to be the answer for people who are going to play but not spend.
---
Think of it like the joke, I used to like Mitch Hedberg. I still do but I used to too.
---
You are a disgusting human. Truthfully. You probably don't stand for anything and you distract reality with constantly playing hearthstone. Pretty obvious from your response. 
---
Here's a real reality check : peoples livelihoods are more important than you sitting at your computer and playing a game. When you finally wake up and start taking a stand, you'll understand.
---
Just reading this message should tell everyone how delusional you really are. Are you currently wearing a tinfoil hat so that we can't read your brain and such? If not, you should really get on that. 
---
Also, Trump is a reptile that is being controlled by Chinese aliens.
---
I once sold my ferrari for more amazon points.  I feel you bros
---
If that was the cases they could have literally immediately come out and said:
---
"Sorry guys, local blizzard fucked up, they were too harsh", and rolled back part of the punishment.
---
Besides, we're talking about withholding 10k Dollars from a guy. That decision was definitely not made without the involvement of the parent company in the US.
---
Blizzard Taiwan is still a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard. And Activision Blizzard has complete sway over them.
---
You do realize I am just wasting your time so you stop spamming this sub with shit right?
---
Boycott Blizzcon or everyone that goes, have a T-shirt that backs HK or says fuck China =) so any video's or pic of people  will make China mad =)
---
Currently you’re oversea or accessing VPN?

They banned me on the forums without any explanation.

Fuck Blizzard and fuck China!

I'm going to change my username to alter geo-political relations

Downvoted for speaking the truth. This timeline is truly the darkest
---
lol

I can assign from mobile. Fair rule, should stay active. Bad redditor imo
---
Thanks!
---
Lol Trump has been harder on China than any President in the last 40 years, plus openly criticized NBA figures like Steve Kerr who are constantly talking about the need to speak about important political issues yet issued a “No Comment” when asked directly about the HK/China situation.
---
Get a clue. “LoL tRuMp BaD”
---
there is a screenshot posted by a mod somewhere in that tread bro its not a misunderstanding. i get you are just fact checking but this is real my friend. go search through the comments.                                       "This submission was not removed by any of our moderators. This image was removed by Reddit. The Reddit Admins has terminated their account. Please do not contact us about it.

Before or after praising Xi for becoming president for life?

&gt; “Congratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People’s Republic of China!”
---
&gt; "He's now president for life. President for life. No, he's great,"... "And look, he was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day."

---
\#FUCK the NBA.  No 2nd chances with freedom.
---
Be careful because stuff like this casts a bad light on the protest,
---
Well you just responded with that comment, so you obviously had some idea to respond and to which you did.
---
That's because the US-based blizzard did not punish Blitzchung, Blizzard-TAIWAN did.
---
This is wrong. Talk to them. Do NOT target them.
---
It's not like we didn't know it was political since the beginning, but "glad" to see a confirmation.

honk kong mei cosplays plz!!!!

Pls get help dude!

The meme has come true. This sub has truly become r/hearthstonecirclejerk

an account with data in it is still an account with data in it. this accomplishes the same as just not paying for a sub.
