Murlocs are OP because Divine Shield + Poisonous is available for an entire board.
---

---
Imagine having Nefarian with a full board of Divine Shield + Poisonous murlocs.  There really isn't a winning response except omega highroll on multiple cleaves or hyper omega highroll on cobalt guardians.
---
---
---
Let‚Äôs be real, tons of us are playing it. I am. I‚Äôm scummy for it, but I do enjoy it.
---
Nope. Not seeing how Dragon‚Äôs Pack, Faceless Corruptor and that card invoking twice are utterly broken just shows no playtesting was done whatsoever. 
---
Reacting quickly is the bare minimum after what is probably one of the worst balance fuckup in the ranked history of the game. Undertaker hunter did not feel as oppressive as this does, and that means something.
---
I mean the stuff it is intended for really isnt of any use for anyone. Sathrovarr never makes it into any deck, Zayle is used by no one, Cthun had his time in the sun but is never used anymore, Marin was never really used, and at least 2/5 Galakronds are never going to see play (Warlock and Priest). The players themselves should be able to decide if  it is useful or not to them. I just dont see the point of having some random legendaries that basically are the same as basic neutrals like yeti or stonetusk boar since im never gonna use them.
---
I'm playing it right now too. I'd feel worse about doing so if they hadn't already announced that there were nerfs coming soon, and I'm sure the novelty wears off, but having one week of using something so stupidly broken feels good.
---
And look the Mad dog who lost against a BMer is currently malding again.
---
"Just retarded" enjoying games your way having conversation in it is a bad thing for you looks like and i just gave literally one example out of many And CSGO esports players are probably more adult than you and they still do that for fun. And congrats you played sports in real life if you think Messi and Ronaldo respect each other XD. 
---
and about "kids behavior to BM" since you didn't like Ksi vs Logan example here another one.
---
Even adults BM literally even a CEO of a company does that to its competitors ( CEO of AMD after showing vide of Ryzen vs Intel ) "Looks like my little friend still not done" after intel being 10 sec late.
---
And tbh congrats for you if you think adults should just stay silent the whole game and just win and lose without having emotion like robots rather let ai play.

Noooo Omnistone! Really hope it will continue in some capacity. One of the best HS podcasts up there with Angry Chicken.
---
The escalation in this game has gotten a bit out of hand.
---
Nobody's playing it.
---
There are probably other good decks for underplayed classes that just haven't been found yet because Shaman is stomping over everything in the meta.
---
Tbh I think they should either remove the poisonous adaptation from the pool or replace Gentle Megasaur all together
---
In my defence I did try out Pure paladin and some other budget decks, but I had enough money for one more deck, so why not go for the best deck?
---
I do kinda feel guilty cause holy shit did I hate jade golem druid and it's players back in the day
---
How are you able to do the Lich king adventure? I can't find it
---
[deleted]
---
The state of the game has actually made me consider quitting forever and selling my account. Any way I can get away with that?
---
Yeah, this is by far the funnest priest to play, up there with thought steal decks. I just feel this is more consistent than those. 
---
Also I tried going all in on bad luck, but I found the deck as a whole more reliable with the inclusion of: Dread Raven, Infiltrator, Zerek, and Leeroy. Having a board of 3-4 of any of these really sets you up. 
---
I‚Äôve actually won quite a number of games just because i‚Äôve gotten grave rune off on any of those 4. Getting it off on albatross doesn‚Äôt necessarily get you the win.
---
What is wrong with small an interaction with you opponent and why are you so upset about this in a multiplayer game.
---
I don't think small hello/thanks is a bm as long as they are not spamming.
---
I always say **well played** if I'm in a losing position and give the turn to my opponent its not a big deal. They may have an amazing lethal with crazy combo I may also want to see, we both have fun. Don't be salty about small things mate grow up.
---
I‚Äôve been playing this for a few days, and I‚Äôd probably say spilt them and try for grave rune on infiltrator and reborn on the albatross. Going all in either way doesn‚Äôt usually work too well.
---
One of the worst decisions ever made by the Hearthstone design team and it seems their main motivation was just to remove a great basic set win condition for the class.
---
~~Mate00#2898 EU Trading 80g quests.~~

Edit: Completed with Hashirama.
---
Zephrys is fine powerwise. But it does feel kind of viscerally un-fun to see him come down and know that your opponent's about to pull an instant out (if not a surprise lethal).
---
On a design level, I think Highlander's just kind of an unfortunate premise because the "cost" of the deck restriction does very much exist, but it's kind of abstract - especially to its opponent (it can be quite a few turns before it's even clear you're playing Highlander). The huge power Highlander cards have in exchange for that is far more obvious. It's not necessarily broken or anything, but it can feel situationally cheap because the drawbacks are abstract and the benefits are concrete.
---
if i lose then i get mad how is it different from losing irl when i lose match in tennis? are you licensed doctor, or what? yeah i respect ur comment thanks for answer but stop spewing this random bullshit that i have BIG PROBLEMS because i get mad at games like almost literally everyone does holy shit! why is that needed? if u watch streamer of any game and he gets mad do you tell him to go to doctor because pixels anger him? i would actually say that its more healthy that you get mad at these things.
---
which card is this?
---
Same. A 12/12 on turn 4 is so wildly unfun. Makes me wanna give up playing.
---
If you can rush to 5 and get malganis it really starts to feel gross. 
---
Love it
---
You guys are assuming the cap is low.  It would be set high enough its only punishing the bots and super trihards. If you are playing that many games as f2p, than you have enough dust for more than 2 decks. Source:this is me

The measure for how good a deck is is how well it does against Shaman. It's crazy how much that one deck is warping the meta.
---
Imagine playing in the wrong order
---
Yeah exactly, I got to pull 2 synergy cards on turn 2 so I had a really oppressive early game and got to steam roll it
---
I'm oddly surprised that whatever list this is from that Shaman only has a 56% win rate?? Seems low....lol
---
To add to your point, Demons also have the additional dynamic of damaging you/costing life. This is a mechanic that is easy to use incorrectly, which could further skew Demon winrates downward with inexperienced players. That said I still think they're the hardest tribe to pull off.
---
It's any mode bro. You can just play solo content and not have to go through 3 Shaman mirrors. Just keep 1 slot clear and wait for the changes.
---
It was nerfed because it was an autoinclude in every deck because of how insane the swing turn was when you played bgh against a big threat. The other dude is correct in calling you out for saying that it pressured all big minions out of the game, as he listed a bunch of big minions that were playable and played while bgh was in game.
---
What about Baron? I win like 75-80% of the time when I go for deathrattles.
---
you did us all dirty
---
I personally think it never should have been made. No card should ever just 'give' you the perfect answer on a whim.  
---
Its definitely broken, but people like it anyway.

The card on the far right is [[Treespeaker]] which turns your treants into 5/5 Ancient tokens (the middle minions are buffed Ancients)

You said it really well, and this sentence absolutely nailed what I feel when I see it played.
---
Check now, sorry lol
---
Very balanced.
---
I think the only problem with Priest is that there is nobody playing priest in the Team 5. Maybe if they would accept sone main priest to actually give advice (removing inner fire-divine spirit wombocombo) they would do at least some cards that would synergies (i'm not even saying making priest good because the priest was really good only one time and was nerfed "machine gun priest")
---
Once upon a time, there was a meaningful cost for running a highlander deck.  
---
But now with more and more increasingly powerful Highlander specific cards as well as just the average power level of cards, you don't really give up that much for running a highlander deck.
---
Galakrond Rogue is bae, but yeah its pretty bad at dealing with the waves of 8/8 rush minions. 
---
Also fuck that card that invokes twice.
---
This thread was about emoting in hs not how losing games gets you mad. I have no comments on that sorry gl
---
Die in a fire you piece of shit
---
Oh yes flex that rank 19 shaman!
---
All the auto battler games are like this. There's 1 or maybe 2 auto win decks, a bunch of decks that get top 4, and then everything else that fails because the player didn't get lucky with transitioning into a good deck.
---
I've been playing battlegrounds because it's fun, but I have no delusion that it's anything but skill based. There's a bit of skill involved in calculating odds of course, but they don't even let you really manage economy or sideboard cards/items/etc like you can in other auto battlers.
---
I mean... that's pretty much the game winning comp of every game now.
---
I think they need this keyword, something like ‚ÄúAura.‚Äù Fixes a  lot of long standing card issues, like Coldlight Oracle, Scorerers Apprentice /Exodia Mage, and more.
---
If Galkarond does not end the game then Wok does anyway regardless of the quest. With the games only double invoke it's almost like getting the quest free anyways.
---
Thank you. Sick of playing against the same bullshit deck all the time, I love you and am now in your debt.
---
Quest the quest by itself is fine. Quest shaman was a decent deck before dod but not overpowered. It had clear strengths and weaknesses. The big problem right now is galakrond and invoke since it gives to much tempo and pressure by itself. Remember the non quest version is dominant by far right now cause quest galakrond is to slow, which was always quest shamans problem, it has a weak early game and can easily be overrun\outtempoed.
---
Nerfing the quest would destroy a whole different archetype that's not the problem right now. Quest galakrond is basically a win more deck. Pure galakrond is a win fast deck.
---
Fuck bg and fuck shaman. I am back to RuneScape!  Jk

It's so funny that the new demon that gains stats when your hero takes damage has anti synergy with Mal'ganis (your hero is immune)

Hearthstone's design ethos really doesn't open a potential pauper format to be particularly interesting. Control and combo tools are almost never printed at common for example.
---
Other formats like Commander and Brawl would be difficult to replicate since ramp, a crucial part of both formats, is almost completely limited to only one class in this game, mana is capped at ten, and the build restrictions in Standard and Wild constructed are already pretty intense. Sure, Team 5 could change a few rules for this Hearthstone "Captian" format, but such would make it's rules much more dissimilar to the main game than Commander is to regular magic.
---
Hearthstone could of course use more modes of play though, but looking to MtG would probably be the worse place to look for them unless its a best of three constructed mode.
---
I don't think ban lists are a great solution for either. The primary benifit of Hearthstone being willing to leaning into being a digital card game is Team 5 doesn't need to.
---
Card changes already do take place on Wild cards. It's just that there's enough of them at this point that no strategy, outside of very particular circumstances, is free from potentially being hard countered by neutral tech options.
---
Job's done.
---
Megasaur is the real problem with murlocs - if they were the poison tribe, mechs had divine shield,  beasts have lots of Simmons+buffs, and demons just got to get really big the balance might be more even overall but megasaur just fucks the meta so hard.
---
r/murderedbywords
---
Man I wish I knew what card this flavor text was from!
---
Who could have known that a class card would be stronger than a neutral card.
---
Probably the last quest. I got 7 or 8 DoD packs before these events, although I believe one was for picking the Rust Buckets for the battlegrounds showdown.
---
That's just the way it works. You're getting 4 commons per pack on average and there aren't that many in the set, so you will start accumulating duplicates very quickly.

10/12/12 Dragon | Battlecry: Destroy all other minions and discard your hand.  
---
If I'm reading it correctly it's possible for your team to have more than one tribe. So its likely that the no tribe ones still qualified for some other tribe but they just happened to have two non tribe. I'm guessing lightfangs.
---
The twist is it‚Äôs just quest shudderwok shaman.
---
I wouldn't get coaching there are plenty of streams on twitch and YouTube videos that use basically that exact deck. Watching some of those can help you better understand the deck and how to play it better. After watching those and practicing you'll be set.
---
What joke is this?
---
Could flappy bird possibly make a cut in this deck? It seems strong and has synergy with other cards.
---
Yeah.... I don't think we've had it before where in consecutive days one class' win rate increases and literally every other class losses win rate...
---
Can't even use the "it's not power creep if it improves a bad card!" excuse as Twin Emperor Vek'lor was an auto-include in every C'Thun deck.
---
Better buff evolve, shaman is unplayable. Can‚Äôt evolve your 5 mana 10/12 worth of taunt on curve
---

---
That version isn‚Äôt close to touching how broken Saronite was with Zola and Grumble, it‚Äôs like a joke to suggest it.
---
HoLLY ShIt arE yOu SAyIng ReMOval EXiStS iN OthEr ClAsSeS??
---
Thank you for the helpful info! What were the new sets just released and what are the oldest sets in standard rn that will rotate when new sets come out?
---
Its unnecessary and inconsistent. It's winrate was 5% lower the last time I checked. If you want 4 8/8s then just run a draw package and shudderwock
---
Its so inconsistent that in the mirror (I played the better pure galakrond deck) I only saw shamans fumbling around with lackeys on turn 9, no galakrond. It gets stomped by galakrond + draw cards, rogue and by aggro (I've had many close shaves against aggro decks that missing turn 1 and having 1 less card in hand would have been a big deal)
---
Rumour has it that it will be announced on Monday and will be rolled out on Tuesday, that‚Äôs just a rumour though.
---
just log out and back in and all should be fine
---
And see, that‚Äôs more comparable to 6 mana twilight drake with 12-16 hp, and that card never saw play in quest shaman because of how busted the other cards are with that quest.
---
Oh. Glad he slept a few times since Tuesday lol
---
I think the person who jumps on a dog pile of someone already getting a shit ton of negative comments, just to stick their own shitty personal attack in, is worse tbh. 
---
I'm talking about you if that wasn't clear.
---
blizzard said on Twitter about 4 days ago that is was a bug and they have a hotfix coming but still nothing. so I'm starting to think it's intended or they decided to leave it
---
To be fair, it makes sense for healing effects to come at a premium in neutral, since it's very much a thing that not all classes are supposed to be good at (e.g., Rogues). Putting efficient taunts on the board is something that is more *in flavor* for some classes, but it's not something any class is meant to be uniquely bad at - in fact, the best taunts are very often neutrals.
---
An expansion lasts for about 4 month. The most recent one is decent of Dragons and the one that will be leaving in the next couple of months is The WitchWood. But in all honesty most decks are mainly made from cards this expansion
---
You mean your opponent concedes
---
You've got like 80 comments in this thread, trulyba God tier troll
---
I literally gave examples of when mutate and evolve saw play and weren't broken.
---
Which app is this?
---
Bolivia Firefly? Something like that.
---
She‚Äôs good, but not critical. I‚Äôd throw in a twilight drake, or another elusive wyrm
---
I'm pretty in favour of anti-cerclejerking, but you've got to do better than that. This sub is always ready to cry and hate any class that is dominating the meta, and I heard rumours that maybe there's not been a class as dominant as Shaman is right now. 
---
So all in all
---
Anti circle jerk: 8/10. 
---
Appropriate levels of salt: 3/10 (could use a bit more dignity). 
---
Actually being as clever as you feel: 1/10. 
---
Over all 4/10. Your heart is in the right place but you really have work on your content.
---
It‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt spend $60 every quarter of that game, or every 5 minutes of that movie you saw. The barrier to entry is much higher in this game, so it is expected that playing would lessen that.
---
They're saying that Plague of Flames is situational, while Dragon's Pack is consistently strong.
---
Weird insults btw.
---
I don't think anyone mentioned swapping them. They're saying the mentioned cards are a consideration for dealing with wolves...
---
Would be completely useless then, there are other ways to nerf without taking away core mechanics
---
Veklor dies to that aswell
---
See. This is why I hate Alexstrasza as a card. It's the new Yogg.
---
Losing? Just throw her down and hope RNG will take the wheel and give you an out.
---
This and puzzle box are the two cards I hate more than anything in standard right now. Fault Shaman all you want, at least you know how they are going to beat your head in. Alex just steals wins and it feels like utter shit to lose too just because "oh well they had it in hand, guess I was outplayed/s"
---
Thank you :)
---
I think it's pretty optimized, but some things I might consider would be swapping out; Brightwing and Kaahrj for [[Twilight Acolyte]]s; putting in [[Bwonsamdi, the Dead]] with [[Shadowbomber]]s for extra finishing potential besides Leeroy when you're in topdeck mode, and perhaps the Pirate/Patches package since it works so well with Amalgam and Keleseth
---
Also, there's always Eater of Secrets (Secret Mage is still the best deck), and I honestly think that [[Kobold Stickyfingers]] is a hot af tech rn, especially given all the Tyrions off of Zeph, Galakrond claws, and Aluneths to boot.
---
That's odd. I had the opposite happen. It was doubling up my basic cards until I had 6 copies of them all. Relogged and it reset though.

Yeah, I  figure that Galakron with Talanji would be quite decent board flood, but then again having both card and having the handsize is a problem if you are struggling to stay alive.

They dont show the wild packs or adventures at all in app
---
Two minions sounds too much then. How about we change it to a minion instead? Just the one.
---
I wasn‚Äôt talking about Battlegrounds, I was talking about the main game. And because battlegrounds is a mode, and not a different game, it still carries that expectation, despite the lack of a real barrier to entry. I agree with you on some level, but when a player is choosing which game mode to play, they should never ask the question ‚Äúwould I rather get rewarded for my time, or have fun?‚Äù
---
But they can use highlander cards unlike Gala. There are neutral cards available to them they can build around, but Invoke only is available to 5 classes, so the other classes can‚Äôt make use of a few neutral cards.
---
Bolvar Fordragon.
---
I'm not saying Raza was fun in the machine gun priest, however, I used him in an inspire highlander deck with nexus champion saraad and confessor Paletress a few years ago. Raza was very fun in that deck. I still want Shaman in its current state to disappear just like I wanted machine gun priest to disappear when it was meta. It's all about which cards deserve a nerf and need it. I think Raza got shafted.
---
Yeah but then one 5/6 sounds like it's not enough for an invoke card... What if we made it a 7/7?
---
Except it wasn‚Äôt lol shaman was.
---
Lightforged Paladin is OP brother..currently at a 65% WR through 20 games. I coasted to rank 15 with it.
---
Nice
---
Current Rogue have a good amount of pressure, especially deathrattle package. Once Kangor option is gone, Paly just need to hope Flik is not in hand.
---
They raise the power level towards the end of the year, so you don't just buy the first expansion and just play with that.
---
That's why Kobolds was so fucked, it had to compete with KotFT.
---
Only thing that makes me doubt myself here is Rastakhan's. WTF was that entire expac?
---
It genuinely isn't power creep, though:
---
1. Elemental synergy of "played last turn" doesn't work with Invocation of Frost.
---
2. Glacial Shard has its effect no matter what, whereas Invocation of Frost only gets the 2/1 (with Rush) if you have a Galakrond.
---
i.e. If you were playing Elemental Shaman, you would run Glacial Shard instead.
---
The reason people didn't immediately scream OP is two fold.
---
1. We were excited by the new set and the prospect of Evolve Shaman finally exiting standard (again) and EVERY class was getting powercreeped cards. Playing spot the OP card in a set of OP cards isn't exactly easy.
---
2. This card effect hinged on how good the Invoke cards and Shaman's Galakrond was. Iirc, this card was spoiled before Shaman's Galakrond, the previous iterations were very low Tempo (Priest being the first and the worst) and the Invokers we saw were the Taunt and the 2/2. By the time we finally saw Shaman's Galakrond this card was in the back of everyone's mind because we were too busy gushing over all the other strong cards in the set that didn't rely on Galakrond. Synergy cards like this are often undervalued in a set compared to stand alone cards and their strength isn't apparent until we actually get to play with them.
---
Thereeeee will be paaaiiiinnn.
---
So much pain.
---
Gotta love how Priest is one of the few classes that has Dragons as a classic core identity in the past, so for the one dragon expansion we get some neutral tier dragon synergy cards. The devs has always loved giving Priest janky filler since they don't know if Priest cards will ever be good, but I had some hope they would be able to handle the most basic of archetypes with Dragon Priest. Play stats on curve, heal those stats, and you're done, good job you've made Dragon Priest.
---
Fire Fly, in case anyone was struggling to remember which card AlexAverage was referring to, like I was.
---
This powercreep is bullshit, blizzard is clearly trying to force is to buy packs to make our decks stay relevant in the current meta.
---
And can be counterspelled, strictly worse imo.
---
idk, Rogue is also super obnoxious
---
To be fair:
---
a) you're playing as dragon hunter, an archetype that has zero business competing with legitimate tier 1 decks. The fact the premiere EVIL deck is beating you isn't something that should shocking or worthy of concern, and

b) he playing a fully invoked Galankrond literally the 3rd earliest possible turn, given he went 2nd. He had a very good draw. I personally lost to 2 hunters tonight that went 100% pure face because galakrond shaman has 0 maindeck heal. Your opponent is at 20 health pre-Galakrond, so you quite clearly mis-prioritized your actions in the 8 turns leading up to this moment.
---
I'm not defending G-Shaman or saying it shouldn't be nerfed. I personally went from 19 to 4 in one night with minimal effort. It does need to be nerfed. But there are ways to build a deck where you're &gt; 50% to G-shaman and roughly 50%-ish to the rest of the field. Play G-shaman or play a counter deck. Or, you know, bitch about the game while losing. I'll go ahead and continue to get free wins.
---
I don't understand, what game is this? Those are some strange shaman cards..
---
Personally I prefer a midrange/tempo meta
---
I mean, quest druid has had 5 Mana 10/10 rush for a while now and is hasn't destroyed the game.  This card isn't single-handedly wrecking shaman, it's the sum of many things
---
Double savage roar isnt cool
---
If the devs don't want some classes to use taunt, why do they print extremely powerful neutral taunts on such a consistent basis? That's my point - some classes have a *flavor* connection to taunt and get more taunt-related class cards as a result, but neutral taunts aren't balanced to be bad compared to the class-specific ones. Twin Emperor was balanced to be VERY powerful when active. It was a major pull toward playing C'Thun decks. Dragon's Pack isn't way better because it's a Shaman card and neutral taunts aren't allowed to be as efficient as Shaman taunts; it's way better because it's just a way more powerful card.
---
Played one more match today, same thing happened. Time to retreat to the battlegrounds.
---
:D
---
Yeah but invoking galakrond is better than that
---
Scrap board though, had he not wasted his mana Black Knight would have been miles better to what he played. Zephrys just teaching OP good plays.
---
5 mana 3/3 is not well stated... A 5 mana 3/3 with no rush and summoning a single 2/1 is also dog shit and strictly worse then the 4 mana 2/2 rush.
---
Yeah exactly. I agree. Priests invoke is probably the most disappointing of all.
---
I think random Priest spells would be better. You'll at least get stuff that's proactive like Thoughsteal and Mass Resurrection.
---
It was never an okay card. No matter how much you want to try and mind fuck yourself into believing its power creep this card was utter garbage from the moment it touched the game.

---
I think firebat was right when he said "oh no, i have to play good cards in my deck to make this good card better" 
---
Normally you are forced to include some not so powerful stuff so that your legendary or quest works
---
Anybody else didn't recieve the usual notification about nerfed cards? (Glinda, Snipsnap, Bells) cause i didn't and found out reading patch notes, seems like something is wrong ü§î
---
Nice primalfin fix, murlocs are a little bit weaker now, but they are still very nice. I can also givevsome advices about battlegrounds or help to bust mmr, just message me for more information
---
His arms look so tiny
---
Most of the stats seem pretty useless. I'd like to see win rate and average finishing position for each hero.
---
that fucks the "lore" of the cards, and removing Rush from the 2/1s would be a huge nerf
---
So I'm ok with the nerf however there is a thought I have. If a nerf in Galakrond's HP is to happen how the dust reward is going to work since the card is uncraftable? I mean a card is being nerfed so full dust value should be reimbursed or am I wrong?
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
does it even need to be epic? Lets make it common so people might consider including one in their decks.
---
I have 9.3 priest wins and I think priest is fine right now, so that invalidates your opinion.
---
I haven't played during that time but i imagined that Zap-o-matic was played a ton in aggro shaman, it's one of the best aggressive 2 drops in the game imo. Can you elaborate why it wasn't played during its time in standard?
---
The numbers add up to more than 100% for a reason.
---
BOW TO THE MASTER RACE THAT IS THESE RETARDED FISH PEOPLE
---
I've just played since beta and personally don't remember seeing it in ranked but I could be wrong.
---
This is a problem as well, they are TAKING AWAY from Priest, not giving it anything to work. If ANYTHING else but DS combo were created that work, people just wouldn't play that. Like people right now just played Galakrond Priest even after knowing it is shit because we wanted something, ANYTHING, new.
---

But it's a 100% winrate deck based on a sample of one game.
---
I don't have any experience with this card honestly, I got her from the faceless lackey in that image. But I think to reduce the cost of a discovered card is not that big of a deal and in most cases you only get to benefit once.
---
Or just play  the swapper guy with Dinomancy
---
Well you can play a stealweaponsilencehex shaman to beat it
---
And the opponent pet-rified.
---
Even Zetalot said he had faith, but he honestly tought he might be mistaken and felt weak. Kripp said the same, there was a post here with everyone's take and I read all the Priest ones and most people even said it was strong because of the effect being only for the opponent... poor souls haven't played priest in so much they tought it was like every other class, getting to keep a board after a turn.
---
Wait for Tuesday (or Thursday) balance changes. There are some cards that are hyper-meta used in many many decks and archetypes but just wait 5 more days. Though if you play enough, then it would be pretty obvious what neutral cards are used everywhere. 
---
[https://hsreplay.net/cards/#sortBy=includedPopularity](https://hsreplay.net/cards/#sortBy=includedPopularity)
---
It's so narrow-minded when people can only fathom the current meta with the current Galakrond Shaman in its current state of power.
---
Use some critical thinking:
---
1. Galakrond Shaman is going to get nerfed.
---
2. Hearthstone can easily add future Elemental synergies.
---
3. Invocation of Frost can *only* be used to high effectiveness in a Galakrond decklist.
---
All three make it pretty clear that Invocation of Frost isn't simply better and completely outclasses Glacial Shard.
---
Is it better in a Galakrond Shaman list? Yeah. Duh, it would be a useless card if it weren't!
---
But in literally *any other decklist* you would pick Glacial Shard every time.
---
So unless you think Galakrond is the alpha-and-omega of Shaman for the rest of Hearthstone, consider that Glacial Shard isn't being made simply obsolete - and thus isn't being power crept out of existence.
---
The problem is, sometimes, the complaint are justified.
---
About as butt hurt as someone who can't even make an argument, just use meme speak and then down vote when they are called out.
---
What about what I said don't you agree with? I would love for you to explain why my way of thinking is wrong.
---
What are your thoughts on hailmary cards?
---
That was never originally stated. Stop with the fake news. In the past it worked with every expansion.
---
Yo dawg pretty sure Thrall stole that quote from someone else, can't quite remember the source but yeah definitely read that somewhere.
---
Eh, while Priest right now does deserve a buff, in general I like playing against Priest the least out of all classes.
---
Playing against strong priest decks feels like "if you play A they'll blow you out with x, if you play B they'll blow you out with y and if you play a slow game they'll eventually combo-kill you." Purely rationally speaking, it's balanced and I have better and worse options, but emotionally speaking, it feels like I have to pick in which way I want to hurt myself. And I really don't like getting my stuff mind controlled.
---
Plus whichever way I choose, Priest is often there to emote if he happens to have the right answer. Yeah, blowing me out with your answer card makes you feel really clever, but if I had picked the other option and if you'd have happened to have the answer for that, then you'd have felt smug too and you'd been emoting too.
---
Again, I do understand that there are better and worse plays against Priest and I do understand that right now Priest needs buffs. I also understand that other people may have different preferences than I. But I, personally, really don't like playing against strong priest decks.
---
So who's the real source here ?

If everything else fails try to launch the battlenet by right clicking and selecting "run as administrator".

Playing Priest is unplayable.

I wouldn't recommend crafting cards like Shirvalla sind Myra's when the rotate out in a few months.

I didnt see Someone else had already posted a similar thing srry

Oh god..oh jesus god almighty!

3/3 stats
---
Blizzard: we're going to Hall of Fame all mill deck support because they're not fun
---
also Blizzard: keeps printing Pirate Warrior support, one of the most hated decks ever
---
I think the odds of getting the right cards for the specific situation are so low that the card often just is a bunch of stats as a reward for running a highlander list. Which is fine.
---
When you do get the right card(s) to help you swing the tides in a game you have all but lost it creates a moment exciting enough for you to want to make a reddit post about it. It's clear hearthstone wants these moments to be there, I'd even go as far as they fine tune some their cards to have a very small chance of doing something insane, so the gamble feels extra rewarding when you do risk it.
---
So working as intended.

---
Same here, fuck this game until shaman gets nerfed. I am just afraid that even after nerfs it will still dominate considering how utterly broken shaman is right now. Played against 8 drooling shaman abusers in a row day ago, couple even BM after summoning galakrond or shudderwock into a board full of 8/8s and 6/6s. Needlessly said I am done with hearthstone for now, and probably for a very long time if they dont do any drastic changes to this insanely broken deck and the 5/4 rush corruptor. Fuck that and fuck anyone who abuses the deck.
---
Ok, boomer.
---
Your hand gets clogged with them. Like, really hard. And there is a lot of suboptimal stuff in the minion pool. Like Lightwell with its 0/5 statline and  abysmal healing at the start of your turn. Or a 5/8 Elemental for 5 that can't attack when it is damaged. 
---
Or that 6/5 that summons a random deathrattle from your hand. 
---
Multiple 2/1s and 2/2s with synergies to card that aren't in standard anymore. Even if you get a Talanji she tends to be underhwelming because the stuff that lands in your hand is just not threatening. At all.
---
No his voiceline costs 1 mana. 
---
Fun fact. Blizzard decided evil heckler should be 0 mana without a voiceline. They had no idea how to make the voiceline. That was untill a drunk designer yelled " You smell like a lepper gnome"and "Your mother was a murlock" that made the desinger get an idea to create that voiceline for 5 mana. Since it was amazing
---
Do you even know what reimbursed means? It means to get back the money you paid. You didn't pay anything for it, so you don't get anything back.
---
Try other classes,since youre 'newish'. I started playing with rogue  too as a begginer i really liked it, but then i tried hunter, warrior shaman, all classes, and i 'felt in love' with Druid. Good luck.
---
I actually beat a Galakrond Shaman recently. He sent me a friend request to call me the luckiest PoS on earth and immediately blocked me afterwards.
---
I don‚Äòt know whether to feel like i‚Äòve won or lost.
---
RNG is the most interesting discussion in this game by far as it's so personal on how much of it you like. A really good example of this is a video by Joseph Anderson, where he goes as far as suggesting using the video game format to influence your mulligan to always have playable cards in the early game.
---
If you ask me, there's no right answer. I both love and hate this game for it. It creates great moments of just pure luck, and moments of getting rewarded for playing to your 5% outs. On the other hand it feels awful to play everything correctly and still lose to that 5%. It's give and take.
---
Though innervate did also give 2 maan, so it was a 2 mana 4/5 as oppose to a 3 mana 4/5
---
Wow, ite a tier s, really good deck.Glad it should be getting nerfed very soon, most likely tommorow.
---
I understand that shaman has been an issue for a while now, but it has been confirmed things are happening
---
This same guy, just yesterday, posted a screen shot of log-in issues.
---
No you're missing the point. You can't say something is poorly statted when it is a 5 mana 7/5 whenever it is played. The point is not that the invokes make it a good card, simply that it is always a good card. If it was a 5 3/3 deal 4 damage I'd agree with you, but it isn't. It's all stats.
---
Not literally but technically it does since you must invoke first to upgrade Galakrond
---
Hi, I'm a rogue player and yes rogue is pretty good right now.Most would argue that the best rogue deck is deathrattle, but you can stick to a tempo rogue.If you want to main rogue, Edwin is a necessity but for now you can switch in a questing instead.For now you can run a galakrond package, though you would have to spend 800 dust for 2 umbral slickers, it would be good enough.
---
It doesn‚Äôt even matter!!!
---
Ah, my mistake.
---
Have you tried looking up hearthpwn they have a section for budget decks. In my first year playing I stuck with hunter try an play other classes just to get a feel of what you may shift too once your pool of cards grow
---
Truesilver Champion and Elven Archer is still an OTK from 30 health.
---
Rogue is possibly the best class right now. But Id wait till after the nerfs that go live sometime this week.
---
Is the mech boi motivated?
---
Yes? My point still stands. The 'side effect' of the 4 mana 2/5 is one of the major points in the DR Rogue deck (with Anka being a smaller point for when that misses). It's the equivalent of saying that using Dirty Rat just to stop the side effect of a 6 mana 4/6 is bad.
---
There are quite a few cards and things which need some changes. Shaman is just the stand out class at the moment.
---
For LiiiIIIiiiiiIIFe and maybe three more months.
---
How did you get good at Arena?
---
Oh the new resurgence of aggro face hunter is giving me ptsd
---
I'm a warrior main so it was instant golden craft for me, but I'll have a look to see what could be a possible replacement
---
I'd pay one mana for a good booty
---
So, I'm personally waiting to see how Shaman nerfs end up playing out. I've been playing a rez/deathrattle/quest priest variant with some success (I know that's a lot). But deathrattle and rez synergize pretty heavily so it's not been that bad except against the sheer power of shamans to generate a board off 1-2 cards multiple times. Against aggro, I try my best to hard mulligan (hard with quest) for Zilliax. Zilliax on 4 (with coin) or 5 into Pyscho-Pomp almost always nets me a win against warrior and hunter. I'm also a big fan of Convincing Infiltrator on 5 and Pyscho-Pomp/Shadowy Figure on 6. Copying the reborn makes it very hard for most classes (again, excepting shaman) to reestablish board control.
---
Sometimes a piloted Shredder. ok
---
mutate costs 1 mana, full invoked gala gives two 6/6 inc. Balancing team at it's finest
---
if you play waxadread you do something wrong
---
The fact that you mention candles means that you havent played against the deck where this card is broken in.
---
and worse then flashheal or binding heal priest already has,or light of naruu(less healing but gives a minion) or even regenerate
---
What if at the start of every turn you could pay a dollar to get the ability to Discover the next card you'll draw!
---
I forgot to replace korkron in this deck with warmaster  Voone, that card is sick  if you copy some buffed scions or a Alex and deathwing
---
It's pretty clear that you played against bad builds, because good ones don't run Waxadred. Even on Day 1 it was obvious that Waxadred is not good in those decks.
---
Early they've played Mechanical Whelps, now they've switched to Anubisath Warbringer. Here are some examples of the latest builds:
---
https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/anubisath-rogue-13-legend-farab-descent-of-dragons/
---
https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/anubisath-rogue-2-legend-j_alexander-descent/
---
https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/anubisath-deathrattle-rogue-3-legend-cptnkitty-descent/
---
I would change for: "Can't be targeted on your turn" disabling Lackey
---
Yes it's a problem. You are playing against the waxadred meme deck. The actual check uses this card on anubisath warlord then runs you over with high statted deckhands and leeroy to pretty much kill you entirely from hand for 30
---
Can't really find a good replacement, but if you like warrior then I'd say it's a safe craft imo
---
priest has gotten 1ok card this set with the mindflayer legendary,and its not great at all but its not the trash rest is atleast.
---
I feel like this card is literally carrying the deathrattle archetype at the moment. Blizz made deathrattle a rogue class identity but the archetype has never gotten the right tools or support to make it viable. My concern is it will likely go back to the dumpster if this gets nerfed. Also, it isn't exactly unfun to play against in the sense that it can still be countered and played around.
---
The tracker counts if you have two or more minions of that type if you win. So if you have 2 mechs, 2 murlocs and 2 beasts on board when you win, it triple counts.
---
highlander mage can deal with anything shaman throws out tbh, I think people are sleeping on this deck right now because shaman has more splashy combos, but highlander mage beats shaman while consistently beating basically everything else
---
It really does feel like it's in a complete league of it's own and unfortunately 99% of hearthstone players netdeck the best deck so you just play against the same list and opener every time.
---
I honestly just started playing casual mode and conceding instantly to every Shaman it's not worth playing that frusterating game and if they hit their double invoker on turn 5-7 it's just over at that point IMO.
---
I dont even know how they'd go about nerfing the deck it has so many just completely absurd parts that come together to form an abomination of card game balance.
---
The most egregious is turn 1 Glacial Shard with Rush, AND invoke.. It was playable without rush, and it has invoke as cherry on top.
---
Looks like the new Barnes
---
I am really interested in which cards are rotating out. Could you maybe post a link where I can find more info?
---
I'll take your word for it , any bad match ups with this deck ? ( I mean like the worst possible ones)
---
yeah,evry class should have some kind of reliable draw,taunts,removal etc.
---
But how strong and how they work should be different for classes.
---
Basically playing a lot over the years
---
you got a list for dragon mindblast?
---
Yup, I appreciate it. Pretty cool, powerful cards. I'm waiting for shaman nerf before I try standard again
---
Yes as clearly demonstrated by mind blast.
---
The amount of board clears Warlock has right now would have been OP on any other metagame, but it's not enough right now.
---
Albatross
---
I didn't even know it worked that way. I updated the info.
---
Welcome to hearthstones problem when they make a good idea like discover or Rush.
---
They just throw that shit on everything in a new sets because they have trouble coming up with new evergreen mechanics.
---
It's a rogue card, so expect it to get trashed probably with random few more with it
---

Honestly, I think making it summon four would make it more of a pack. Clearly to 5/6's are just weak
---
No fuck that. I'm sick and tired of combo priest being the only viable deck for years. If they remove it they will finally have to release something actually good for priest, even if it'll take a few rotations.
---
So damn busted.
---
Nice photoshop
---
I‚Äôm all for hof‚Äôing inner fire tho, the thing is we have cards like radiance which are unusable

you could face someone with 6 divine shield poisonous murlocs.

---
Started playing in boomsday and even after dropping 300 or so dollars i still mostly can only play warlock, due to only being able to afford 1-2 decks and expansion
---
Not sure if anub rogue is a fully aggro deck, kinda feel like it‚Äôs midrange combo, but the current Pirate warrior feels too RNG as the opponent as fighting them is not hard unless they get lucky and turn 1/2 a pirate into 2/2 pirate free from hand and a patches yeeting out from deck. 
---
Currently there is Max 5 mana cheat with 3 cards on turn 1, prob my bad luck but I lost to that 3 times cuz all of my clear is at least 3 mana :/
---
how to get dislikes
---
step 1: play galakrond/quest shaman
---
step 2: post on reddit that you play these decks
---
step 3: ???
---
step 4: profit
---
Any reason to not run both Welps and Warbringers? I'm running both with only deckhands ad leeroy as chargers and it's doing really great. Also got Octosari for refill should the game go too long and while it's awkward when apothecary draws into it the big rnetacle Boi has served me well.
---
This is the worst idea
---
So which one did you pick
---
Upcoming nerf to faceless? Where is this announcement? Or you still guessing?
---
Deck has best possible opening hand, people somehow shocked its strong. More at 11
---
Aaah.

Try Shrivallah OTK pally. 52% wr overall, currently going 7-1 against shamans.

The murloc
---
Shaman: The meta can be whatever I want.
---
Wow Reddit upvotes. The best justification for your opinion. Also 26 now.
---
It‚Äôs definitely not a deck flaw, it‚Äôs just a really strange time in the meta with 2-3 decks being so powerful. I did run across a rogue playing a similar deck to yours but he teched in magic carpet and it worked super well with the lackeys. I would honestly keep galakrond if I were you as cards costing zero in a miracle deck is insanely powerful. And I was offering to help for free just if you ever need a second opinion in general :)
---
that means literally nothing
---
Imagine galakrond shaman actually playing quest, more decks could have a chance.
---
 After the first day people just dropped the quest package because with the quest package you are slower and a handful of decks can beat you by pressuring you or you getting bad cards. The non quest version which is the best deck right now is beaten by holy wrath paladin, that's it.
---
That's a pretty common meme on twitch chat AFAIK
---
Don‚Äôt you dare take my hideous kobold child away from me!
---
I mean priest as in the oldest archetypes, before raza priest was even created. Includes stuff like shadow priest (cuz the hero card and raza were yet to be printed) where you can‚Äôt just constantly generate cards, you had to conserve resources since ur not RNGing your way out of a bad situation if you already spent your removal cards earlier, thus making it a slower meta where all your decisions matter in the long run.
---
Pirate totem dragon
---
Yes
---
It's still a 4 Mana that draws a specific card which has to have a silence used on it, which is debilitating to you. There's also a good chance that they have necrium blade ready, which can only be countered by weapon removal, which is useless against shaman.
---
Also Spiritbomb + Arcane blast. Double unplayable.
---
i don't know man, 3 mana dagger that triggers the deathrattle, hit  into turn 4 coin this pull anubisath
---
it's deadly against slow decks
---
Hows rez priest this expac? RoS and SoU gave a lot of support to the deck and it was bordering on T2. But the fact that DoD gave literally zero support was pathetic. 
---
Rez is the one thing left priest has. And after mass resurrection rotates out the deck is dead.
---
Agree, except when they drop a 1/2 pirate into free 4/4 worth of stats and a patches coming out of their deck in wild on turn 1 kek
---
Silence...
---
That's why I've said one of the strongest, but I think that those two were really comparable. Mage had best removals / burn cards, but Rogue had (and still has, but not to the same extent) the strongest tempo options. And as we all know, tempo is king for a while now.
---
Mage was clearly dominating back in the Beta when Pyro costed 8, Blizzard 5 and Nova 2 (yeah). But I'm not even counting that.
---
I'm just shocked something so obviously problematic, made it past the testers.  This isn't a bug it's just a very basic broken deck.
---
Either they hand wave tester feedback or they barely test because there is no way it would be missed by anyone that knows how to play this game.
---
Makes you feel icky
---
/r/technicallythetruth
---
Im not getting my hopes up for any buffs this week. What i would like to see is the invoke for Galakrond giving a random priest minion that costs 1 less.

Yeah that meta is also nice

The 5 mana 3/3 invokes twice. So it is 5 mana, summon a 3/3, deal 4 damage to minions or gain +4/+2, advance galakrond towards final form of 2 8/8s with rush and a 5/2 weapon.
---
Also, the 4 mana is a 2/2, so it is realistically a 4/3, not a 4/4.
---
"With decent stats"
---
Shamanstone heroes of Galakrond
---
How the fuck is it 40%. That seems way out of proportion.
---
Year of the Shaman
---
So faceless manipulator but gain rush?
---
^^^SHHHHHH
---
hoes mad
---
Yeahh, good thing blizzard will nerf it that to 5 mana /s
---
It'll most likely be nerfed with the up-coming changes to shaman anyway.
---
i will definitely wait a couple of days for the nerf, they may also buff some other classes.. right?
---
It's not really the high-stat or high-value cards that are causing the problem. Its the high-tempo cards that are either rush, cheat or draw effects (usually multiple in one). They can fix these cards one by one (Apoth, Ancharr, Stormhammer etc etc etc), but it solves nothing. 
---
There's a secondary wave of hyper-tempo cards and decks ready to take their place which are even faster and cheaper e.g, see hero-power/secret hunter or plain mech hunter that does not use any of these cards. And if Blizzard nerfs the secondary list, then guess what - Aggro Mech/Paladin-Paladin, Combo Priest, Murloc Shaman will just be back. 
---
While aggro is 'healthy' in making sure decks don't all go the way of control warrior vs Tess Rogue, there's something 'broken' at the core of Hearthstone's design where so far high tempo is the solution to every single meta and problem. You can design all the high-powered legendary 8-9-10 cost cards you want, but I'll just make sure I beat you by turn 7 / 6 minute mark.
---
Necrium vial is kinda like the Quest in Galakrond Shaman. Sometimes it does amazing things but you're generally better off running something else that wins you games more often.
---
Yeah no, I like RNG as much as the next guy, but I'm kinda tired of building my ENTIRE DECK around it. Kinda sick and tired of this or building my entire deck to pkay like face Hunter does.
---
Also, if this card was such an issue, we'd see it impacting the ranked ladder just as much as Shaman has. But yeah, let's nerf one of the few good cards Rogue got this expansion since we're looking at nerfs... /s
---
there are variations, i'd suggest the one with the dragon that gives you a 0 cost mana spell, 
---
basically if you are able to not be almost dead after galaxy you have a good chance of winnning
---
Nerf this to 5 mana, faceless corrupter to 4/3, galakrond shaman's hero power and the shaman invoke twice to 6 mana.
---
I got to rank 2 with rogue and now i'm losing every game against shaman so i quit playing until the nerfs
---
I understand galakromd shaman is too OP but you just used a couple of bad experiences you had to shame people for playing the video game the way they want to. You gotta be more positive!
---
Don't forget:
---
* the same old inner fire combo
---
* stealing your opponent's minions (often just to get its deathrattle)
---
* annoying constant resurrection - it's so so much fun having to defeat the same overstated taunt minions while you run out of resources
---
no need to nerf them, just buff the other stuff/change what is in the tavern. Murlocs having a win condition is fine, but theirs is so much easier to get than the others it is a problem.
---
Silverback + dinomancy got me to legend a couple times tho
---
Fucking up wild is intended so even wild players feel forced to buy packs
---
Not easily.
---
Crystalweaver is a great buff, especially with Bran.  But Battlemasters + Bran are almost required because of the HP levels they reach.  They can deal without Divine Shield, but Demons lose easily to poison.
---
I'm not saying that rogue wont be broken just because there are tech cards against it, just saying that the existence of these tech cards might reduce rogue's winrate. I agree that apothecary is a bit too strong and should be nerfed.
---
I was a Priest main, but deleted the game and didn't buy this expansion and I feel like I'm vindicated. I love the game but fuck them.
---
Also Ancharr. I love playing with that card, but man is it way too strong, even with just the limited and rather weak pool of pirates available in standard right now. It should really be a 3 mana 2/2, and it would still be really strong.
---
There are literally three separate comment chains this applies too already, and this is not a long thread. Don‚Äôt know what to tell you.
---
You should play gala shaman aswell then. Seeing how toxic you are
---
Cries in [[Mana Wyrm]]
---
Yeah, this is the thing people are ignoring really hard. Shaman is the only thing allowing this deck to exist, since shaman is completely unaffected by silence since they are all battlecry/rush, so those are completely dead cards against the majority of decks in play right now.
---
The biggest threat is a 3/4 necrium into this, but that the complete nuts draw, how many decks (pirate warrior etc) can you really beat on their perfect draw?
---

the message is fuck shaman
---
LOL! I play at work üòÇ
---
...if this is their turn 1, you are dead by turn three. Those aoe‚Äôs won‚Äôt see the light of day, and if they do, you‚Äôre left with single digits in terms of health.
---
Man for all the love and hate hearthstone gets I don't think anybody complains about the voicelines, so many rememberable lines. I fucking freaked out when I heard illidan played against malfurion the first time
---
Dragonrider is a slow card. You'll need to wait and see post-patch if the meta slows down enough for Dragonriderl, but not so much that the same buff-effect Warrior Galakrond/Scion overtakes Dragonrider Value. 
---
Chances are slim though. Both Embiggen Druid and Galakrond Warrior is likely to beat Paladin in the handbuff game with a lot less deck restrictions.
---
Good. Fuck aggro! &gt;:)
---
And only friendly minions
---
Cept its not fun to play and doesn't feel good.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs ‚ÄúCome, little brother!‚Äù
---
First triggered millenial, part of this cancerous baby-cry community.
---
The risks involved with playing Patches are still very much worth the rewards. Don't forget, while he's just a 1/1, summoning him from the deck is also taking out the worst card in it.
---
Link two of them because I read all of the comments here. I think you're just being a schmuck.
---
Breaking the game for anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to play shaman.
---
Right now running weapon removal is kind of pointless, but once Shaman is gone and there are  Rogues, Warriors and Paladins running the show, you can safely include Oozes in your lists and it Necrium blade won't be much of a problem, right?
---
Then just ask for it to be removed from the game instead of being worse than pack filler.
---
I totally haven't hit F5 99 times already today to see if it's been announced yet.
---
Feels like 2014 freeze mage complaints. The more things change, the more they stay the same.
---
This also requires you to draw it BEFORE the deathrattle card, or the combo is dead.
---
haha that's what I remember him saying
---
No. Team 5 wouldn't take the potential risk of creating a nearly as bad situation by buffing cards at the same time of nerfing them right now.
---
Too bad Cthun would pop in and interrupt it 90% of the time.
---
No they are not. There is actually a very limited subset of the basic/classic set.
---
Every card Zephrys offers is in Basic/Classic != Every Basic/Classic is in Zephrys pool.
---
Even among cards that can grant lethal and are not worse than other lethal cards for the same mana, some of them are missing i.e King Crush.
---
Loses to defile
---
At this point I‚Äôve just accepted that TCG balance is not the strong suit for this dev team.
---
They are very capable of using Hearthstones cards to make great single player content, and they seem quite capable of creating alternate modes.
---
But I just don‚Äôt see them really ever having success with the Standard TCG mode in Hearthstone. 
---
Nothing about Standard has been balanced or even remotely close lately. Why should we expect the upcoming changes to end with anything other than another bad meta?
---
It wasn't about bouncing minions, which is actually one of the Rogue's secondary themes, it was mostly about doing it en masse. According to Blizzard's Rogue identity, the class is not supposed to be good at "crowd control", it shouldn't have strong AoE options.
---
But like I've said, if they decide to enforce identity of one class, but not the other, that's not really the right way to do it.
---
Hey if I had the dust I'd craft other decks. It just so happens that most legendaries of Galakrond Shaman I already had. Since it was/is the strongest deck I decided to dust some golden epics and rares I had to craft the remaining pieces. 
---
The other decks that are meta are crazy expensive and require at least 5k additional dust to complete for me...
---
More like innervate innervate coin OGER
---
I've never heard of "Sunshine Hunter", and I hate Combo decks just as much. Secret Pally is again, more a case of Aggro-midrange than Midrange Control, since it relied on having a strong early curve to race your opponent.
---
I thought I heard Kripp say something along the lines that Warlock Galakrond was the weakest when played, but one of the strongest to have in deck.  A strong zoo deck that continually summons 1/1s that potentially has a large demon-summoning endgame?  Seems valid to me.
---
Also, it wouldn't be the first time a card was included in a deck even if it was never played.
---
Faceless is THE most OP card period, some games come down to who draws their copies of this first... Hell you can be shaman when you drop two of these guys back to back...
---
My all time favorite HS pasta. Still get a few people biting on this one every time.
---
He has 1 card left. He gets 10 health ahead and then runs out of steam. This is not near the top of the list of OP shit right now, IMO
---
Hey Rheytos, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "Petition". Calling a thread a petition is essentially a subtle request for agreement upvotes, and petition threads generally tend to be poor prompts for constructive discussion.
---
Brings a tear to my eye
---
I‚Äôm pretty new to hearthstone and I‚Äôm wondering how you get the overlay that shows what you and opponent have played.
---
He's not the best. He's the most polarizing. He's too inconsistent to be the best.
---
The reason Nefarian is stupid is the reason you state...IF you make it to late game, he's a sure bet to win. You actually need to screw up pretty hard or get wildly outplayed not to win if you get to the final four as Nefarian. He either needs to be removed from play or have his hero power changed to all minions.
---
The strongest heroes will remain the heroes with the strongest starts, because they're the ones that most consistently hit the final four. Brann, Curator, Yogg, Rafaam. Autopicks if you see them. Rat King can be pretty oppressive too, but he's inconsistent enough to be tier 2.
---
Yes...exactly. The Aggro strategy makes the game less fun because it takes literally no skill to play it.
---
How are you dealing 12 damage to deathwing?
---
Thanks for the response. Is it pretty common they leave brewmaster on the table?
---
One card shouldn't determine the entire game.

This archetype is so artificial that it hurts me on another level. Playing againt this deck is unfun, uninteractive and dealing with a 7/7 and anotger one coming in the place of a 2/5 is just as much bullshit as Shaman right now. There are a lot of sleeper cards which are completely busted in this set, it's beyond me, and it has nothing to do with dragons, you know, the core idea of the set, which is kind of interesting
---
malygeese?

No, I explained what I meant after typing that. I know reading is hard for most redditors but give it a try.

Anecdotal
---
&gt;It is skill based though
---
Reread my post. I never said it was devoid of any skill.
---
&gt;people just like to pretend it's not skill based because it makes them feel better being hard stuck at 6k or whatever
---
Or people like to pretend something is completely skill based because it adds value to a worthless time investment
---
HS BG severely lacks methods of skill expression &amp; the skill cap is effectively non-existent compared to other autobattlers, and completely non-existent compared to other strategy games where you have nearly unlimited decisions to make.

Wait, betrayal doesn't work that way, it just deals damage without trading.

Khadgar and Khadgar, Hagatha and Hagatha, Dr Boom and Dr boom and Dr Boom, and don't forget; Deathwing and Deathwing and Deathwing and Deathwing

It seems like face decks have a very good win rate vs all the shamans. I don't know why so many people are upset about shaman instead of going aggro decks.
---
Brode oversaw plenty of clown metas himself. Let's not re-write history here.
---
This is what I‚Äôm currently using at rank 3.! Some of the 2-ofs and 1-ofs can be switched up and Captain Greenskin, Sharkfin Fan, and Sulthraze are the semi-common inclusions I‚Äôm personally not running.  Restless Mummy consistently has some of the worst drawn stats in the deck on HSReplay but I‚Äôm not sure if that includes when it‚Äôs tutored off Town Crier.

so the excess damage continues to the left AND right? interesting
---
Control is strong: What this is boring. Those decks aren't REAL control. Infinite armor is so boring, I want to play stuff! Hero power and pass so boring. 
---
Mid-range is strong: LoL Curvestone. Let's see I have the 5 mana card so I'll play the 5 mana card. Wow so hard.
---
Aggro is strong: So toxic and non-interactive. "Me go face." Braindead decks, a bot could climb with this. 
---
That's this sub.
---
I agree that nefarian needs to be removed. I have a 100% winrate with him and i played like 17 games with him. The only other late game hero i can think of is George who gets countered by nefarian. Still i think that a skilled player can easily make it to top 4 with nefarian.
---
What about them?
---
I think the reason it's getting the hate it's getting is because it's like Barnes, if you draw it before the card it combos with you win the game. Having 2 of these with 2 deathrattles makes it more consistent. However what most people don't realize is the deck is as strong as a wet pool noodle by putting a silence in your deck. Sadly too many people can't tech against it with shamanstone functioning just fine even vs a silence.
---
And without aggression, decks would be able to be as greedy as they want. They also appeal to a sort of player who isn't you.
---
It's a wild game tho. Shaman isn't even broken in wild. It just looks like u wanted karma to me.
---
He has a 46% winrate against Shaman in the photo.  It‚Äôs literally his only bad matchup based on his sample.
---
The whole "if you're angry, sleep on it" virtue truly works wonders.
---
Why do you think it should be HoF‚Äôd?
---
Further, why would we need to HoF any minion to add Wizzbang? They added legendaries to make up for Sylvanas and Rag being removed, but I do not see it necessary to remove a legendary to justify adding another.
---
We are pretty terrible people
---
I've tried closing it, when I open it, it comes up with this again.
---
It pulls from the deck so they don‚Äôt lose any value.  They have plenty of invokes to upgrade Galakrond, they wont miss one.
---
Dragon Priest was the only deck I'd consciously thought of as 'Midrange Control.' I think it hit tier 1 briefly but never was the best deck.
---
I think there is nonpissible defence of Faceless Corruptor. I've never hated a card so much.
---
This looks more like a gift for the mod team than to the sub to be honest.
---
I had success in druid when all my cards were class cards. Was a fun game
---
I would actually say that its a mediocre deck which got lucky with the meta. In a meta that didnt degenerate, it wouldve been considered a mediocre deck, so thats what it truly is. And the thing is, while 50% is average win rate, in card games where a lot of players play actively bad decks like Quest Rogue and pre-patch Deathrattle Rogue, which drag down winrate, "average" is pretty much bad. 
---
It means there had to be many worse decks that get played, yes. Unfortunately, those decks were literal meme tier.
---
Its actually *extremely* uncommon. In recent times, the only class that managed to be sub-50% win rate on all decks was post-nerf Mage. And post-nerf mage was atrocious. Before that it was post-nerf Druid in Rastakhan. Because again, 50 isnt the baseline for a good deck, its the baseline for a *playable* deck.
---
I understand you are trying to make a point but 10 zephyrs would actually be awful for singleton.
---
I have never once in this thread said that the deck isn't overpowered, nor have I said that it doesn't need nerfed. I do think that it should NOT be nerfed into the ground though, which is what people are calling for. What I'd propose is make them 1/1 Rush instead of 2/1 rush, so that you get the same feel, but not such an excessive amount of value.
---
Rush in itself is a control mechanic. It's removal, which is core to the control mindset.
---
Bolvar Fordragon in the Goblins vs. Gnomes expansion.
---
There's actually 2 priest OTK's right now that are pretty reasonable. 
---
The problem is you'll never live past turn 7 or 8 to play them, because every priest card is garbage.
---
Yep.
---
Is this some kind of attack in shaman players or something? Cuz them bois have had enough hate lately you know...
---
We are the essence of magic!
---
It starts with a whelp, it was casted on either the left most or right most minion. And went one way down the line.
---
After they nerf shamen all of r hearthstone is going to complain about pirate warrior again.
---
Trashtalking Facebook Andy is beating a dead horse. Even though it usually results in him doing something rather nice to deflect criticism.
---
Faceless 3/4 at least and would be still played. I think the best is 4/4 at 6 mana or 5/4 at 7 mana. It remembers me when giggling was at 5 mana and was in every deck.
---
Shows the power level of the set.  These are by no means terrible cards just not good enough for the current crop of decks.
---
I may be wrong but o don't think this is op. Shaman is OP because it can swarm the board multiple times with 5/4, and then 4 8/8s almost two times before turn 10. it can't be countered because no boardclear can counter this that Many times. Not Even mage with golem+conjurer's calling could swarm like that.
---
Every shaman card allows battlecry-swarming, rouge has a Lot of flaws,like lack of regen and boardclear
---
1/1 Rush is a good idea, but the 8/8s should not have Rush. Gaining 32/32 worth of stats for 9 mana is fine on it's own, it doesn't also need to act as removal so Galakrond can be played whenever the Shaman pleases.
---
It's not just "Rogue draws really well" it's about the consistency and synergy the cards have and how oppressive they are in basically the first 5 turns of the game. The cost needs to be increased, or the battlecry needs to re-worked to something along the lines of Gral, or Mechanical Welp needs to be nerfed so that the deathrattle summons a Mechanical Dragon 7 mana 5/5. 
---
No other class comes close to the shenanigans Rogue can pull off with the ability to Draw up to 7 zero cost cards because of Galakrond/Toggwaggle.
---
Haha :) true
---
ƒ∞gor19#1440 EU trading 80 gold quest
---
11 mana 2/3 Battlecry: Deal 50 damage to your hero, if you survive, destroy the enemy hero.
---
Ummm.. What is this demon that deals 5 to your face? Pit Lord is a battlecry and Unlicensed Apothecary is in Wild so there should be no issue unless I'm forgetting something. Then again if you're playing this in Wild you have to accept the occasional lowroll.
---
Summoning two 1/1's is pretty damn powerful. Ever played Odd Paladin? No deck can continuosly clear your dudes and while Warlock doesn't have the same ability to buff the tokens it has other advantages from flooding the board. Try running two Sea Giants and Jumbo Imps and see how fast you can get an 8/8 on board. 
---
The Galakrond coming down should just be your finishing move after dominating the board and as a zoo deck you aim to finish opponents off sooner than that.
---
I feel like the Devs are trolling at this point, why would they give priest galakrond to get a random priest minion, where a good chunk of them require synergy to make them useful. Yes, thank you for giving me a 1/3 that I can't use because I can't heal anymore. They should've committed to making dragon priest instead of constantly printing 2-3 shit value priest cards that don't really fit anywhere
---
Even murzorond is total shit
---
With 1 reasonable source of aoe priest would be fine for me to meme albatross with
---
Mass hysteria is just rng
---
The new 3 mana aoe doesnt even kill a lot of 1 drops dealing only 2 damage
---
Shaman/warlock got all the decent aoe, priest is in a terrible state
---
Don't forgot that a couple MTG designers (can't remember their names) helped Team 5 with a lot of stuff near the end of Ben Brode's career at Blizzard. This year may have very well been the first we've seen of that.
---
Voodcaller -&gt; Sac Pact -&gt; Mal'ganis/Voidlord has also been around for a long ass time
---
Yup
---
Ahh yes, the good old drawing yshaarj before Barnes.
---
The Lich King is a recent phenomenon because the Scourge is a recent phenomenon. With the scourge having grown massively leading up to Wrath, it made sense at the time that not having a Lich King to command them would lead the scourge to rampage over the whole planet. No idea how strong the scourge‚Äôs numbers are as of the start of Shadowlands, or how the Helm of Domination‚Äôs destruction will affect the scourge and Azeroth as a whole, however.
---
I always get so excited when I can pull off cool turn 1 things but then get sad when all I have is 1 card left in my hand and have to rely on topdecks.
---
ALL minions
---
I'll get more creative when they expand the deck size to 32-34.
---
Did they imply they wanted to remove combo priest? Or create it?
---
Because right now there's 2 different priest OTK's that only require Fate Weaver for setup.
---
Aggro has to use their brains too, aggro has to think about if the trades they are making are favorable or not and such. Where you have to think about stretching your resources out and what not
---
I think it was Kibler that said the problem with priest is that our classic set is mostly shit. And they made it worse by HoFing Mind Blast.
---
Anub Rogue. Multiple +3/+3 buffs on charge minions.
---
Really? Been gone for a while and this is still the case?
---
but ppl already are rank 1 with this deck so it is consistent
---
Ok grammar nazi. That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt have any friend.
---
In my experience, you don't build up all that much random garbage, so talanji will only play your 4th cleric.
---
Why do you think they are getting hate?
---
Still dead to countless resurrect shenanigans.
---
the actual downside is that you don't get the benefit of trading first, then using this card or using this card to transform useless stuff both of which are actual uses for the card in its current state
---
I forgot about Dragon Priest. That was another deck I loved.
---
&gt; Faceless Corruptor
---
You're in a different argument with this one, though. Corrupter is just kinda dumb no matter what deck you're running, so long as you can make a creep turn 4.
---
&gt; I mean it's the only quest that is still run out of nine others that should clear things up on whether it's to strong.
---
I expect that if a Priest deck manages to emerge in the post-nerf meta it will run the quest. Priest Galakrond is **bad**. None of the invoke options feel remotely playable even post nerf because they trade way too much tempo for late game value in a meta that will absolutely be defined by aggro.
---
In contrast, quest priest gets a ton of value by healing face and taunts/deathrattles which work well against aggro. I've been having a decent time in my non-shaman matchups and I'm pretty sure I could consistently beat shaman if they lost just one of their tools. Unfortunately, invokes, faceless, dragon pack, galakrond, and shudder create more threats than I can generally remove.
---
Does BGs give golds or any kind of rewards?
---
You can still combo it out turn 4. And it should cost 1 more mana
---
Well I guess there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that and it was just me being weirdly attached to a stranger on the internet and appreciated the services he gave to a lot of people. I could argue why I disagree but not only have so many other done the same but I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre tired of replying to all of the comments.
---
Nice to know, thx
---
This card is at the same power level as Barnes for Rogue.
---
Probably because back in GvG when Spider Tank was relevant, it was about jamming as many good statted vanillas into your deck as possible. Nowdays, with the constant set rotation and Blizzard pushing for archtypes, a card can be a 3 mana 3/4 with an effect and not see play because it simply won't fit within the deck.
---
It's more that decks need to be more specialised rather than just have good stats on a curve.
---
Seems like a buff to me since I can now zurn 3 blade and turn 4 apothecary
---
Still waiting for a Fireball nerf since 2014
---
*wooosh*

This is exactly my point. Even paying 5 mana for a Giant is considered slow these days.
---
lmao fuckin got em
---
I think king burgurgle is to blame. Adds a power murloc for the 3/2  discover a murloc guy and bridges your early murlocs into late game murlocs beautifully. Either he needs to go or poisonous adapt
---
Couldn‚Äôt tell you for sure, I want to say around the 10th or so? That was the 3rd Megasaur I had time for, Poison -&gt; Shield -&gt; Windfury.
---
...what murloc card?
---
A. F. K.
---
It counts for your 3 wins for 10g
---
Icy veins has some good tips and general strategies for each hero and boss. Also goes over what card buckets are best as well as treasure ratings.
---

---
Because it draws the card and summons it essentially
---
It was the first time I didn't craft any cards because I know nerfs will be coming. So sad though, I had to play casual to complete my quests.
---
Thank you very much for all of the above!
---
Yeah, but you can still copy the 7/7, the Whelp, or Anka tokens. Almost lost to that today.

That message is "I'm playing Priest."
---
Yep, got alex 'd -&gt; bronze herald + deathwing'd when I otherwise had ez lethal. Feels so bad.
---
Sadly, I think Blizzard believes this kinda shit is what makes HS fun.
---
I used J Alexander's Warbringer list to hit legend last night, it feels really strong
---
Why does it matter what deck a person plays?
---
Ye the issue is there is stuff that needs removing
---
I mean giving waarlock 1/1 imps and shaman 2/1 rushes is just retardedly unbalanced
---
Rush needs to be removed from pretty much all shamans stuff
---
Apothecary has to go up at least 1 mana
---
And beyond this i think invoke with warrior is next...might be wrong, but smorc smorc smorc..
---
If they actually realeased better control tools.for classes that want it (namely priest) we might not even have this issue..
---
I was actually think gigfling inventor back to 5 mana could help the meta.. but in reality shaman would probably just smash us all with it
---
"I dont like the deck so clearly no one else could" go ahead and scream at my dad who loves big priest so much 5k out of 5.5k of his wins are with priest variants that are all resurrect based
---
I‚Äôve played the blowtorch dude a few times decent effect good stats
---
I'm not talking about invokes. I'm talking about the galakrond card Battle cry
---
buffs doesnt mean should be just set,could be rastakhan still for example or WW or any other set.
---
and for DoD priests set is terrible,it has 1decent card with mindflayer and 1ok in murozond in gimmicky priest toggwalge deck.
---
Priest set needs a buff(escpialyl crap like chronobreaker which is a worse abomination) or their galakrond invoke/hero power.(or just read thread on priest on frontpage)
---
And buffs in general should be done alot more,are alot of cool/interesting cards that were at best ok in ealry days(or straight up bad like shadowform) and have become worse due just general powercreep,or just were always understatted/overcosted.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
buffs should happen,to most of DoD no,others cards yes
---
I would have a temper issue is I freaked out Lmao I just get annoyed waiting a minute for granny to pick between 3 options every time I play
---
&gt;for only 1 deck in the meta.
---
According to [hsreplay](https://hsreplay.net/?hl=en) the top 4 classes are (in this order) Shaman, Hunter, warrior, and rogue. 3 of those four classes have a galakrond and all of those classes have an in class weapon and 3 out of four of the top decks run some form of weapon in the main deck (that isn't just galakrond)
---
So the weapon removal is far from just one deck in the meta
---
Yeah... what does "performance improvements" mean exactly?
---
Aren't wisps also for that 5 mana 5/4 card with Rush?
---
Yeah. But point is is that it should be about skill and deck vs. Deck statistics, not the rest of this crap I'm seeing. It's all about who has the best cards now, not who has the cards necessary to beat another. Given, legendaries are supposed to be better than average, I think it's crap that you need so many of the current ones to have a good deck. The only deck I've ever crafted up to this point that I play well is Treant/Token Druid, but then they gave us Goru, and it's back to Legendary Hunting
---
What the heck, really?! This is how the shop appears for me, she doesn't show up.

Deck list? I‚Äôd like to see it.

I know. I am saying the battle cry should not just be a stronger battle cry. Making them ?/1 would be horrible and just used to trade
---
Nefarian is not a skill-intensive hero. If you are 'good' enough to consistently get him to late game, you don't belong at your current MMR. At higher MMR, people can also play around him.
---
Deryl is the best hero and it's not even close.
---
[removed]
---
wow, they fixed Rexxar's golden portrait
---
Sorry what is your deck exactly? Aggro warrior?
---
Amazing
---
If you're looking to play your homebrew deck against other homebrew decks I'd recommend seeking out online communities or discords with like minded people, rather than getting worked up with matchmaking games.
---
&gt;Why else would someone play such boring decks in CASUAL mode?
---
* Ladder anxiety. They don't want to lose stars to a new deck they are trying out.
---
* Efficiency. People value their time and want to earn their rewards as fast as possible.
---
* F2P. Players do not have a wealth of cards. They have a daily quest that requires them to play a certain class, so they often have to make an aggro deck (since they are far cheaper than control/combo decks).
---
* Split-screening. They are doing other things while playing HS and don't want to have to be so focused on the game itself.
---
Those are just off the top of my head. Don't get mad at the players, get mad at Blizzard for attaching rewards/gifts to a "casual mode". It's a misnomer, it should be called "unranked". That way you wouldn't be under any false allusions.
---
Yes, sorry!  I should have been more clear.
---
I wouldnt, it is very weak to pirate warrior, and I have a good feeling pirate warrior is going to be easily tier one and highly played
---
There are some people that play for the 10g per 3 wins (100 gold/day) so they play aggro decks to do it quick... Also you should know that not everyone enjoys the same thing. Some people like to play aggro and some like to play control decks. Aggro decks are cheaper to make as well and since in this game as a f2p it is nearly impossible to make a control deck (unless you log only to do quests and keep gold for months for next expansion so you can afford buying packs)  you are forced to play aggro.
---
Most likely: nothing you'll notice
---
Preferably but unlikely: faster animations
---
Probably animation speeds. That's like the biggest technical issue plaguing that game mode. If they do balance stuff, then probably removing megasaur
---
Mshinn#1946 NA 80g quest
---
I show, you go first
---
Priest as a class is jusy horribly designed.
---
When it's good, it's only because it has some crazy cancer combo that feels horrible to lose against. But if not, they have no other options. 
---
IMO Priest should be something like this:
---
Good at (Best within the class, not overall classes): Control, Midrange because the HP supports it in a way.
---
Average at: Zoo, Tempo
---
Poor at: Pure aggro.
---
Also some fun archetypes should be supported like Shadowform Priest or something similar.
---
Yeah I've been hitting that wall a lot as someone who wants a taste of variety
---
Holy shit
---
That's a factual statement, not an opinion. You are indeed lying to yourself to feel better about your own incompetence.
---
Maybe you should reread your own poorly written post a few times before you act so condescending...
---
Carddraw in MTG is somewhat divers.  
---
Blue: Straight up draw a lot.  
---
Red: Draw temporarily (similar to Soularium) or paired with conditions like dealing damage to draw efficiently.  
---
White: Heal Hero =&gt; Draw  
---
Green: Not sure atm, never really bothered with green  
---
Black: Sacrifice stuff to draw.
---
They need to balance Battlegrounds more often than they are. I know Blizzard is allergic to regular balance updates but it needs to happen.
---
That's true of any card, though. Hearthstone is all about "oh this deck has a 52% winrate vs 48% winrate, so one is Tier 1 and the other is niche trash", whereas you're only going to start seeing a difference after 50 games.
---
Seen some weird rng this expansion but nothing as weird as somebody deciding to multiclass. (https://hsreplay.net/replay/TLyvXzKoxmPrNuFZWJqMK3)
---
All control players are 500 IQ Chads with 10" penises
---
Actually I won due to countless Zephyrs shenanigans
---
since theres some changes coming any day now i would wait til then. 
---
i play alot of highlander and zephrys and the new alex are amazing and are a must craft for the archetype.
---
Heckler cost less cause his self worth is less, cause he is a bully
---
Worth noting that the video was released not long after Boomsday was released. If you check meta reports released later into the meta, you will see that they didn't classify it as the best deck of the format.

Was it that legendary that pretends it‚Äôs another one at random at the start of every turn?
---
Probably created by Evolve and then bounced
---
respect
---
immediately after the post is made
---
Maybe because people paid dust to craft them and disabling them outright is worse than nerfing them?
---
Not happening.
---
got a new bug where the game got stuck on recruit screen. Relaunching game doesnt fix it and it sends me back into the game still bugged. I think shudderwock and i are playing chicken of who concedes first. A third player already conceded
---
Firebat was playing the deck and shitting on galakrond shaman constantly.
---
Friday most likely.
---
And how does that fare against galakrond shaman
---
Yeah, but it so easily dies to shadowword death that the oppressive number of priests are running, so it's literally unplayable.
---
this man is either a bad shaman player who cant get wins cos of no brain or to poor to play against meta decks(tbh me tho lol)
---
This is wrong. The nerf dust is still live. The announcement stated the nerf period ends on DEC 19th.
---
I feel like all tokens/spawned minions should just be 1 star for damage calcs. They should help in combat but not randomly murder your enemy.
---
You really like them long queue times, dont ya?
---
At least one beetle needs to have died for Undatakah to catch it.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it happens when I switch hero‚Äôs quickly if the one u switched from was golden, the one u switch to will be animated.
---
Not unless it did something broken... like summon more units *and* power up your other cards *and* charge up your 7 mana kamehameha.
---
That worked, I don't even have 2 Seal Fates, I have no idea how that happens.
---
Falstad?
---
Non mech decks ran it because it's a mech? 
---
Ok lmao
---
That worked, I don't even have 2 Seal Fates, I have no idea how that happened.
---
imagine being this delusional
---
Edwin went for Zapp and killed me the next turn pretty much
---
They're wrong, like you.
---
That‚Äôs the point. It reduces you to such low health that you kinda need something to help protect you.
---
I had a game where Dragonbreath actually did help out, opponent had frozen my board and went face, Wandering Monster summoned him and unfroze my board.
---
See? It is a good card. Just as long as you aren‚Äôt actually putting it in your deck.
---
Siamat is a legendary and it's effects are powerful to reflect that.
---
Gyrocopter might have been fine in a different game but this is Hearthstone. If you factor in everything, it is stupidly powerful for a common. Everything meaning: it's a mech so magnetize works on it, evolve mechanics, summoning / cheese mechanics, etc.
---
I play Galakrond, but only because I run a combo deck that requires Fate Weaver. And once in a while you get lucky and have a fully invoked Galakrond to clear the enemy board. 
---
It's sad that Galakrond, which is supposed to be the core card and theme of the deck, is only there because it's required to prime a different card.
---
also the jousting mechanic that was more relevant at the time evil heckler came out
---
Different people, different likings.
---
I dont find football fun at all, yet its a widely common liked sport. I dont say all football fans are inbred retards for liking seeing 20+ people running in shorts kicking a ball into some sticks, because I understand that they can like something different than me.
---
It doesnt matter what I will try to explain to you about what is fun about aggro, because its subjetive and if you dont find it fun, you simply dont find it fun.
---
Please behave appropiately with the other commenters, and stop with stuff like "aggro is cancer" and "fuking aggro players they are mentalli ill", because thats completely inappropiate and shows how little empathy you have for other human beings.

Pretty sure those arms are still bigger than the building I'm currently in, though...

Almost like what makes it worth 5 mana is all the effects and the body itself isnt worth 3 mana... congrats ypu proved my point for me.

---
As I said in another response, you can't just look at a card at face value. This is Hearthstone.
---
There are so many ways to cheat out higher cost minions or make them randomly appear on your board that certain cards become a problem.
---
It's just the sorting layer of the sprite object.
---
I really don‚Äôt want to see a world where they nerf shaman but not this effect that is very similar to mana cheating, if not the same. Not sure what else I would like to see changed because so much focus has been put onto Shaman and Faceless Corruptor.
---
new expansion is full of OP cards. almost everytime you feel like you lost because your opponent used some OP effect. i imagine it's a precise choice of developers. personally i think it's boring. draw right card and autowin
---
True, but playing for value is a lot of fun and value can matter for survival / winning.
---
I mean a 0layed a Eogue who used this to pull both Anubisath Enforcers so... yeah you right.
---
That is a hairy vambrace, not a hairy arm.
---
That being said i dont know shit about warecarft lore.... i assume hunter hero is wearing vambraces?
---
Please note I'm not OP of this comment thread. I just want to add to the conversation, especially to point out other weaknesses houseleft missed. Gotem correctly identifies some of Galaman Shamakrond's core weaknesses. There are others. The deck is sorely susceptible to board clears. Paladin is just the only deck currently playing board clears. In the first days of the expansion, I was doing quite well against shaman with Handlock because of the clears available to me.  As the meta has shifted and settled, that deck doesn't work well anymore, but I'm convinced control decks can handle shaman, even in its current state. 
---
I'll admit I'm actually playing the deck right now. I mean, it's a great deck and I have the cards. How could I not? For reference, I climbed to rank 5 with over 80% win rate. Held above 70% to Rank 4 and have been climbing and falling with WR currently at 65% (Rank 3). Somewhere around 100 games. I mention this to say I have some idea what I'm talking about. To head off a retort, I hit at least rank 5 each season and regularly climb to 5 with +70% win rate on decks from druid, hunter, paladin, shaman and even priest (I love rez priest, which can probably counter shaman as well. It has 6 board clears on top of 6 minion removal spells. I mean, come on) so my success is not attributable just to the deck. 
---
I had the sneaking suspicion that even the unchanged control warrior deck of the last expansions would fair well against this deck (4+ board clears). I actually faced one at Rank 5, god bless him. I ultimately won that match, but only because he didn't draw his clears. If I weren't climbing ladder, I would be experimenting with control deck counters to shaman. Highlander Big Spell Mage is already not bad. All the warriors are playing pirate, but control warrior can deal with shaman. I don't know if a viable deck exists, but warlock has the cards to counter it with a control style deck (3 large board clears, 4 small ones). Heck, my record against zoo lock is the same as my record against paladin (2-4). 
---
Shaman's entire game plan is battlecry and spell oriented. Why is no one teching in hecklebot or unseen saboteur? Hunter is the second highest played class with several T1/2 decks at lower ranks. Why are hunters not teching in wild bloodstinger?
---
All of this is to say that the meta isn't really settled, and most people complaining are likely playing aggro decks (extremely common immediately post-release) and other T1/T2 net decks that just can't answer this particular shaman deck. If you are at a rank floor, I encourage you to try something else. Oh, and once the nerfs hit, we are all going to wish we hadn't ignored deathrattle rogue. It is just as oppressive and will be everywhere in a week.
---
Ehh, living dragonbreath is kind of a nice card though.  It‚Äôs an elemental (pretty sure there was a point where elemental decks ran nightmare amalgam).  It makes all your minions immune to freeze, which...with invocation of frost run in 27% of standard decks right now that‚Äôs actually relevant.  Frost Nova, Ray of Frost and Blizzard are also in...basically every mage deck, with Frostbolt not far behind, and Blizzard and Frost Nova are often discover options off of Zephrys (who has a history of ignoring card text so...).
---
Playrates are low because everyone is trying galakrond and dragon decks right now, but it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if living dragonbreath just turns out to be worth running in some zoo-ish or midrange-ish deck.
---
This way you can craft the shaman deck, and rank up for free and learn some if any weakness the deck has. Then get your disenchant full value after the nerfs. I doubt kronx is getting nerfed so your spending 1600 there, but hes auto include in every galakrond deck. Other cards you will most of your dust back, since I'm assuming the dragon pack will get nerfed and maybe even the rare card.
---
no cause non mech decks dint run it
---
That's really weird. Is anyone else having this problem?
---
It was pretty oppressive especially with Prep. The fact you can clear a board full a taunts and remove any enchantments they had is pretty nice for a tempo deck that likes going face.
---
Usually its caused by getting out of the game then going back in before it forces a reload, it can cause some desync from the server !nd do weird stuff like this, anyways you can tell its happening if there is two of the same card in your deck but its not "stacked"
---
why do u have friends
---
Jesus Christ....I don't even know where to begin with this.
---
Go back and read what I wrote then what you wrote and if you can't see the discrepancy in context and facts then please seek help; I sincerely mean it.  What honestly goes on in your head where you can get so bent out of shape with something someone said about a very specific topic and then put words in their mouth to the point where your response is nothing more than an argument against yourself?

Please no, it‚Äôs the only way I can beat shaman

---
i think -1/-1 is a better nerf than +1 mana
---
To be fair, wand only has a 20% pick rate so people might be picking it more if they've already drawn most of their low cost cards
---
It counters even decks in wild quite hard.  (Note that it doesn‚Äôt wear off at end of turn, they actually need to invest the 3 mana to get their hero power back).
---
Outside of wild, though, not a big deal.
