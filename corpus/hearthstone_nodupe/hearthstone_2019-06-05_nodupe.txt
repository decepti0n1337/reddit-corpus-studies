Too specific, and kinda unfun for when you discover  extra mechs. Just blanket "Echo cards can't cost less than 1" now so we don't have to ask "how does this work with echo" for every future card.

I was honestly surprised to see yet another Shaman hero, pleasantly surprised tho since one of my favorite decks right now is Big Shaman.

The emotes are well voice acted but I think I'm gonna stick with Rastakhan, he's more fun for me.

The combination of large aggro radius, close grouping, and tendency to be surrounded by water to slow you down made them a monster, particularly for human characters, who by coincidence had ALOT of them spawn on islands during their leveling process.

I believe it only works on your opponents turn if they force the minion to attack. This may get down voted if not true :(

Same here. I figured it's more a data display quirk rather than "the update randomly removed cards from decks."

---
Guaranteed if they need to nerf something it *won't* me SN1P-SN4P. They think the card is some amazing gift to their players so the idea of nerfing it would likely never make it onto the table at their little meetings.
---
But let's be real, they won't nerf anything based on Wild any time soon.
---
Ahh thats who he was, the mid-expansion raid boss from Pandaria. Yeesh no wonder you can get him on the cheap.
---
I've been playing for 3 hours straight at rank 4 and 3, and am yet to encounter a mage on EU. I'm just facing Hunters, and Roguetards
---
My ass they are
---
Good. This is literally the only way we see more value for our money moving forward. If they want their profits to go up, just produce more and better content or reduce the price. They can't keep coasting along while maintaining the same price tag and expect their earnings to remain constant (or increase).
---
oh right, that explains why i only drew one dire frenzied huffer the other day.. thanks for reminding
---
Can the same card with different stats be duplicated? In particular could you get a vanilla and dire frenzied version of a minion from 1 master's call?
---
Or just remove them. No reason for the lifesteal heart to light up when there’s also a heal animation on your hero, or for the poison vial when the opposing minion dies to less damage than its health. And if people actually can’t figure out what caused those effects people can just tap the cards, which tells you what any of their keywords do
---
I'd have to guess they didn't settle on Garona simply because pretty much half the original heroes would be orcs(Garona being orc/draenei and Rexxar orc/ogre). My personal choices for a new rogue hero would probably be either Mathias Shaw or Admiral Tethys (With Nanners). Tethys would be cool just because Pirates have been a staple for rogues in HS forever.
---
Afaik its just Murloc Knight as a meme card back in the grand tournament since they wanted a mounted valiant murloc, which fits Paladin. Also due to the old Divine Fervor being really good at refilling hands Murloc Paladin was played at release as far as I know.
---
Same, and it’s still not fixed! It’s a shame too because it looked sooo good full screen and now it’s letterboxed and pillar boxed and looks just crushed and sad.
---
Your suggestions are certainly good for experienced and patient and aware players. But you know the game tries to be friendly to every type. I wish they would add an "expert menu" where you can toggle on/off all sorts of quality of life improvements that veterans would enjoy!
---
what's the warlock exploit..?
---
Or just put in more missle launchers
---
Oh thats a stretch, the meta usually settles in a few days, dont lie haha. But you're right. I'm just enduring a bad streak. Thank you for the insight! :)

Deck ive used since the patch hit.
---
I have no idea what you're saying. I'm starting to think you're a troll.
---
Oh yeah but i still like the heist, i think they made a good adventure in comparison to witchwood and kobolds. But i played the league adventure and thought it was good but the normal mode was way to easy. In my opinion they could release some adventures in the old style and some in the dungeon run style.
---
But the lich king is not at all your average minion, and since your tiers are based on consistency and power, I don't see why captured flag should be lower than the rush/stealth treasures.
---
There are situations when rush/stealth might not do anything. When the opponent's board is empty or in a situation where you don't want to attack, rush doesn't do anything. Stealth also strips taunt off all your minions, and if you are behind on board, youll just lose. However +1/+1 is never bad. It is always doing something, and it helps you win the board. Hell, if the opponent steals your minion, it even loses the buff.
---
An actually fun hunter deck is deathrattle with oblivitron. It’s not nearly as meta as mech hunter, and really only wins against control, but it’s the one hunter archetype that’s not boring aggro or midrange beast.
---
Well, Heist is somewhat decent, can't deny that. 
---
But I wouldn't necessarily say that it's 20 bucks decent. That's quite a bit of money for 15/16 packs. Well, or 2800 gold.
---
Best druid ever!
---
I touched you with my burrito ;)
---
I think it is probably the same tier as small backpacks; has no possible downsides, always gives you value, but typically doesn't have as much carry-power as some other treasures.
---
Do you smell... *sniff*... something burning?
---
Aren't 15 packs 20 bucks?  In addition you get the content and an additional golden pack.
---
She used academic espionage and shuffled a 1-cost bloodlust into her deck. Then she used thistle tea to get three and kill me  
---
### [🙃](https://emojipedia.org/upside-down-face/)
---
If anything, they should get rid of the unnecessary animation for both abilities, overheal and poison to a minion that’s dead from damage alone. I don’t even care if the animation gets sped up if that happened.
---
It's not a stretch at all. 
---
Every single time things get changed, people go ahead and start about how classes or decks are overpowered, a week or two later, those decks turn out to be midtier at best. 
---
Ever wondered why pro players are not so good at predicting a meta, but great at adapting to one? 
---
Because cards have to see play before we can talk about their powerlevel. "Caverns Below is terrible" turned out to be a card, that got nerfed twice. 
---
A meta has to settle first, that takes time.
---
How thick could it get? hmmm...
---
I haven't had much trouble with her. Main thing is to make sure you have way to deal with an early Malchezaar's Imp. Sometimes the RNG is not in your favour but not much to do about that
---
They hadnt spotted it yet
---
Oh really?
---
Cause they way I see it, both Rastakhan and Lei Shen are imponent Kings of an everlasting empire and just boast how great they are.
---
The irony is that this shit happened like 10 hours ago...
---
But Pyroblast is classic, not Rastikhan
---
Tormenting me with that card text
---
Rogue are still viable? Even after the nerfs?
---
Sorry, I just noticed that typo
---
At least when you're life stealing at full life... its just painful to wait there to heal nothing
---
I thought this too, but it looks like it's basic cards aren't counted for whatever reason.
---
Good. I hope it’s true.
---
Has the mobile client been updated?
---
Hearthstone only got to where it did because of WoW Nostalgia, + sunk cost fallacy from people for whom HS was their first CCG, they didn't want to give the game up after investing time/money into it. Now after 5 years its finally starting to happen and the game has to actually sink or swim on its own merits.
---
is this guy they are limiting how much of the masters bundle purchase goes to the prizepool?
---
It's a decent translation of Slyfer onto Hs actually.
---
But:
---
Priest is a class that likes to heal/buff their big minions. So i don't see a point in having a worse than Tyrantus card in any priest deck.
---
Most useful post I've seen.
---
the real criminal here is the ooze generation from [Echoing Ooze] or [Green Jelly]
---
I actually like that idea of showing his damage as just the poisonous instead of the number against minions as their damage doesn't matter if it's always a kill. Adding that information to his attack removes the need to have the animation afterwords.
---
It's health is set to your handsize? Doesn't that mean it can't die from damage?
---
yes
---
It will confuse new players!!!

Which chapter? I've tried chapter 1 a bunch but I never get past the 3rd boss on Heroic. (I've beaten it on normal a bunch of times.)
---
I was having the same issue and I just deleted it and downloaded the app again and final started to let me in the game to play. This is on iOS
---
It probably should but I doubt anyone other than devs can confirm
---
No clue but I’m hoping soon knowing how big of a company wotc is I feel like they aren’t far from it
---
Why did they waste time buffing the other mechwarper without rush?
---
A zero manna Ice Block for all classes. Well, at least you can only run one copy.
---
Works for me. IMO maiev = subtlety, valeera = assassination and Vanessa = combat/outlaw or whatever it’s called now. Should be some sort of pirate themed and she fits!
---
Its the number of unique minions. So if you have 2 bats, 1 pig, 4 wolves and 2 cats in your deck. Since there are only 4 unique minions, your discover will show 3 out of the 4 unique minions in your deack, meaning the 1 pig in your deck will have a 75% chance to appearing in the discover despite being 1/9th of your deck.
---
And it doesn't make you immune to follow up damage, so there's that.
---
They said that they didn't see lethal and just wanted a bigger board, and buffing both is safer vs a silence card/single removal.
---
agreed
---
Just tested it, you're right. You draw the discovered card. The other 2 stay in the deck, so maybe that's what the one you replied to meant.
---
I can still play without "fixing" them
---
I want a lightforged priest. Captain fereeya from argus
---
yep happend to me too
---
They call me the mad man
---
Be careful what you wish for.
---
A 110 power draft from heartharena? I've never seen anything above 80 or so. 
---
Or are you using a different app/tierlist?
---
Hearthstone is a game of rock paper scirror ....I mean ... skill haha
---
Nice
---
Who would even be next skin? Most likly female since warrior doesnt have female portrait yet. So gerayah(leader of maghar orcs),shandris (can work for hunter and warrior) .
---
Spellblade aluriel maybe?(she is spellblade so mage and warr can work and wpuld be first nightborne hero)
---
Thats only female warrs i can think of really.
---
Else blackhand (wod version),varian,saurfang?
---
The current iteration of mid-range hunter is a bit harder to play though. Last expansion it was much easier.
---
Incredible
---
Incredible 
---
Its a pretty fun sweetener along with the card back for 20 packs.
---
I get this bug only for Shaman deck
---
How do i solve it!?
---
Imagine having Edwin be a hero and the interaction he has with himself when you play his card lol
---
when was it nerfed? I know chain gang was b/c of shudderwock but I thought doppelgängster wasn't (making this a bug, right?)
---
Ah, I see you’ve mastered the forbidden technique “click the minion you want mind controlled”
---
Or easier zola on mech warper
---
If you can’t beat em join em
---
What? Giant isnt a issue in wild nor is the combo of khadgar giants in general
---
heh greetings
---
Agree it was beautiful when it was optimized. Haven't tried the new patch but sad to hear the black borders are still there.
---
I'm not wildly proud about it, but yeah, this feels like a good value for me. Especially considering Thrall is so low energy.
---
Yep, that was it.  Thank you!
---
You could theoretically open 507 packs without a legendary. There are 11 expansions, plus the Classic set, and I also counted Golden Packs (some say that there is no pity timer for them, but we haven't got enough of them to know that). Then, you could open 13 packs in a row containing a legendary.

Adventures seem bugged since last update. Just wait until someone fixes them.
---
so here are the latest news: [https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/bwuyg6/hearthstone\_revenue\_down\_37\_compared\_to\_same/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/bwuyg6/hearthstone_revenue_down_37_compared_to_same/)  no rise out of the new card rotation as you and kibler suggested .
---
"WE BE TAKING THAT NOW,IT'S KOBOLD WAY"
---
Seems to be a visual bug and should be fixed soon.
---
One of you needs to update to the latest version of the game.
---
All decks you've mentioned can be used to climb ladder. Maybe try to focus on 1 deck and watch online how others play the deck, this really helps.
---
I havent seen that deck since it got nerfed.
---
Looks like your Khadgar summones a few copies for your opponent
---
Amen.
---
Not a bug - by default, the crafting screen hides uncraftable cards, which includes golden Sn1p-Sn4p.
---
wrong one we're doing the star aligner one lol
---
How, though?
---
Visual bug that should be fixed soon, we hope.
---
Auchenai effects with Lifesteal matter, but it's pretty easy to code around that since it already has to check for that effect.
---
Same here
---
The biggest issue with this tournament that nobody seems to be talking about is the fact that teams were basically given $200 worth of card packs (with limited disenchanting of duplicates) and the best decks they were able to create were a bunch of brainless aggro decks.
---
It's quite telling about the state of the game right now... it's not even "pay out the ass to win"... it's "pay out the ass to have fun".
---
And it summons THE ANCIENT ONE
---
I heard its just a visual bug, and will be fixed. The game should be tracking your wins as it was before regardless what it shows
---
They should only stick around for the duration of the effect that kills them, so it wouldn't work. It may not even work with magnetized missile launchers, since the effects are clearly seen as seperate with the multiple activations.
---
Other than effects that may matter, it's probs just easier to code it that way and they never felt the need to code it differently.
---
Don't you drop 4 ranks from the highest and not the finished? If you get to 4 you get reseted to 8 with the same stars.

It’s not. Your overkill effects only work on your turn. If your opponent plays [[Unseen Saboteur]] and pulls your [[Baited Arrow]] and it overkill’s you wont get the 5/5. Same with tapping one minion into another with [[Super Collider]]

Great point!
---
Finally!!!
---
Ive recently come to love case study. Carnassa or sulfuras and almost always amazing. An early druid or warlock is almost always an autowin. The rest are more situational but I've found that it's still better than many other treasures.
---
Propaganda is almost always an autowin especially because anything you can't control gets destroyed. From my experience I almost always get to turn 10 (though I prefer a slower control playstyle) it is more deck dependant than the rest though
---
Lmao
---
I like how the pogo is slowly drilling into the warrior.
---
"I Choose Death"
---
I don't get it :/ pls explain

Is that encounter exclusive to the Streets or not? Because four board spaces makes it less of a headache.

pls check ur network connection

Thx for the /s, dip

You ok mate ?

This is General Chat Anal [Charge] all over again

What I find most annoying are the speech-popups that you see for example in the dalaran heist. They take up half the screen, and while clicking them away is possible, it also counts as a click in the layout below, which puts other thibgs away like new earned decks or heropowers. 
---
I have to wait like 15 seconds for the frickin speech popup to go away so I ca n see what I just unlocked
---
I played turn 3 two Ragnaroses and won.
---
No, opponent won't miss the lethal.
---
Take the King Krush and trade into the Berserker. That way you can avoid lethal.
---
Lesbian stags?

I nearly shat myself when I saw that!

Heroico, getting downvoted bc didnt find him that problematic haha, Lost way more to vasno than this dude

i think he found a new concede button

du dudududu dudududu du du

rip ice cream shaman. i used to play a different version of this deck. got me up to 12k armor before i crashed :D
---
Please blizzard, if you want to change snip-snap deck, don't touch my boi mechwarper! Aggro mech hunter is my only way of beating big priest and any other board centric match (odd paladin, murloc, etc). 
---
You should just change the snip-snap, don't nerf any other card that have broken interaction with it because the core problem is the snip-snap itself
---
Negative. When you buy the coins it's a discount, this post is about the 20% you get back. Meaning if you spend 100 coins on HS, you'll get 20 coins added to your balance.
---
Turns out people don't respond well to $80 pre-release packages. The community cried out for more freebies and better gold quests and they respond with exclusive heroes only available to big spenders and getting rid of 80 friend quests
---
The difference between twisting nether and missile launcher + venomizer combo is that if you don't have a silence, you just can't play any more minions for the rest of the game. For minion based decks, it's pretty bad.
---
If as a minion based deck i need to start putting silences for other reasons that breaking taunts to go face, I'd rather just start playing control
---
I am now wondering, what would be the single longest string of animation you can possibly have in Hearthstone? Anyways, good idea!, it really gets annoying after a certain point to watch Lifesteal animations (-\*cough\* Obsidan Statue \*cough\*).
---
Trying that now, thank you!
---
No offense, but deleted doesn't read readable ;)

as someone said it isn't only about having a good deck, but knowing how to play the deck. Midrange hunter is a great deck for it budget price and flexibility in many match up. In terms of longevity that is up to you to determine if a deck the deck give you that same value of fun that you are looking for. However, midrange hunter is one way or another has always been in the meta, so it should do you right.
---
Yea because the game added cards to fill in the "blank spots".
---
I was completely on board with Witch's Brew's wording. It's completely in line with the way non-evergreen keywords should be used in card games, digital or not. Keywording Echo on SN1P-SN4P is obviously not in line with that same philosophy, then again, buffing cards goes against established philosophy as well, but I guess we'll see how that works out.
---
I can see why they went with Echo since "Repeatable this turn" is awkward on a minion, especially one that already has a fair amount of text, and maybe they actually have plans to make it evergreen, but I doubt it since there likely isn't enough design space there. Another reason they may have felt justified is because the card is technically part of Boomsday Project and the Year of the Raven so it won't linger as the only Echo card in Standard after rotation the way Witch's Brew would have.
---
I think there's already a 'longest turn in hearthstone' which is like dreadsteed and knife juggler. https://youtu.be/P9J9ARmbdD0?t=147
---
They should make him a 3 mana 2/3 with the text “Your murlocs with charge have +1 attack”
---
Why is it getting downvoted!?
---
Without coin? Whirlwind into execute. Or other activators that warriors don’t play right now.
---
With coin? Shield block into shield slam stops a 5/5. 
---
The second minion? Gotta wait for turn 4.
---
No
---
I doubt they'll let a second jade situation happen.  The pogos don't replicate in themselves and have a finite number that depends on luck and draws. It counters control but then aggro runs them over, and even otk decks can probably outpace them.
---
I think they're still just a meme deck with a chance to highroll but I don't see it being consistent enough. Witchwood piper is the only added consistency the 1 mana buff gave it which is good but probably not enough. If it ends up being only strong against heavy elysiana control decks and nothing else that might be a good thing
---
How weird. I also laughed and I too am chewing gum...
---
As /u/naterichster posted there was an official post acknowledging the bug. 
---
I've been clearing Normal mode with all heroes and it is a bummer to have the visual tracker of progress lost. I think I still have Warrior and Druid left to clear on wings 3 and 4, but I'm not 100% sure.
---
Doing all variations with all heroes is probably too much for me, but one clear per hero has been fun.
---
hunters class identity is midrange
---
Also, forgot to ask this in the other reply. What era of Yugioh were you playing in? That influences the art and names by a lot.
---
There's Hagatha at least.
---
It happens every time I login and it’s a pain in the ass. Also still can’t login on PC.

---

---
AYAYAYAYAYAYAAAAAA
---
or gelbin mekinthorque
---
Paladin has Lady Liadrin. You get her for reaching level 20 on a new character in WoW.
---
Same thing here. I hate it. I wanted to earn these.
---
Bumping this up so it gets noticed
---
How?! Most i got was 4 xD
---
It is a bug of this patch, they claim that it's being stored all the same, and that with next patch will be corrected. It was in their twitter account.
---
Happened to me too
---
You should aim for rank 5, it rewards a golden epic at the end of the month.
---
Oh I totally forgot about her. Haven't seen her in such a long time, I just see annoy, arthas and Uther tbh. Also, haven't seen morgl in a long time either AND I OWN MORGL
---
1. The Warlock Combo is turn 4 with the coin.
---
2.Mage has options with secrets and freezing to stop and destroy the buffed mech or the mech they wamt to survive for one turn.
---
3.Shaman is probably one of the more vulnerable classes to the combo, but they could always run a stonehill defender or something if they're control.
---
4.Hunter has cards like Misdirection, Freezing Trap, and Wandering monster that can all stop an attack, and Snipe could delay the opponent by killing the mech they want to magnetize
---
5.Most Priest decks would probably be weak to this combo, but one of the most prominent priest decks is big priest, and they kind of deserve it.
---
6.Rouge has cards like Sudden Betrayal+Sap or a prepped Vanish that could delay the combo enough to set up more
---
7.I'm not too sure what warrior decks are popular right now in Wild, but they would probably be a weak class against this combo unless they were somethong like taunt warrior, which runs stonehill defenders and tar creepers.
---
8.Druid does not have much tech against this either, but you could throw in stone hill defenders if needed
---
9.Paladin has cards like Repentance+Consecration to kill the magnetize target, the Stegodon buff that would shut down this combo for a good while and make it vulnerable to more later, and even Eye for an Eye if you feel like trolling.
---
10.Warlock would probably struggle unless that bloodbloomed out a felfire potion, but Control Warlock could definitely fit in cards like Stonehill Defender and Tar Creeper, which they have done in the past.
---
11.Some of these are teched in and some of these are cards the class already uses.
---
12.Just because Kripp doesn't like something doesn't automatically make it the worse thing ever.
---
13.My original comment said "join them or counter them", don't get annoyed that i even put the option to join on the table, that's just how hearthstone works.
---
14.Alot of decks run cards to counter things like Big Priest, so they can do the same with this deck, or they already run the cards to counter them, like Mages and Hunters.
---
15.Do you honestly think I don't spend time thinking about my responses? I literally give you a number list of all my points.
---
Exactly what happened, lol.  Minus turn 5, it was turn 10.
---
Ah now when you mention it, I saw a streamer doing this with three mechwarpers, the third being from zola. Weell rip wild
---
This video had me cracking up last night 😂
---
I think resetting but I’m not sure.
---
So what ? You have to keep hunter a midrange class for ever ?
---
Look at every other class : 
---
We had pirate warriors and control war
---
Token druid and aviana druid
---
Aggro mage and freeze mage
---
I could go like this forever.
---
Every class as a complexe identity but it evolves over time so that the game feels fresh except hunter.
---
Still bad
---
They may change it to gain +1 +1 instead of +2 +2
---
I hope this is a lie, I use to watch it a lot when I was a kid and I don’t know why
---
I was expecting either a draw, or for him to win because of the Eternium Rover. I was pleasantly surprised to win. (And he was probably tilted because if he'd traded the Rover first, he'd have won).
---
Presumably if they decided to do a RR buff similar to the Boomsday one, it would come halfway through the next expansion, so there'd only be one more expansion to consider (which would probably already be more-or-less complete from a design perspective when the buffs happened).
---
Can someone explain whys everyone so mad? I've done 10+ runs and haven't met him. What's his hero power? His gameplay style?
---
Shhhhhh
---
there is no ftks in hearthstone he just drew so well coin + galvanizer on turn 1 which reduced the cost of all mechs in his hand by one so since they cost 1 now they cost zero so he played all of them on turn 1 and made a bit of scary early board
---
"Every Hunter archetype tries to win the game. What the hell Blizzard?"
---
Are you kidding me OP? Yes, every Hunter archetype plays cards, and almost every Hunter archetype gets the most value out of their hero power by putting their opponent's HP low. The idea that they "play the same" is utterly absurd though. They're wildly different. 
---
I'm almost certain OP plays some sort of stupid ResidentSleeper deck. Only people who don't play cards think decks that play cards are "all the same".
---
true it only works if your opponent didn't check the card
---
I might be one of those people who play slow. I play while I work 😬. But I try to stay on top of it

---
The "missing" cards are your gold cards. For some reason they're not counted until you open the deck and save it again.
---
Wow.  How did you pull that one off?
---
She also has no card generation so a single 5 mana card on turn 2 is enough tempo to win usually.  I personally haven't had problems with it but she's very oppressive if she gets up at all so i see what you mean.
---
yep :/ I would love a draenei too!
---
Approved.
---
NSFW please. Don't want this type of stuff tainting our Chairman Servers. Jaina's already gotten nerfed, and Blizzard is not hesitant to nerf another character.
---
Same.  Also, all of my "crowns" via victories progress in Dalaran was erased (except for the first three).  Very buggy release.  Might be a widespread release issue?
---
The warrior has literally won at this point.
---
Or the very long time it takes to patch it in ios.
---
Dunno, used the average hyperaggressive murloc deck. That was much easier than warrior and I recalled only a few retries.
---
That was before the murloc warleader nerf tho, dunno how much that nerf hit the murloc cheesing.
---
r/imsorryjon has some of the weirdest shit...
---
Just novice thalnos and acolyte makes it worth it
---
This isn't a Battlecry so you can just never have a turn again...
---
It changed from needing to win with each hero in every wing to needing to win with each hero in ANY wing. I know this because I haven’t won with Druid yet.
---
Same here, but still feel like I play faster than most
---
well maybe YOU can't
---

---
I just want everyone to know I was playing pogo before it was cool and refuse to be shamed now that it works
---
For me the fun thing about these adventures is beating them with my brother, if he loses interest in them from this, the new adventure is as good to me as replaying the old ones.
---
That’s great and not great at the same time. 
---
I’m kinda pissed and kinda relived.
---
I was wondering when you would find him. We were beginning to think you never would. One of us...
---
All of the hero powers are "insane" because whichever one the Warrior can use on any particular turn is random. All hero powers are also two mana. Blast Shield is not one mana.
---
On average, the result of using the Big Red Button is one-fifth of a card, seven-fifths armor, and roughly seven-fifths damage per turn.
---
Also, efficient removal is something necessary for a control decks to even exist.
---

I have had the same thing, repeatedly.
---
Opponent can't play around cards that even you don't know you have.
---
hackathons are the best.  Instead of being told what to do, everyone builds their own ideas, which is often wher the really smart ideas lie.
---
I also see a lot more rogues than priests in legend right now, but of course that’s just my personal anecdote.
---
It’s a bug.
---
That’s true of course. 
---
I just remembered Kibler or Firebat saying that the problem of Pogodecks is usually not that Pogohopper is too expensive. Today I saw Toast playing the deck and in the mulligan he pitched the Hopper away everytime. 
---
Obviously the deck in general is way better with tutoring the Bunny out and combining it with other cards.
---
rarePog
---
But you could do that pre buff too
---
...
---
probably not as rare as golden versions of the old adventure cards
---
It’s a bug with the June 3rd update. It shows the crowns earned for chapter 1 for all wings. It’s listed as a known bug on the forums so it’ll probably be fixed next patch
---
Nah you can’t disenchant the golden one that you get for free
---
Thank you!!!
---
Thank you
---
How long can this go on?
---
I get the price reasoning, however by now most of the packs will only net you some little dust, so buying more is not that effective as opposed to buying at the start of the expansion.
---
When i say play greedy I mean super greedy as in shark totem into heistbaron into toggwaggle scheme. Warrior can't deal with so much value but the bombs might give you a hard time.
---
Oh cool we're beating a meme to death. I wish this sub had some standards.
---
Hey no problem man!!! Thanks for the gold
---
Lolalaosola
---
These brawls are a cute and fun concept on paper but enraging in execution.
---
Get a [[Fjola lightbane]] on the priest's board and go nuts with the buffs. The divine shield will help her survive the board clears and let her damage each turn. All you have to do is keep a buff in hand each turn and heal her up from any damage she might take, easy win.
---

3/3/4 | Whenever you target this minion with a spell, gain Divine Shield.  
---
No longer true. Just played a game where my opponent lost their full board. Quick patch there
---
Putting the dumb thing aside, the stats show that hunter is an overwhelming portion of the meta right now. I believe warrior is even behind mage right now.
---
Honestly, I'm surprised that the mods haven't removed them since they removed posts for less
---
*thiccens
---
They need to be the first one on the board, never lose boardcontrol and have reload for ages. IF it works, it's a steamroll.
---
 GoblinHero#2667 EU Trading the 80g quest. I show - you go first.
---
It's in French...
---
Rastakhan and Thunder King might as well not be in the game as long as Morgl goes unnerfed. I passed on the preorder and the esports bundles because there's no reason to use those over Morgl who is strictly better. They should release other class heros, Shaman has been covered and they obviously can never top Morgl as is.
---
Sorry, we only use freedom speak in here
---
Whys that?
---
my "partner" DC'd when Nef was at 15 health and my partner had lethal on board after a 10 min+ commitment    
---
yeah...
---
Druid: Spirit gives 1attack on your turn aswell
---
 Predatory instincts id prolly make 3mana that or treespeaker destroys treants and then summons anciennts(for mulch muncher).
---
Hunter:  Halazzi the lynx id made 4mana or some + 1attack and rush himself. Spirit to 2mana.
---
Mage : Spirit to 1mana ,arcanosaur cheaper or better body to like 5/4 ?
---
Palladin: Spirit to 3 and axe is  4/3 or buff is + 3/3 or 4/4. Or zandalari templar make it need less health restored.
---
Priest:  Surrender id make cost 2 or destroy 2 instead of 3 crystals sand grudge is a 3/4.
---
Rogue:  Cannon barrage is 5cost(maybe 4 with prep nerfed aswell),Gurubashi hypemon is a pirate now.  
---
Shaman: Warbringer o only 1spell. and kragwa to 5 or zentimo to 2.
---
Warlock: Hireek is 3/3 base.  Demonbolt costs 6/7.
---
warrior:  Akali is 7mana or is  7/7 himself at 8.
---
Neutral: Hallftime scavanger has  4 attack or is a 5/4.  Gurubashi is just at start of turn gain 8 armor or a deathrattle.
---
Ahh, okay, glad other people are experiencing this too. I was so confused when it was telling me I had beaten every chapter with every class.
---
Since when 2 days? 3 days? Lets have this conversation again in two weeks. 
---
Also vs report stats don't mean shit...
---
Fair enough
---
Bruh you're playing a mobile game on my kitchen TV from 15 years ago
---
It's only in the pc version
---
can you post the bomb warrior list you were stuck at rank 18 for 200 games with? i find it hard to believe that's possible unless the deck is missing key cards.
---
I think the hero power damage requirement should be altered, not the mana cost of jan'alai itself.
---
5 or 6 seems fair to me.
---
They don't ban you for giving them money!
---
All minions actually come back together after a few turns in the void, so you just need to survive until then.
---
Honestly, I'd just make Akali a 6/6, just so it has more impact on the board and is a bigger threat. I'd keep it at 8 though, as 7 mana seems a bit strong with Rabid Worgen on turn 10.
---
Don't know why people are downvoting you, literally just had it happen to me.
---
I really wish there was a chat function.  I  have the  quest to win 3 Tavern Brawls and it is brutal. 
---
* The Enrages are at 160 and 60
---
###Enrages
---
  * **160 health**: Become immune at exactly 160.  Deal 4-6 damage to all minions.  Raise attack to 5.
---
  * **At 60 health**: Become immune at exactly 60 health.  Deal 30 damage to the board, heal for 30,  and raise attack to 10.
---
###Tips for Wining
---
* The best strategy is just to buff a single minion to 30+ health.  Stoneskin Gargoyle is ideal. (Shaman has it).  Priest has the buffs and can Seance it if Shaman is unaware.  (But there are lots of good targets, Stoneskin is merely the best because you don't have to worry about healing).  (Second best minion is Priest's 0/7 minion that heals your opponent when you heal yourself.)
---
* You don't need to attack with your minions, just have them soak the random damage each turn.  You stay healthy and buy time.  It *can be good* to give Nefarian 5 attack so you can clear off your own board if it is getting full.
---
*  It doesn't matter how quickly you get to 60 health.  The point is to be ready or it is near impossible.  Save your health buffs for a single minion. 
---
* A bonus goal is to use Justicar on Priest and have your opponent steal it with Sidewshow Spelleater.  Then it is hard for either to die.
---
* Your hand will occasionally swap so you need to just focus on playing the Stoneskin, keeping it alive for one turn (sometimes a buff), and then using all buffs on it.  Try not to buff random minions, but the one you are keeping alive to win the game.
---
* **IF YOUR BOARD HAS NO SPACE FOR NEFARIAN HE WILL WIPE YOUR BOARD TO MAKE ROOM!**
---
You have to play it enough times to know the bosses strengths and then pick cards that offer counters. Like, you can have an awesome aggro run but then maybe boss 7 or so is hari setting sun, and will counter you with the passive hero power -2 attack for your minions plus resurrecting his taunts. Therefore, if im in a run and have yet to face him i will aim to pick up some hard removals or beefy minions, or token minions or something but the point is to think ahead.
---
I guess so ... my priest partner played Eternal Servitude to revive a bomb ... like really
---

---
1 Beast Hunter. Won 1/1
---
1 OTK Pally. Won 1/1.

---
Blood#1966 EU need to spectate a game for quest reward (bump from yesterday)

I really love getting to 9 mana crystals and using its Echo and Magnetic abilities to the best of my ability by forming a crab stack. Both myself and the friend who plays HS with me end up chanting "crab stack CRAB STACK CRAB STACK" for the whole time it's around. I don't even care if it's not strategically the best play for that turn, crab stack always wins in my eyes and heart!
---
wait so if my decks a certain type, I have to just.....guess/know that the hard counter boss will appear and so somehow prepare for them?
---
I dont mind when hunter is the best deck because it has a lot of counters so the meta can adjust very easily
---
Not always possible
---
My first stalled all his rounds and we died horribly.
---
Yep! Speaking of that, if you happen to have wobbling runts on board and 4+ other minions, and wobbling dies during a turn switch where Nef ends up on the runts board, then he has no where to go and destroys himself. 
---
At least, it worked last time, I highly doubt they patched it. 
---
When I get to test it, I'll update with proof.
---
Druid was like a warrior though. Got tanky and controlled the board. At least rogue has no heal or reliable defense in general.
---
Yup. My first 3 "opponents" all thought the idea was to watch me get killed. 
---
I'm on 9 hp and Nefarion summons an Explosive Rune that deals 9 damage. My opponent just lets it detonate at the end of their turn when they had minions who could attack it, doesnt even healing me for 2....
---
I bet when they lost they couldn't understand why....
---
i thought it was makes the peen work....hm
---
Charge your phone.
---
Where are all those people when I’m on ladder?
---

---
Holy crap! When you said "Sn1p Sn4p" I thought you were referring to some kind of code word for getting a vasectomy and I thought you had a bunch of free time resting up. I was just thinking trying to beat all the solo heroic modes was a good way of resting after the operation... Doh - I'm dumb.

---
Ahh, yep, forgot that the first ysarrj pulls something.
---
Rain of toads has a surprisingly good winrate and has been run in a number of overloc lists. I think its fine where it is and would provide way too much board protection at 5 mana
---
In this case it's not a big deal, the worst consequence is someone walks away thinking Hearthstone is making more money than it is, unless you're an investor or shareholder, that information is largely unimportant. However, applying the same process elsewhere... There are a lot of topics and issues where people walk away being mislead on actually important issues and take action or base opinions on misleading info. People also know that other people are likewise influenced and mislead and proceed to spread lies, misleading info, and bad faith arguments to great effect.

Damn, if that's all that it takes Artifact should have been a true contender in CCGs.  Millions of people nostalgic about Valve and a game developer and the DotA fanatics.  And every single player with at least $20 in sunk costs.
---
It lost 95% of it's player in 30 days, as abandoned in 90.
---
/r/ArenaHS may be better for this.
---
I would pick Baron Geddon. Onyxia is solid - but this current Arena meta is way faster than usual, so games can end pretty early. If you have an empty board for Onyxia on turn 9 you're probably in trouble Nexus-Champion is okay, although random Hunter spells can often be dead cards (i.e. getting one of the many Beast-synergy cards and not having beasts). You also don't know if you'll have enough spells to make it worth it since the draft just started. Baron Geddon is great because it can be a board clear, which Hunter sorely lacks. If your opponent has a board full of small minions and you can kill them all with Baron that's a great swing.

I think rogues are going to take over the meta soon. Pogohopper is really strong. Unless a more refined hunter list arrises that kicks rogue butt, rogues are a bit too strong at the moment as is.
---
Turns out prep discounting two mana is still definitely good enough.
---
I did it with the 5/6 side swapper. Teammate windfuried it and won quickly. Helps if your teammate understands your choices
---
How did Raimi get away with this?

"Rough day?"

While his deck certainly is frustrating it seems like he often loses to his own mindgames pulling something weak from your deck. I personally find Zuramat much harder with his 2 mana silence and kill a minion heropower and way too many void callers.
