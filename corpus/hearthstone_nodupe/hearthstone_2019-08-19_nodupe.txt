Are you the guy at the party bragging when nobody is listening ?

---
---
Hearthstone is a pre-alpha mobile game. I think the devs know this game is shit, and has been shit for 4+ years.
---
Except in casual games wishes work exactly that way. Sideboards do not exist in casual kitchen table play, so you can literally choose any card from your binder.
---
That’s like just 3 full expansions.
---
Trading 80g quest on NA, both show first - talokiv#1708
---
Y’all some str8 downers in this community lmao god damn
---
3200, enough to make a golden legendary.
---
Loving when people call blizz out
---

---
Never forget: "Is this an off-season april fools joke?"
---
Good enough reason to stop playing HS for me.
---
What's even more bizarre is the idea of someone playing Mortuary Machine. Surely, that must have appeared randomly, right?
---
They are still looking into Big Priest 2 years later. I've decided that some devs are big priest mains and that is the reason it hasn't been nerfed/changed. Because the wild community hates it
---
Crossfire nerf because of Patches.
---
No, it's literally the game that is broken/imbalanced
---
That's not true tho. In none of the 8 changed cards were any human skeletons or inner organs shown. Instead 4 were changed because they were too sexual and the other 4 because they showed flesh wounds, but no human skeletons or inner organs. The closest thing is headcrack because you can make out the shape of the skull, but 1 "maybe" out of 8 is far from a "distinct focus" imo.
---
Same, I used to rank up to 4-2 back before they had rank floors and I kept finding myself not having fun at all.
---
I took a break during Boomsday and now just play causal to complete quests and run random decks.
---
I had to get out of the mind set that I need to win and get into one where I just wanna have fun.
---
Don't get me wrong, I can get salty after queuing into Warrior or Mage over and over again but i learned to take a break at that point and come back later or the next day.
---
I saw a combo with khadgar plus piloted reaper, with a discounted antonidas and faceless.
---
Mage too, but reno mage and big spell.  Get all legendaries opening the packs, and crafted zephyrs.  Your account is in america server ? We can add each other and borrow our decks.
---
I fucking hope not.
---
Shield slam is fine. Sure Warrior's level of armor gain has been amped up making it easier to get shield slam off, but I think it's fine.
---
As for Brawl, it's practically a full clear but I think it is fair. You can play around it. Once the problem cards rotate, you realize Brawl and Shield Slam are not problem cards.
---
Im a simple man, i see a D4 on the background, i upvote.
---
I think the main issue is the minions costing only 1. They can play 3 huge/powerful minions in a turn and then still play multiple spells. I think the minions should cost 3. That way you build your deck about it (so you don't want small minions)
---
trying so hard
---
Says a person that doesn't play the game.
---
The hearthstone community could play poker and bitch about the power of the Ace card.
---
Wowza!
---
sorry
---
Sad part is they like swingy game-play since that makes youtube etc highlights. That's their goal. They don't really care about competitive game-play. I wish they just game us a game mode for those of us who do care about interactive and not swingy game-play
---
Your friend is 10/10
---
I will unleash my full fury on Reddit.  
---
It will be like a scene from Carnage in the Temple of the Damned.  
---
I might also quit.
---
The way Zephrys works is cool, innovative and all, but I still wish it would die in a fire after it made the opposing mage Mass Dispell my board full of Zilliaxed eggs (Switched to Quest Pala after facing 3 Control Warriors in a row with Whizbang. Faced no warriors after switching).
---
I don't think there should be a universal tech card such as this one. You didn't tech against secrets? Now you have to deal with the advantage they give your opponent. Or at least you would until last month. Instead, now Zephrys lets you tech on the fly by giving you a Flare or something you'd normally have no access to.
---
Lul
---
&gt; Warrior (maybe a stretch) 
---
Warrior was also fantastic for a while. It gave you an instant win in the mirror and allowed you to retain the majority of the control warrior she'll for other matchups.
---
did you write this 3 months ago and forget to post it? if you paid any attention to the meta last expansion cycle you'd know sea giant was standard in cyclone mage and won just as many games with conjurer's calling as mountain giant did. and in the current expansion cycle the most played mage archetype is highlander which is not even remotely reliant on mountain giant or sea giant to win games.
---
the taste or texture isn't really the issue, rare burgers have serious risk of getting yourself food poisoned

Cool name,”:&amp;
---
Fuck ya!
---
He made an awesome one for his phone case that has colour.
---
Definitely came off as snarky, i mean what else were you implying if you say why are you here then, like it's your business lmao.
---
I think brawl's fine just because it's such a common board clear that you know to play around it. You pretty much always expect warrior to have and it's pretty easy to play around.
---
I just have a hard time seeing them nerf Dr. Boom because they've shown before they're willing to wait out problematic cards (Kelseth, carnivorous cube, ALMOST patches since they waited till it was close to rotating) and Dr. Boom is going in two expansions.
---
I also think nearly every nerf they did in the last couple of expansions include at least a few basic/classic cards?  I got really burnt on that mana wyrm nerf

Ice block is different (literally delaying the game multiple turns when you set up an OTK isn’t healthy) and prep was limiting design space. 
---
I’m not saying brawl isn’t a reallllly annoying card, but I don’t think it is what gets hit.
---
It's also hilarious that he calls it a passion project. The dude is just saving images from the internet to an usb stick lol.
---
I got a golden nat pagle last week.  I lived his ability to transform into zephyros
---
Yeah no one said it wouldn’t work, I said no one’s going to donate to his GoFundMe for his hobby.
---
Get fucked lol
---
I was really annoyed when they did that. I've played ramp druid before and it wasn't a problem until druid suddenly had a way to refill their hand and catch up on the board.
---
dont forget about ma boy snippers
---
Can you burn a luigi board
---
Just put pressure on warrior so they can't Boom on curve 4head (this involves playing into Brawl, Warpath, Plague and Dynomatic)
---
Never noticed the hearts on her belt.
---
Personally I would look at the mulligan win rate. Pocket galaxy having the highest mulligan win rate in the deck should tell you how strong the card is because typically the high mulligan win rate card is a cheap early game card not a 5 mana do nothing spell.
---
So you suggest changing rat trap text to: "after opponent plays three cards one of which is not coin cuz that would be broken even though you can totally play around it by not playing the coin, but hey, why bother playing around cards, when we can just nerf them into oblivion. In this spirit we should totally not count coin as a spell for the purpose of auctioneer, counterspell and any other spell based interaction cuz it's not even a card. Oh yeah, summon a 6/6 rat". 
---
I like it, but I think Blizzard is not gonna go for it.
---
IDK I always found Big Priest pretty boring to play even when high rolling
---
But to mention if you're a decent player you can get to Rank 5 with any deck
---
I agree.  I think the problems would be fixed if the giants kept their mana reduction while in play.
---
Could you explain this to me? I’ve so far had success with trusting played stats for most cards, but I haven’t been playing for THAT long, so maybe that’s why
---
Thank god my my account ends in #1988
---
Sorry i hashed your buzz about being a video game vigilante.

You're totally right, you feeling a righteous is definitely more important than OPs point.

You're a big boy and nothing you do is wrong! You're definitely not exactly thhhe same as the people you think you're better then. Nope. Ddfinitely not. You're also psychic and can definitely tell their motivations.
---
Definitely best use for Myra’s is gonna be Odd Rogue or basically any future tempo rogue
---
I like the sheets of the number crunching figures
---
I’m loving Priest Quest rn. I’m running Zetalot’s deck. He went something like 2-3 days without losing to Warrior.
---
Auto-squelch would be great. And yes it triggers me.
---
I can absolutely appreciate this.  ...but this is all the more reason for the cards to be consistent.  Sometimes we use change to 1, sometimes set to 1.  I mean, when we look at [Vivid Nightmare](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Vivid_Nightmare), this wording should really be the wording for a keyword rule for Reborn, since this is how it behaves relating the health.
---
Jesus Christ get some real problems. First, you absolutely MUST squelch someone because them emoting you completely distracts you from your game and gives you a mental breakdown. Then, you require that the game squelches for you because your fat fingers can’t move an inch to press two buttons. And lastly, even when squelch is applied, you still moan about the fact that you can see them hovering over their hero? If a flashing border around their hero traumatizes you so badly, I’m afraid you should stick to single-player games like angry birds and try to avoid human contact altogether, because you’re not prepared for what the real world has to offer. No matter what job you get into, you’ll have to interact with humans eventually and when you do sometimes the humans aren’t your parents that coddle you all day long and you’ll have to learn to hold your tears when they show even the tiniest bit of disrespect. Seriously, get some real problems.
---
F2p btw.
---
And can also be casted for free with 8 mana guy
---
Really, using a feature in game would get people disqualified? Tell me more about that, with facts.
---
I easily climbed to rank 5 this season with Control Warrior but mostly Mech Hunter. But seeing as Boom will probably be nerfed and everyone is playing counters to control warrior atm, I'm having a bad time with it now.
---
combo decks in mage btw
---
I also don't think that's quite true at all, although I appreciate the help and I completely understand that money helps A TON is a situation like this. I don't even ask for a solution that will suddenly get me to 20k dust to craft a highlander mage. Just one that would put me in a spot where I could confortably craft Secret Hunter or something!
---
I'll take shaman stone over warrior/mage fest. At least deck was cheap.
---
Intentional or not, as someone in food service, I can appreciate that the rare burger is blue.
---
No, you don't. Triggered effects do not break stealth, and haven't for a year.
---
the stealth breaks after it goes off
---
Thanks for the tips, it really helps! I'm definitely motivated to get legend, but I think having decks that i'm not enjoying that much at the moment like Control Warrior is setting my off a bit. I have a mech hunter, but a pretty standard one, and it's not that strong in the actual meta unfortunately!
---
I'll make some stuff of my own in my future decks, thanks for that tip! And congratulations on legend =)
---
I do squelch. Yes, when people purposely spam portrait clicks it distracts me. And no it’s not a big deal to ask they implement a feature to auto squelch, or to silence opponent actions on my turn.
---
I used mostly Paladin from about rank 2 to to legend and used murloc shaman and control warrior from 5 to 2
---
Not since Witchwood.
---
I just have a budget version because you need like 10 legendaries so here it is

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
You should definitely add ziliax, legendary defile, and zephyrs if you have any of them, they aren't as necessary as the other legendarys I have in the deck
---
Trash talk is a thing in sports. You try to get the other guy to lose their cool so you can get an advantage. It isn't very sportsmanlike, but not everyone is a saint.
---
People will say whatever they want. If you forcefully try to silence them, you are the one who is being unsportsman. You just gotta do your best to not listen/let them get to you.
---
Blizz gave us squelch. That's more than enough. There's no reason to let the person know they've been squelched. Talk about unsportsmanlike. Just take the high road and enjoy your silence. No need to rub it in.
---
As in evolving into it or summoning it from RNG, no way do they know it will summon this exact minion.
---
Not always.
---
If you have low health, it offers a heal instand. If opponent equipped a weapon, you get the weapon removal instead.
---
Remember when everyone made the posts wanting control warrior to be a thing because they missed it?
---
I hope they nerf Pocket Galaxy, Dr. Boom, Conjurer's Calling &amp; Omega Devastator.
---
I feel like most people would agree with those being the problematic cards.
---
This guy wasn't fun with Robes of Gaudiness. Try getting all that crap out of your hand when you can only play two cards a turn... and you keep getting milled.
---
I used to play tournament chess all the time, trying to distract your opponent would get you a warning and then get you disqualified. Not hard to understand.
---
Cause it's literally the example used. On board, you are way too far off lethal this turn, no single card can help you win.
---
*Zephrys looks at the board state information that is known. It doesn't look at the cards you have in hand or what is inside your deck.
---
Say my opponent is at 12 (health) and I have a Fireball in my hand. I would want to use my Fireball in hand first and then Zephrys is going to recognize that your opponent is only at 6...now here's another Fireball for you to then throw at their face. Doing your actions first and taking your turn and then guiding Zephyrs into what you might want to be doing later in the turn I think it's something that players have learned. *
---
Next day delivery though :(
---
I'm going to wait, giggling, with my quest Paladin for the second they nerf Mage and Warrior.  And then I can drink tears anew.
---
What does it for me is choosing a meta deck which is at least somewhat enjoyable (for me that was Big Spell Mage which I made on like day 3 of the expansion) and playing the game less so it doesn't feel like a grind. I just make steady progress and day by day find I'm a game or two away from legend, hit it, and then I'm free to go back to jank (my personal favorite rn - maly druid)
---
I mean yea you run it but it's highlander so it's not like you consistently use conj on giant in those games. I usually end up using conj on something like reno or kartut for tempo or something. If you can play early giant into conj its still good just not like cyclone mage where you always had giants for your two copies.
---
Also, playing against Mecha'thun and DK Uther feels fucking bad when you know exactly what your opponent is trying to do, but there's few counters that aren't just praying you somehow fuck up their combo.
---
By your argument all people who devote large amounts of time to the game will hit Legend. And perhaps that’s true, because time eventually equates to skill. Though by that same argument the only reason why I’m not as smart as Hawking was is because I didn’t devote as much time to physics. 
---
But there’s lots of people who devote lots of time to the game, and for some people it takes less time to climb (which is reflected in higher win rates). 
---
I think if you looked at the people who regularly hit Legend you’ll find higher win rates than people who spend equal amounts of time on the game. And that boils down to skill and optimal play.
---
Yes! Please!
---
Well the new non-boom control warrior might use the quest as a way to generate recurring value seeing as cards like livewire lance are being printed and likely will be included in control warrior post rotation. Don't dust it yet ;)
---
Yep, although druid quest doesn't run out of gas at all. The main problem with it is losing 5 turns of the game and the comeback is not strong enough. The other problem with it is mage dropping minions you can't clear cuz "class identity" and then just losing as you can never create a stronger board vs the mage
---
Reddit is just full of noncasual players. Don't let them crush your fun.
---
What people typically refer to as "side boob" isn't in this picture.
---
It's a nice milestone for those to play it very often, to say "Yeah I hit Legend once, what a glorious achievement." It was extremely stressful but my gosh, that final boss when I did it the first time felt so good. I like milestones in any game I play, whether it's reach the highest rank (Legend will suffice, never going to aim for Rank 1 Legend) or unlock all of the aesthetics (golden Heroes in this case, only Warlock atm) or whatever it may be; I like aiming for those and trying my hardest to achieve them.
---
It's really hard for me to just play a game casually. I need a reason, and an end goal makes that fun for me. Honestly, whenever I do get all heroes golden...I'm not sure what I'll do. I really hope they make a next tier by then so I can aim for 1000 wins with everyone.
---
I felt that nat pagle is a decent card
---
So in my opinion a legend push is very different from a rank 20-2 climb because of the fact that, yes you will fizzle out and feel bored if you play a "meta" boring deck, but once I get to rank 2 the actual "grind" becomes more fascinating then the actual deck I'm playing; for example, I used Highlander Hunter for this month ranks 2- legend, and for the 30ish games I spent climbing I felt like I was so in sync with the deck that I began analyzing opposing decks and playstyles way more than focusing on my own cards, meaning I began memorizing and planning for power plays in every matchup, seeing threats before they happen, and even looking into advanced metrics from time to time to see if my micro-adjustments produced results; in short, I would definitely play a fun deck to rank 2, but the legend climb is a different kind of fun altogether.
---
Cheers
---
Well that would be sad, but I'll take the brawl nerf. I hated that card since day 1.
---
They can make it 11 mana for all I care.
---
And while I'm laying hot takes...
---
Omega Devastator isn't even a problem. If boom is out of the picture I don't even mind it. I don't have a problem with warrior having a removal card that can't be played before turn 10 (unless they want a Yeti). The problem warrior has is that it's too strong in the early game, while being near invincible in the late game due to Boom.
---
Devastator doesn't help the early game, and while it helps in the late game, it barely makes a difference when most of warrior's power comes from Boom; They could run any strong mech and with Boom's rush it'd be good enough. Like, they could replace Devastator by Mechanical Whelp and do just fine, with the 2 damage rusher followed by a 7 damage rusher.
---
Nerfing Devastator (to a reasonable level) wouldn't affect the meta nearly as much as changing brawl, warpath, dyn-o-matic, their rush minions, etc (or of course, Boom).
---
Were you distracted by something else?
---
They most likely could take a machine learning approach to this and train a zephrys model to give out good cards. However this would occasionally result in behaviors that don't make a lot of sense and it would be very difficult to make changes to correct these behaviors. Also running such a model at scale for millions of players could actually significantly drive up the costs of running the game.
---
That's a good tavern brawl idea.
---
Cool find
---
While I'm super looking forward to it's introduction into arena in a few weeks I really have no expectation that this would translate well into Hearthstone (and the only ones to playtest this are team 5 lol)
---
Octosari's putting work for my Aggro Highlander Warrior.
---
Doesn't help that the meta has been constantly in a very bad state since Witchwood.  Every so often it's good for about a month, then stagnates in a low-disruption meta, whether it be Baku or Control Warrior.  They print a few hoser cards, but even then they're not strong enough or are so tailored against a specific archetype that they're dead draws against any other deck.  Who in Team 5 decided to make the 2 best classes of RoS get even better cards in SoU?
---
At least shamans made you feel like you had a fighting chance. Now coin Pocket galaxy on four or boom into seven billion rush minions is not a very interactive playing experience
---
Who else read this in his head with HS innkeepers voice?
---
I still have my golden one. Neverdust!!
---
(1 exception) I did dust my golden Zerek the master cloner after realizing that it will never be relevant. I'm pretty sure 3 expansions down there will be a rare card with the same effect but different mana cost.
---
Absolutely.   
---
Quest shaman will always finish the quest. Play 6 battlecries is stupid easy, especially with a lot of lackeys. Double battlecry may not be as impactful as playing multiple high cost legendaries in single a turn, but in the long run it definitely generates more value.   
---
And, as mentioned, the big catch is whether or not Luna's is even drawn. Turns 6-8/9 when the mage can only maybe play one or two good cards is a huge chance for Shaman to outright end the game. Quest is guaranteed to be playable on turn 1, and is usually finished or nearly done by the time a mage is able to get out Luna's if they're lucky enough to draw it.
---
I wouldn’t bring up post history if I were you.
---
Also, I don’t have a fucking “boner” for priest combo, I just hate people saying it should be HoFed. If anything, I think it’s a trash combo that needs set support to work.
---
You clearly didn’t actually *read* any of my posts on the topic
---
I like it, you better play conjurer only on "un-pocketed" minions, which means either giants or only minions that you draw before luna pocket, great.
---
The Kardashians!
---
Mechathun warrior beats control warrior every time if you don’t make major misplays.
---
Can you please ask them to nerf mage and warrior, and to give us some free packs ? :D
---
This is quite normal, once you have played for a while.
---
Great to know, thank you my feloow mechathuner ;)
---
Really great list! Excited for the next installment =)
---
This happens every 5 games
---
Brawl always leaves your weakest minion on, or their minion on board if there's any. Not that unpredictable imo /s
---
u/harvestgolem
---
It’s so immature to not want the entire priest core HoFed. I mean, why would I *want* to be able to use my priest cards.
---
I may have been overly rude, but that’s only because I finally opened Velen a week before Mind Blast got canned, so forgive me if I’m averse to HoFing classic cards that have never been a problem by themselves.
---
And they are easier to find in WOW :p
---
ps : excellent work.

Seoul's winner said himself that his game plan to win was drawing luna's pocket galaxy. Every single mage player will tell you they will win if they play galaxy on 5. What more do you need ?
---
Unpopular deck to beat control warrior: Brian Kibler Quest Thief Rogue. It has 1 togwaggle scheme to copy your Tess for endgame so u will have Tess to play every turn. Eventually warrior will run out of brawl/warpath and cant beat ur army of Tess.
---
Ye, but with cards made for the Commander role not existing legendaries, maybe multiclass (like Mage-Hunter) that allows cards of the two classes to be in the deck, with special rules like a keyword that makes them start in hand and when summoned id adds a copy of it with increased cost (how much? it depends on the commander itself), if it leaves the field it just dies no matter what and some extra rules like that.
---
But Luna's IS a buff applied to minions un your deck only.
---
If you nerf luna, boom will be the strongest again. We need nerfs for galaxy, boom and CC.
---
Not sure about the perfectly fair part. It has pretty much everything, tempo, card draw, a pretty strong finisher..
---
Maybe 2 legendaries. Depends on how much money you make. Can you throw around money like that for some packs in a card game? There aren't that many cards in the expansions. To me it isn't worth it I have been F2P with the exception of adventures. I just play arena to get packs. I find arena more fun than using my own decks and playing vs the same shit all the time anyway.
---
Faceless, Floop, Gloop Sprayer
---
3 legendaries is expected. Around 15 epics is expected, which includes duplicates. Would I recommend? No.
---
Buffs are great but they should get ready for a quick fix after buffing cards. The issue is not the buff, it's the long time before a fix.
---
i'm really interested in how you made them . I want to print out various custom card games but I'm not sure where to start on type of paper , cost or even delivery . did you just print it from a local place or did you order it online?
---
What's the point of the image?
---
Not many aggro decks beat priest tho because priest has a lot of insanely good tempo plays in turns 1-3. Not many decks can remove just so much health priest has to offer early on right now.
---
Now do the golden ones!   
---
But honestly - nice job!
---
Average is 1 in ~20 Packs. But that is statsitics. I got 6in my 80 preorder. With my gold saved i opend 150 packs since release. In that 150 Packs I reached the pitty level (35+packs in between legendarys) 3seperate times. So I got 3 Legendarys in ~90 packs and 7 in 60 packs.
---
The giants are only problems because blizzard cant come up with good ideas, just rng and power creep.
---
This is completely out of place on this sub
---
Robes have to suck at least against some bosses, considering they're a free win against everyone else.
---
Nor does he recognize lethal if he thinks you can use your hero power for lethal. Example:
---
You play Hunter in wild but you are currently in Rexxar-mode (so no Steady Shot), play zephrys with 4 mana left and your opponent at 6 life. You wont be offered fireball because Zephrys thinks you can use your hero basic hero power for lethal, so you will be offered Eviscerate and other 2 mana options.

This is great content. Hope you keep it up
---
And then i remember why I stopped. Because mech hunter is basically the same deck but with only a couple cards changed and its also much better
---
He's playing hydra against a double taunt and small minion you wouldn't mind throwing away. He doesn't need you to kill him, the man is suicidal.
---
a correction, dr. boom gives 7 armour :)
---
But you destroy his shredder to get him to jump out of it and take you head on.
---
Lol. I don't think you should feel dirty.
---
I got the last 40 wins playing Odd Paladin in Wild to rank 5...that will make you feel dirty.
---
To be fair, I got about 60 wins playing Making Mummies Paladin in standard to rank 5. So maybe the karma balances out?
---
No
---
He’ll be in Netherstorm for sure.
---
A card that buffs the board. Currently there’s enough support and methods of duplicating Zerek (more would be good of course, but not needed) that all he really needs are cards that keep him around longer. For example, if a spell for Priest came out that gave all minions on your board +3 Health, I could see a Zerek deck becoming viable (granted Warrior gets nerfs).
---
Maybe some 0 mana buff card? Problem is, buff priest decks normally top out at 5 mana, so it's hard for Zererk to fit into those decks.
---
With 1 expansion left of him being in standard, I think it's quite safe to disenchant, especially a golden one.
---
And that is great. But it should also happen with minions on board. They should retain any reductions.
---
It's a physical card game sillys.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/cs1soz/to_all_the_redditors_without_imagination_saying/
---
I think cards like the original Reno showed how valuable healing was. It could be really helpful buuut aggro has moved on to being far more burst damage than before.
---
At least there wasn’t a few sorcerer’s apprentices near by or this would have went on forever.
---
Are you agreeing or disagreeing with me because I agree with what you said. Priest is supposed to be a value oriented class but it's classic set is horrible which is why it needs way more expansion support than warrior who has a great classic set on top on recieving insane value cards in expansions.
---
Ohh didn't know that ,thanks for the info tho. Anyways it was more of a taunt statement than a serious one.
---
No, they haven't hotfixed those issues. This was their last hotfix on Zephrys: https://www.hearthpwn.com/news/6888-zephrys-the-great-hotfix
---
You have that card once in your deck. Dudes with rush won't carry you if you don't *consistently* get more than one a turn.
---
Fair enough!
---
To do cool meme-y stuff
---
I see warrior getting rekt at their own long and lame game, I upvote.
---
Yeah, they've stopped selling solo adventures in the stores, in favor of occasionally introducing dungeon runs with the reward of getting packs. As for duplicates in packs. You still get dupes in packs, however you no longer get legendary dupes, however, you can still golden versions of legendary cards while also getting their regular version.
---
It’s Nat what Cho were expecting
---
I hate me.
---
It is heavily R rated so don't if you are under aged.
---
The problem with both changes you mention is that they are designed to impact specific groups. For somebody min-maxing quests the +10g change gives about 100g more per expansion. For me the last big positive change was introduction of friend quests. At the same time Blizzard keeps slowly increasing the economic pressure. So one more question,  will you be generally still fine if next year they will decide that there is no more need to hall of fame any cards?
---
Infinite shudderwock: lol
---
Jaraxxus is such a weird card at this point. It’s a minion that can turn into hero. Unlike any other hero card it sets your health and gains no armor. Considerd as demon but gains no buff from anything but dies to sac pact. Even if you buff the minion before being played it gains none as hero. Like you can make him 3/30 but you still get only 15 health as hero. One of the most least consistent and intuitive card in whole hearthstone set.
---
HoF mountain Giant, Luna's to 6 are good enough to make mage feel better to play against.
---
Considering the numbers, Warrior is the bigger and more difficult to tackle, issue.
---
I can confirm that I just got golden Zayle for getting all five acts, so it wasn't a pre-purchase thing.
---
Impressive. Playing since beta... never got more than a single legendary in a single pack. I did get 2 in 2 consecutive packs though.
---
OP? Yes. Fun? Absolutely.
---
I find this hard to fap to.
---
Missing the shaman nerf just for the heck of it but pretty spot on otherwise, regrettably
---
The Naga-Giants deck felt frustrating to play against so I totally get why anyone who experienced that or multiple Big Priests in a row would have a pretty negative view on Wild.
---
Against Wild combo decks, you still have Dirty Rat / Loatheb / Deathlord / Skulking Geist to along with newer cards like Hecklebot and Unseen Saboteur. And more importantly, the power and frequency of aggro decks make combo decks rarer on ladder than if the aggro decks didn't exist. The lone exception is Exodia Mage. 
---
Ultimately, Combo and Anti-Control decks are by design favored against slow, reactive decks. It's not too different than how control has higher winrates against aggro, or how aggro has high winrates against combo and anti-control decks.
---
In wild, it’s easy to pull off if you sub a couple things out of the regular Mechathun package for the linecracker/bees combo stuff, but it’s also hilariously bad in everything except casual lol
---
I thought it was common knowledge?
---
I've climbed from rank 10 to rank 4 (and four stars). Current record is 36-19 (65%).

Replace your opponents hero power with a shitty one.
---
Yep, Zephrys has been disappointing me a lot lately.
---
Which are considered to be standard? Ty
---
Nice
---
Might just want to try wild, will probably be more familiar to you.
---
There are 4 - 5 anti-combo cards in the game right now, and all of them are decent enough to put in a deck.  Sometimes you don't manage to hose their combo, but that's just how card games work, sometimes you lose.
---
They limited the card to Classic/Basic sets already. It should be possible.
---
If jaraxxus gets handbuffed he should have more hp he replaces your hero
---
Hey OP. Can’t help but notice your Equalities still cost 2. Are you gonna update that? Or you gonna keep playing on a separate patch?
---
"Whooooaaaaaa, LEH-zhen-de-reh!"
---
I for one am shocked that L'il Exorcist was somehow unable to curb Undertaker Hunter.
---
lol found the non-programmer
---
u mean twisting nether
---
Zephrys be like "Keep misspelling my ducking name and I'll keep missing you lethals."
---
Well, it could take selling thousands, not three hundred, of commons to pay for say a Liliana of the Veil.
---
I'd hardly call the system we have busted.
---
My man! I played a game the other day where Maelstrom Portal spawned a Weasel which led to me putting shudderwock's into my opponent's deck who was playing quest priest so every shudder he played set his health to 40 and spawned a board full of deathrattle taunts due to N'Zoth.
---
That's a fair and valid opinion. I think he's a cooler concept, but in practice, he's going to be used for like five things in obvious situations once people figure him out. He's basically just going to be giving Wild Growth, Tirion, Roar/Lust, Fireball, BGH or a board clear 99% of the times he's played.
---
Imagine his last card is MecaThun, and you 4 damage off lethal.. that would be a shame.
---
Correction, wood wood.
---
Of course, I almost had lethal on board. He can only gain 2000 armour once in the game. I also had a 20,000/20,000 Storm Guardian in my hand.
---
This is stunning. I love it.
---

\# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
Pretty lucky, 1200 dust right off the bat :)
---
Any tips on piloting the deck? i tried it before but i just wasn't apple to fullfil the combo
---
I agree entirely. I’ve had some wonky big shaman games in standard like pulling off a star aligner combo with not even having him in the deck. 
---
Whacky games can be a lot of fun
---
Conj doesn't need to be nerfed-I'd move devastator to 6 mana and add better stats to it, I'd nerf pocket to 6 mana seeing how Miscreant was a problem and they only took off 1 health point.
---
Brawl is not op, Shield Slam is not op, Intellect isn't OP. Probably the most op card in the bottom row is sorcerer's apprentice.
---
Big Priest is just way too RNG heavy, if you get a lucky turn 4 Barnes you autowin otherwise you mostly lose.
---
Running that always pulls shield block when I want a board wipe, and brawl when I have a wide board.
---
I asked this question during the AMA and this is what I got:

I just don't enjoy playing enough when all you do at the higher ranks is face against these copy and paste decks from the internet where most games just end up the same. I love playing this deck because you never know what's going to happen. Sometimes I get screwed over and end up spawning a legendary that ends in my demise but that's what I find fun.

I think toki was the only time I didn't win on my first go through. Good luck.

if there would only be a keyword for "has +X damage while damaged" so Zephrys could interact with it /s
---
I think a 1 mana 4/4 is pretty good idk
---
Demons, not weapons.
---
There isn't nearly enough training data in hearthstone for such an algorithm to get anywhere close to "kinda-sorta-reliable", and making it work by learning from language outside the game would be the kind of technology that makes robot butlers possible.

Again?
---
You have no idea how angry I get at the dalaran heist when one of the bosses that has many resses keeps bring back these totally normal and not strange at all minions back...
---
Either way, that's exactly why I don't buy cards anymore.
---
&gt;for those of you who just play decks you want regardless of your rank and win ratio, how do you do it? Does it bother you to have a net negative win rate?
---
The best advice I can give you is to choose a class you particularly despise and optimize your janky deck to defeat it in the most glorious way possible. In this way, you'll have your satisfaction of winning while playing your janky deck with a low winrate.
---
You’d probably need to discount him to 0 or have two sorcerers apprentices/radiant elementals while your opponent has a large minion and minimal other threats
---
He gives tirion evrey time he thinks you need a strong power play
---
I think adding a loatheb will help you out against mechatun decks.

I leave for a couple expansions and this shit got crazy!
---
You know that emoting is not BM?  ^("dickbag")
---
From Hearthstone?! Yeah try from Warcraft III, he’s long dead by the time hearthstone came along and honored him with a card.
---
&gt;  two sorcerers apprentices/radiant elementals  
---
Nah he doesn't take card text into account it seems. I just wish there was a way to make him give mind control if you have 0 mana left for the next turn.
---
Classic, Witchwood, Boomsday, Rhastakhan, Rise of Shadows, Saviors of Ul’Dum
---
This is secret resolution 1 : 9 :D
---
Iirc, the AI in solo adventures can get enrage based lethals, so that should be possible for enrage mechanics specifically (as well as silencing frozen minions for lethal, since that is a broad enough check).
---
Dealing with text in more specific minions such as Amet would be significantly harder, though. In theory the devs could add an "ongoing danger" variable to each minion with ongoing effects, in order for Zephrys to better weight in which ones of those are threats and when the threats are bigger than raw stats. But that would require adding this variable to each card that already exists, plus each card that is ever added, plus balancing and rebalancing the variables every expansion, since some effects would get more or less dangerous according to other cards. As it is, programming Zephrys was already very complicated, and making it consider individual card texts for every card would be pretty much impossible
---
It is not a machine learning algorithm.
---
It is a basic game-tree-search algorithm that brute-forces the solution at least for lethals so you don't end up with situations where the player is much smarter than your really dumb AI.
---
I understand what you are saying, but a game that is competitive should not be determined by "who drew X card first".
---
Luna's is just a poorly designed card in that it removes any skill whatsoever. The person that plays it isn't winning because they outplayed, outskilled their opponent. They are merely coasting off an insanely broken card. Mana exists to make this game have decision making, resource management, and mana efficiency. When you get Luna's early, it removes that aspect from the game. Mana is irrelevant. You are now playing a different game. Of course you are going to win. not many can deal with a Pharaos board turn 6.
---
As for Boom. Again, the resource management of the game is being affected. Boom is making Control Warrior more than what it should be. I have no problem with control warrior having a thousand tools at their disposal. But, because the sheer power of those tools, they should be limited to only what is in the deck. But, with Boom, they have limiitless supply of new tools and ways to shut out the opponent. So much so, that it becomes "find a way to deal more damage than your physical deck can allow". Sure, Boom and Mages can be beat. But, when you look at how, more than not it is because Dr Boom or Luna's were not played/ not played early enough. And that is a problem, especially if you wanna talk about competitive gaming.
---
TLDR - You should not win a game just because you got a card early. Cards that cheat mana or remove limits from a deck are not healthy, nor do they do anything to determine skill/ therefore are not reflective of actual competitive play. They are basically coin flips.
---
Zephyrs Fordring
---
A game tree isn't machine learning.  It's checking all the possibilities, not training an algorithm to give better future results.
---
Target a minion with the upgraded warlock hero power.
---
Highlander Warrior seems interesting and fun. What does Octosari do? I get that Warrior struggles a bit with card draw but drawing 8 isn't worth it, is it?
---
so is rogue like playable again?
---
Perhaps you can incorporate coffin crashed/blatant decoy and go for some crazy priest resummoning deck.
---
It does in Australia.  Don't ask why, none of them know.  It's basically ubiquitous there, even amongst not-young people.  Drove me nuts for years, and then I gave up.
---
I'd take that card over the shit they replaced Mind Blast with.
---
name a worse spell for Saboteur to hit than Cataclysm, and both cards are barely played, the spell is maybe only to find in this one deck. so, while i agree with ur opinion, i don't think it fits right this post.
---
The technology just isn’t there yet
---
You forget Unleash the Hounds combo when it used to give your beasts +1 Attack and Charge
---
YES! Thank you for the feedback! This is my go to deck still and I love it. So many broken broken broken things it can do. You are right it can struggle to turn 5. I always mulligan looking for doomsayer, Messenger Raven and Arcane Keysmith. Frost Nova can help as well. If I get a quest match I blow them out of the water every. single. time.
---
IIRC, when you have 10 mana next turn, and you play him with your last two mana, he usually gives mind control if your opponent has anything on the board.
---
Inner rage would have been lethal on any able-to-attack minion , despite the fact that this minion has enrage. Also since enrange was a keyword , it should work with Zeph because he understands keywords like windfury.
---
I feel like there is a chance they change how overkill works to prevent the 2500 armour game in one turn. In regards to the 7x400 attack shudders, that is very very uncommon and a lot has to go right for that to happen.
---
Don't forget freeze mage with 5 Mana Blizzard, 3 Mana cone of cold, and 8 Mana pyroblast.
---
So close.
---
Okay, any may have been a little bit of a stretch but with a basic/classic deck you could
---
Well giving him 3 atk would still result in a destroyed skull as it would still lose durability when attacking, it would just give you three more turns of summoning.
---
Well to be fair a neutral 29 heal is a lot better than a restoring 3 hp, not to mention cards like molten giants getting slammed down before the big heal
---
Nah m8. He thinks that Lay On Hands is basically a win condition. Heal for 8 AND draw 3 cards? That basically solves any board state!!!
---
Hey, I guess I have time to finish all the villains in all the wings of the heist!
---
I will shred your armor down to its last atom
---
They can never do something like that because all the people who use mass disenchant will demand compensation
---
Fair point. I myself would rather have everyone see your accomplishments, instead of hiding it. When i started playing i was frustrated as well when i faced a lot of golden heroes, but thats why i wanted one so bad and what made it so special when i got it. Now it just doesn't feel that special no more, if everyone is special, no one is. But hey, everyone can have their own opinion, cheers:)

Then shouldn't Morgl the Oracle die to [[Hungry Crab]]? He is a murloc.

I wonder how unbalanced a Dreadsteed-style Reborn minion would be? For instance, a 4-mana 1/1 with the text "This minion always has Reborn."
---
Yaaaaa but it seems you would be likely to just roll into a 50g quest.
---
So what? I hate control warrior as much as the next player but how is that relevant to this post?
---
Aaaaand Zephyrs into Twisting Nether ftw
---
Thank you for making me remember why I shouldn't get back to this game.
---
Okay, that was a good troll. Got a chuckle outta me.
---
If I play hunter, and I do 8 dmg with my hero power and the enemy is at 8 hp, and there is absolutely no board, and I have 7 mana, will I get Janalai?
---
It's certainly not unrealistic to "teach" the card about common, evergreen effects like "while damaged" though
---
Rise of the Mechs buffs were good
---
That’s a fair enough argument against the articles.
---
I do wonder, though, why the sub would be so against this type of piece when it allows almost any other post regardless of how vapid it might be.
---
This one isn’t particularly dense or in-depth, but I don’t think most posts on this sub have much of a standard to live up to.
---
Further, the guy I responded to was disproportionately rude, so I’m thankful for your response.
---
That's why we can't have fun things
---
It doesn't matter if you have two Renos. The battlecry will always activate
---
Could you hook me up with the decklist?
---
&gt;until recently, aggressive warrior decks always performed better than control warrior.
---
This was really only true post Gagetzan, when pirate warrior became a great aggro deck and control warrior became irrelevant due to the jade mechanic. Before then, control warriors were usually better. Aggro warrior decks didn't really even exist before Old Gods, when tempo warrior and dragon warrior became meta viable. Before then, aggro warrior was kind of a meme, because there really weren't any viable lists.
---
I think it was some 3/4 weapon created by \[\[Malkorok\]\]. He summoned a lovely 16/16 Jade Goldem. I hit him in the face to bring to 8 health, he conceded.

7/6/5 | Battlecry: Equip a random weapon.  
---
But shadow visions shows cave paintings of murlocs, not actual murlocs
---
That’s fair. But I would think that since grommash is in the classic set, they would’ve added a little something something to have that neat interaction to get lethal (or at least to deal some serious damage). Oh well.
---
That's rough, man.  Thoughts and prayers.
---
Well, won't he give you twisting nether on a big board?
---
So priest and warlock are the same class?🤔
---
Julan#21466 on EU looking to trade the quest.
---
I'll show mine and we will do yours first.
---
You could play casual or arena. The ladder is for playing the best deck you have.
---
Hmm.  Rastakhan's Rumble was 4 weeks after release, and Boomsday was similar if I remember right.
---
Rise of Shadows was 4-5 weeks as well if my memory serves, but this is looking like 7 weeks?  That's quite a while, especially when there is on average  16-17 weeks between expansions.
---
Pyros
---
Even worse it was back to back with a normal legendary
---
Isn't companion better though?
---
small indie company
---
I appreciate the correction, I did mean Even paladin. Glad we got the verbage correct. But I don't think you understood my point *at all* about BoS.
---
&gt;But woe if it were to exist in a meta like Kobolds, where it Summoner-style decks made \~27 minion decks were commonplace
---
I didn't say it didn't exist in the same meta as Spiteful, but it sure didn't exist in a mage deck because putting together a \~27 minion deck is - and was - a tough sell given the relative weakness of mage minions the last two standard years (Plus Pyroblast and Glacial Mysteries are far worse when drawn then MC/UI were for priest and druid Spiteful)
---
Point is that - since you presented powerful early card draw as a bad example of how Giants are a potentially limiting factor on design space - powerful early card draw *does* exist and happens to have gone to classes where it can't be taken advantage of to drop turn 3 Mountain Giants. I don't think that's a coincidence.
---
r/fuckdruid
---
You can get jaraxxus if you cheapen him to one mana with pocket galaxy and are low on health. My guess would be make him cost zero somehow with a big minion on board
---
Mirror Entity more like Mirror Enter the battlefield
---
yes but one of the two other options will usually be a Tyrion.
---
Sadly EDH in Hearthstone would never really work.
---
A card isn't considered played until all of its battlecries are resolved.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Take the card Snipe, for example, "After your opponent plays a minion (same as Mirror Entity), deal 4 damage to it."
---
Then play a card that summons another card.  Which one does snipe hit?  It hits the summoned card, because it is resolved on the field before the original card is.
---
But the wording still makes sense. Faceless is finished summoning after it transforms, hence why it copies the copy. Same with Blademaster, as part of its summoning involves it taking damage, so once it's finished taking damage then it gets copied. Don't know why this change would be made when Mirror Entity works rather well and it's fairly consistent in its effect.
---
Riveting gameplay
---
You need to create more then 2 copies of every card as e.g. rafaam can create more then only 1 copy of a legendary minion.
---
But nonetheless. It's awesome. Would love to have a good game of it.
---
&gt; Priest is actually good right now
---
... it is?
---
Isn't Don Hon Cho Pally/Warrior/Hunter only?
---
Which treasure is that?
---
As far as I know, every removal that costs less than 4 mana has been abused and subsequently nerfed in some way. Conjure's Calling has to be next.
---
Name a more iconic duo. I'll wait
---
it's +6
---
The wide board pulls are from minions such as annoytrons generated by shudderwock. And I usually do it as I have no other choice and would at least like to get all the battlecries out before they respond with shudderwock. The last 3 shudderwocks have been canned early due to brawls pulled mid sequence. No other spells. I dropped saboteur after that.

[[Blade Flurry]].  You'll need to have drawn as big of nuts as they did, but if you can have the quest complete &amp; equipped, Blade Flurry just wins you the game.
---
One of the greatest strengths of a control player is knowing the meta. You have to almost reflexively know what your opponent is likely to do on any given play and what they are capable of 1-2 plays in the future. 
---
If you can't accurately predict that, then you're going to make poor choices. Wasting removal too early or allowing certain boardstates to overwhelm you because you didn't address them correctly.
---
You can only really gain that knowledge by playing 100's of games or playing all of those decks and learning them.

Actually I didn't, I haven't been playing for very long and I seem to have reached a brick wall at rank 10, Thanks to people replying to this post Ive got a general idea on what I need to do, the link is more of a side note, if it offends you in some way I can take it down, my question was the main thing I wanted an answer to, although by tournament do you mean the arena? Or is it like the tavern brawl? Anyway thanks for the advice, if you do want me to remove the link I'm more than happy to
---
Hard countered!
---
You probably need to take this inside guac boi
---
Alt win co actually. I had really high cost spells in there in case basic win co is ruined
---
I challenge your 30 ogres with my 31 4 mana 7/7s
---
Probably.
---
New experiences with new interactions across expansions. That why I love wild. Like Kazakus and Zephrys running in the same deck or that 7 mana your next spell cost 0 mana if your deck has no dupes legendary for mage. You can pull out some nutty win-cons with some of these decks.
---
Do they balance the class around that combo? The article is super wrong about the reasons Priest don't have draw or other mechanics. It's not because Inner Fire exists, they even support it from time to time, it's because it's Priest identity and they are so commited to that shitty identity that they even HoF Mind Blast. Trust me, I don't like it either, but Priest needs that card to survive. Healing is definitely NOT a win condition, not even with the quest.
---
Not consistent with priest identity, deck limit reset to 2 after you queue up
---
How could you possibly lose with this tool of creation
---
Is kibbler a timmy?
---
Lol, I suck at arena so If I'm lucky I get 3 wins, The highest Ive ever gotten is like 5
---
I like the idea of adding a set of cards be it 10-12 each new expansion that are “rotated in” from old expansions. It could really add some diversity among the decks and the meta.
---
My Best run was 12-1 in rastakhan update and yesterday I had 11-3, but usually I get ~4 wins

Hey what decklist u using?
---
This expansion whizbang decks are pretty good, (at least ranks 50-20)
---
Why waste time with lot features when few features do trick?
---
🔪
---
Ok I'll do some googling on this, cause I'm not sure what you're talking about lol.
---
Did they say anything about rewards yet? Last time we got a golden leggy and 16 packs one of them golden, and im guessing there is no golden legendary this time
---
Nerfs more like Serfs
---
boom bam bop badabop boom pow
---
also where's my goddam tendies mom
---
No we don't know anything yet.

How did Puzzle Box summon all those minions?
---
Today I spend 7 mana of the 9 and my warrior Dr. Boom opponent had 10 health left. I played zephrys and it did not give me pyroblast. Dr. Boom did not have armour hero power. Does it think that he has armour hero power because it is a worrior? Other options were not lethal.
---
Or just a few Thalnoses and Moonfire their ass!
---
Ahhh ok, it's a card, but it look like the crafting cost is super high 1600 dust. Guess I'll be waiting a while for that one.
---
https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Whizbang_the_Wonderful
---
Whizbang is a card that you can craft for normal dust price but it will give you a random meta deck when you start the game.
---
You just pick Whizbang and one game you're playing a Rogue deck then, next game is Mage and so on...it'll just give you a random deck from a set list each time 
---
It's what people use when they don't have tons of dust or don't wanna use any dust.
---
30x boom to assert dominance
---
Sorry was eating while typing this.
---
He's a card you can craft and if you put him in a deck,  each round you will start with a random standard deck they change each expansion and are pretty decent at low ranks.
---
Remove Hearthstone from your device and then reinstall the game. As soon as you get the chance to interact with the options cogwheel, open it up and go to Asset Download. Then disable the asset bundle download from there. You won't download the golden animations for cards unless you specifically go back in and enable it. That won't solve all your problems, but it should help a little bit.
---
Here's a fun video on a few ways to beat 2500 armor Druid
---
What rank are you currently?
---
Hey that’s mine too! I opened a gold one on expansion day and it really looks awesome!
---
If you already have your collection there, just go to decks and sort by name.  That in effect sorts by the amount of dust it'd take to finish the decks, find a cheap and good deck and get climbing!
---
Just started, my border looks like wood I guess?
---
Probably, but the secret interaction quotes make it worth it.
---
I mean, hitting Sylvanas with it is great, but Mage already has even more degenerate stuff tbh.  Most of the time I’d take 2 giants over 2 random 6 drops (iirc the average statting of those is something like 4-5?) and a random enemy minion.
---
lol I actually have noob, made it with my murloc Shaman whipping mage last expansion
---
Poggossss
---
I would recommend swapping a prep for a gadgetzan auctioneer so you can occasionally highroll and show the enemy just how much better prepared you are than them. Could also maybe throw in a copy of Illidan so you can play him at the end to really rub it in.
---
You can check to see which cards are in the Hall of Fame set by going into your collection by filtering under "Hall of Fame"
---
The more common one is quest Mage, which might actually have a better MU there because it can go through Iceblock while exodia can fall to reno+any removal that clears out the specs.
---
Haha, didn't see it that way before.
---
His eyes are giving him out.
---
YOU ALL MAKE FUCKING EXCELLENT POINTS AND I FUCKING AGREE WITH ALL OF YOU
---
I do this but haven't played hearthstone in like 3 years lmao
---
You win SoM, you lose SoM.
---
I disagree, the card is so strong it was for the best to be near unplayable outside of very niche combo decks. Turn 4 Lunas can beat anything including what should be the decks worst matchups (aggro and tempo) before the buff conjures Mage was strong but not this broken thing. If
---
The turn 4 board isn’t really a thing in the normal version of the deck, it’s turn 5.  
---
It’s also a MASSIVE highroll to get it that early; you can’t talk about a decks power in only the best case, consistency matters.
---
GOLDEN ARMOUR
---
Hmm I doubt we'd see many 'double quest' decks other than for the memes.
---
Then the mage plays galaxy anyways and still wins lol
---
Considering the top deck in standard is still control warrior there's a healthy representation of slow decks
---
My point is that Zeph doesn’t say it pulls from the basic and classic set only. It doesn’t say it in the card text or the flavor text or anywhere in the game. To learn that, you have to go to hearthpwn or reddit or some other secondhand source.
---
Hello yes I am here to register a complaint. I did everything you said as far as I can tell but was offered Gorehowl, Ysera, and Loot Hoarder.
