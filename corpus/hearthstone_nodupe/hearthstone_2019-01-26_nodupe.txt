Don't look at that like as "evolve" mechanic, is a transform mechanic

hope you draw it first?

Baku face hunter, you pretty much win or lose by turn 4 so you can grind real quick
---
And 5 card packs! 
---
Preaching wat the whole community has begged for for ages now.. but wat do they do make u grind even less now... but for wat reward???
---
Man wild looks weird man
---
I’m rather glad we can be civil as well, so much simpler and makes me want to keep talking. We are discussing a game that does make bad decisions so it’s easy to respect and understand your point of view even if it differs from mine. 
---
I didn’t play during the unnerfed warsong days. I tried out hearthstone on its initial release and came back during old gods. So beyond some basic objective thoughts, I shouldn’t speak further on that beyond my understanding that frothing with charge was very bad. 
---
As far as nerfing extremes I will admit there do seem to be cards that are quite broken that they choose to ignore. They ignored patches and raza until rotation. It remains to be seen if they will follow suit with things like ultimate infestation and baku. 
---
This debate even furthers the fact that there is often little rhyme or reason to the changes beyond the whim at the moment (like mana wyrm). 
---
I try not to take hearthstone too seriously anymore. I don’t purchase sets anymore, I just save up gold and dust over the year to get cards and play mostly wild and a little standard. 
---
Eh, not quite. It's Guerilla Unit, but good try.  
---
The math checks out
---
So it took four years to pay off the loan you took out to buy enough hearthstone packs to get to this spot? right? RIGHT?
---

---
I do like your shinies tho.
---
RenoLock still heavily depends on tempo swings or massive plays, not necessarily good old value. Both Bloodreaver Gul'dan and N'Zoth, which are the deck's main win conditions and they're both tempo swings. Early wins often come from Voidcaller into some big Demon. Reno Jackson himself is also not a value card per se. Once again, it's a big swing, especially against Aggro.
---
If anything, Reno Mage is more of a value deck, but it's pretty bad right now. Frankly, the other two Reno decks are also only "okay" in Wild right now and I wouldn't classify either of them as a value deck.
---
Also the big "value" for me was exactly because you already owned them and that they can't ever procc as a golden from packs makes it worth it. It's a craft you'll never disenchant and never feel bad about should you open one in a pack in the future.
---
Nobody “invented” meta. You obviously have no idea how it actually works. Meta is simply what is the current trend or popular gameplay style. Nobody forces a meta with any degree of success. 
---
Ahh never got Knuckles, too late to craft now I think as well. Thanks
---
Big Priest player here, Odd Warrior can't possibly beat Big Priest as long as you have a brain. Bad players are probably going to lose though, it seems most guys go T4 Barnes T5 Resurrect T6 something T7 Spellstone, no joke.
---
And a money transfer
---
I've considered it lol but looking for some shenanigan type decks like yogg hunter. Thanks 
---
You are guaranteed a legendary card in the first 10 packs of each different set that you open, so make sure that happens to you with each set. Then yes, classic is the largest pool and never expires. 
---
Fun and interactive btw
---
In April, over 400 cards are removed from standard and 135 new ones are introduced. Nothing is hard to imagine. 
---
80g quest trade NA Symonator#1971.  Ill show, but you go first
---
Beast Druids and Pirate Rogues dominating Casual.  Wtf?
---
Congrats.  Nice game, but the volume was way too loud.
---
You want cast a spell?
---
Feelsbadman , i already spend like 5000+ dust since rastakhan went live to play with the fun deck.
---
I do hope they will adjust the dust rate a bit, when i open 130+ packs nearly every expansion, the extra dust i gain from extra card is roughly about 500-1000 dust, which is only enough for 1-2 epic. 
---
Maybe adjust epic card dust value? It feels shitty when you can open multiple copies of the same card and then need 4 of it just to craft a new one. 
---
Anyway i tried discard warlock and crafted few epics and legendaries for it when rastakhan arrived, haven't touch it for few weeks now, wish i used that dust for experimenting with something else, too bad the disenchanting value is too horrible.
---
Sorry about that it was my first time recording on my new phone.
---
Ya but to be fair I was using a pretty trash bloodreaver deck until recently. Only need like 1 to 2 thousand dust for secret hunter though. Which is better, secret or spell hunter? 
---
consider yourself lucky you haven't faced my dinomancy crouching tiger hidden dragon deck at rank 20 yet
---
You can never get Barnes in a pack. He's from the One Night in Karazan Adventure. So getting all the legendaries in the set doesn't matter. The guy above you was making a joke. 
---
I have a Golden Lakkari Sacrifice that I was trying to make work for like forever. I also got stuff like Blood Queen Lanathel and other epics for Discard Warlock. 
---
I gave up this expansion when I realize I woudl have to craft *additional legendaries and epics* to make a deck that isn´t even really good. 
---
And people wonder why we get tired of experimenting.
---
Well I don't have a problem with either card as it also makes it easier to play around what cards they don't have. 
---
i make anti meta decks and stomp the sheeps, lol, it's very pleasurable
---
Holy shit you're loaded
---
Starting April 2020 they will be playable in wild only, no longer in standard. 
---
True that, but what cards they dont have will result in synergy of cards they have with the improved/discounted hero power
---
What? Just don’t double your deck and you can easily Reno over and over.
---
You have to get that dust somehow to craft so opening the packs of the expansion you want to craft cards for is better since there is a chance, no matter how small, that you will unpack the cards you want to craft.
---
Adventures should definitely be there. I enjoyed them and it's sad that new player can't even thought the are making the game larger for the player.
---
Lol ftp my ass
---
But if they had 30 health and 48 armor (78 effective) and took a 128 hit that would be 50 overkill, yet we see 65 overkill, which is what we would expect if their health was 15 less, or 15 health plus 48 armor.
---
Unless I'm missing something, your maths is not fine.
---
I mean I didn't calculate myself yet if opponent was at 30 or 15 before you hit. Quickly glansed over it.

You can’t really compare hearthstone to csgo/overwatch. Skins don’t contribute to how or what you play in those games contrary to hearthstone where what and how you play is directly related to what cards you have.

Why don’t you make an account for your kids and play against them
---
It‘s funny how people reduce HS to Ranked, when Arena is an actual really good format since the bucket system was introduced.  
---
The fact that Arena is not being pushed as another major tournament format blow my mind, Blizzard might want to look at MTG when it comes to non-constructed formats and how well they go in tournaments. 
---
Pretty much any card that makes other cards is a solid gold craft. Or at least don’t dust it. 
---
Dota chess is superior 
---
r/theydidthemonstermath
---
yeah but auto chess is really good
---
I’ve never watched a Thijs stream and didn’t smile. He’s a genuinely nice and funny guy. Less than three!
---
I'm curious on how this holds up in the traditional sense.  There are people who devote 30+ years of sports and then go on to coach the same sport.  Why does it seem so lack luster in sports. 
---
lmao thats quite unfortunate haha, currently wrecking bosses in this run
---
Look's pretty good!
---
A thing called candy. In the game your avatar is a courier and you can get different skins for it. It costs 40 candy to roll for a random new skin. You get candy for placing top 3 in a game based on how many eliminations you had. But also you can only get 10 per day. You can buy codes for candy on eBay from the creators to try and get that sick courier you want. 
---
I fucking LOL’d hard at this; what song is that? Shit slaps 
---
Read this guy’s comment history before taking him seriously.
---
It's very unlikely that Blizzard will install a trading feature.  
---
Since a collector would want the golden version in their account not on a separate account that's missing most cards, it's probably not worth anything. 
---
Fake news, OP.
---
You can pay for some premium content in custom games, usually cosmetics and a leaderboard. Dunno if auto-chess has it.
---
Also hafu and kripp played were playing it. 
---
People are allowed to play what they want, when they want, regardless of how you feel about it.
---
That’s how you become the meta
---
I use 2x Galvanizer + 2x Youthful Brewmaster to reduce it's cost by 4, and then use Frost Bolt + Snap Freeze(or 2x Snap Freeze) to kill off the 6 mana Mecha'thun.
---
"The streamers are playing chess, whilst everyone here is playing checkers."
---
...Chess being magic &amp; checkers being HS
---
Godfrey sees play in any type of control warlock, in wild too. Soularium sees some play in zoo and discardlock, if you are interested in that. It seems to be rarely played in wild mecha'thun warlock.
---
They are both rotating at the same time, around april of 2020. 
---
Really?! Awesome! I've been wanting to get back into the game for a while, but potentially losing the ability to get certain cards always drove me away.
---
Second question: do wild card packs come back for purchase, or are they just gone for good?
---
Diablo Immortal surely isn't helping either...
---
&gt;1/1 a new minion that gains the text box of the minion selected
---
I'm honestly not sure this is trivial to do in the HS client.  We've never seen anything like that, where a summoned minion gains new stats.  At least, I don't believe so.
---
Why dota?
---
You can craft any card, you just have to swap to wild mode. Also if wild mode is your thing you can still buy wild packs but only for real money in the blizzard store.
---
Toast also LoL
---
I play both meta and off-meta decks and i'm mostly matched against other meta stuff playing either of them.

How are you going to get a turn 4 Yshaarj without Barnes involved?
---
And my bow! 
---
Nice, thanks man, you answered my second question, too!
---
I started playing over 2 years ago. It was probably the 3rd or 4th pack I opened... Golden Hogger, Doom of Elwynn. I was so fresh to Hearthstone that I didn’t realize the significance. But I put that fucker in every damn deck I made. 
---
RIP, good buddy.
---
lol, grumble is cancer. Shudderwock was meme tier 1 
---
it's a dota 2 mode. it's like the mix of hearthstone arena and dota. it's 8 player game where each player gets offered 5 heroes each turn and try to make a good compositions with them. Then they fight each other automatically. you get gold and can buy new heroes, refresh the offered heroes or buy another hero slot with the gold. getting 3 of the same hero upgrades it. they have synergies and stuff like warriors, warlocks etc. and it's the most addicting shit i have ever played.
---
Wait is Auto chess an actual game or is this sarcasm?
---
Actually the opposite. They never did sponsored streams until recently - game blew up on its own so early in to twitch before sponsored streams were as big of a thing. 
---
it's a dota 2 custom mode. it has become very popular very quick.
---
no carry over, always starts as if you had lost your last game prior to the reset.
---
For those who don't understand - it shows a skull on his minion when he is targeting the enemy hero, which means it would die after that attack.
---
Go ahead, it's only 20 dust.
---
Honestly, hard to say with the rotation out of Rexxar but I feel like Zul'jin is potentially more powerful than Rexxar in terms of an aggro deck. That you can play Rexxar in the same deck currently though and get the huge boost from Zul'jin swapped into the sustain from Rexxar is kinda ridiculous.
---
Everyone in this subreddit 
---
Oh no. All of them switched to Dota Auto Chess
---
“Even Playboy photographers don’t want to goto work on Monday”
---
Maybe upload your collection on hsreplay.net or hearthpwn.com and make it public, then you can get some better advice what kind of decks you should be making?
---
I mean yeah if you are consistently going worse than 3-3, yeah you are a shit arena player by definition.
---
no idea what this shit is since its not english 
---
It's alright, I once played Wax Rager against her (lost the game pretty quickly from there). Turns out she has a few special voice lines for it. 
---
Don’t forget Hafu as well lmao 
---
Godfrey will probably see enough play during the next standard year, so he's probably a safe craft. Soularium is not needed for Mecha'Thun Warlock, just replace it with another piece of cycle like an Engineer. It's not even clear if Soularium actually raises the winrate of the deck.
---
Ok i will
---
Good try but nope. It’s a game mode in Dota.
---
I did the same thing but with double deathrattle, it just turned into 7 wax ragers going face every turn.
---
Yes. So it's still 5 Scrolls from one draw, but there was a non-Scroll card drawn in the middle of the sequence, so the 5 scrolls weren't technically "in a row."
---
You have to double reno+at least one deadman's guaranteed, and this would force you to play all of the other cards in your hand first, or you wouldn't get the cards you want quickly, meaning Reno is on an X turn timer. It's really hard to play that properly, even for some legend players. OP is playing casual, so probably not Legend.
---
They had had 48 armour and 30 health. I played Alexstrasza and reduced them to 15 health. Then they played a 9 mana minion. I then hit back with the 4x buff. But is maths really the point of this post? Lol
---
That's not a secret he has said that tons of times. Obviously kripp gives his input and instructions since he knows the game better but they are definitely a team
---
All different guys? I don't believe you.
---
Trollolol.  Keep lying to strangers on the internet, bro.  It really makes you seem like a well adjusted person when you do.
---
ah check, didnt saw that thought there where 2 flares going off
---
You are on this legend rank but we do not grant you a legendary 
---
Take nat pagle with you. Had it for 20 turns on board and drew me exactly one card. Pretty sure when they nerfed it, they brought the past bug back where it was not 50%.
---
I know cheers, just clarifying for those who don’t know how Alexstrasza works. 
---
Druid also has cthun
---
Would be fun if they played acctuall dota.
---
"WTF, that enemy Sky killed me in less than 2 secounds."

How many cards did you have in your hand?
---
How good pesky rascal was? 
---
Streamers will return to HS when the rotation happens in a few months. The meta's a little stale now.
---
Also Auto chess is super fun
---
Started out Rocky and a little expensive if you didn't want to draft but it's pretty cheap now. It might become popular when it's first expansion gets released. (Apparently the dev said they left some core mechanics for the expansion in an attempt to not overwhelm people too much.)

So this is how hearthstone dies, with thunderous applause.
---
It will largely depend on the upcoming expansion, but Odd Warrior's weaknesses are too easy to abuse to see it ever becoming the top deck. If there's any common denominator between previous top decks, it's that they're pretty difficult to counter.
---
I know it might sound like I suck but I never played consistently on ranked because I got overwhelmed by the meta. I always played for fun but never got to experience the ranked experience because I had other games to play. So I kinda understand your thoughts about it.

I've been playing HS since vanilla.  This current meta is one of the most.... how do i put this..... yawn worthy, boring, uninteresting.  It's not a BAD meta, it's not like the days of jade druid pirate warrior or undertaker dominance where it felt so terrible to play.  It's just.... boring.  Honestly when I do boot up the game to play, i try to just whip through my quests as quick as I can then i jump into some pve rumble for a bit.
---
There's a saying that the opposite of love isn't hate, it's apathy.  I think right now a lot of people are just feeling very apathetic about hearthstone.
---
This is an underrated post. The problem is that it’s hard to have a video game that people play forever. So many games come out every year, after a while it’s easy to move on to something else. These guys started playing almost 6 years ago. I would pull my hair out if I had to play the same game all day every day for 6 years.
---
The classic reynad one-two
---
Ya I see people doing that in arena all the time even when playing against mage. Even ignoring the potential counterspell or mana bind or the possibility of you getting a random combo card the psychological factor is reason enough to keep it. I might play around hex or lightning storm which I otherwise wouldn’t if you got a spell from cauldron ie

I only really use the heroic Blackrock one because I worked my arse off for that. Actually broke my keyboard while trying so it cost me something 
---
I started playing hearthstone middle of the witchwood expansionary still motivated. Just because you older players quit dosnt mean the game is dying 
---
Hilarious hahahaha
---
I remember that deck.  Strifecro held the record for most wins in a row for a long time with that deck.  It wasn’t ever on the same power level as current Baku Paladin.  Strife was an incredibly good player, started playing the deck in lower ranks, and the expansion hadn’t been out long enough for the meta to settle in.
---
That deck was out at the same time as arcane golem face hunter, hand lock, and FoN/Roar Druid.  And there were never complaints about Quartermaster being OP.
---
CS has seen relatively few changes for nearly 20 years and is still going strong. People even play the same maps today(with minor changes) that they did back then. Then again CS is a lot more complex and interactive than HS.

Only help players who already have decent collection? No, lol.
---
There are plenty of people who have 1-2 meta decks and could get to legend and they'd greatly benefit from it. You don't need a full collection for that. Collection-wise you can get legend with 1~2 month of playing the game, even less if you know what you're doing. Specially with so many cheap decks. For fuck's sake, you can build a midrange hunter deck for 3k dust.
---
People can't get legend because they're bad (and sometimes time), not because they don't have cards - that only goes for players who JUST started.

Why my pp hard

Especially you gregorio02. Don't act like you weren't there all along.
---
I’m pretty sure I know what to do, i watch enough yt guide or streams to know pretty much every card in the game. But if the enemy Hunter Plays his Spellstone on Curve and I play Priest, tell me which card should I play to clear the board without Duskbreaker or Mass Hysteria, which I just don’t own. Hearthstone is all about budget dude

According to someone from Taiwan, when they did the ghosting , they didn't know it was wrong to do so and also apparently , blizzard didn't translated that part of the rule there.

I love the emotes. Everything is so innocuous that everything cuts like a knife.

That's what happens when a small indie company makes a game with Unity.
---
I'm really surprised no one compared Trogg Elder to [[Eternal Sentinel]]. I understand the difference is that if you don't have 2 normal mana crystals to use you can't play the Sentinel at all but aside from that this card seems to me to be much weaker.

Year of the Raven absolutely did have something to do with The Witchwood expansion. Moreso than the other two expansions.
---
And the pig is a curious choice for OW, there's also a datamined flying pig mount in WoW.
---
Maybe they could do an expansion about the [Hogchoppers](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Tanaris_Hogchopper), a totally real, existing group.
---
At the beginning and the end, there seem to be more aggro decks, so good control decks work well. In the middle there seem to be more weird combo decks.
---
I started my collection by “buying” Classic packs until I had all of the Commons and about 80% of the Rares (arbitrary number but that’s around where I felt almost every pack gave me only cards I already had).  The reason I did this is because of what you say, that Classic cards never rotate, and the power level of Classic is pretty high and the cards commonly used.  If I had to do it again, it’s also exactly what I would do again.
---
However the expansions from 2018 won’t rotate until 2020 so those are very safe as well — over a year is a very long time.  If you don’t know, the first ten packs you get of a set guarantee you a Legendary, so getting those first (up to) ten packs from each set, probably also including the rotating ones, is the best allocation of your resources.  After that I would recommend going for Classic, then the most recent year’s expansions, but ultimately that’s more of a preference.

I like the combo of necrotic Geist + houndmaster shaw, as long as you have 1 sacrificial minion.
---
If the enemy’s has a large board, I call it “zombie infinity” every time you rush in your zombie to die another on spawns and repeat the process, you can clear an entire board of ancient ones if you had too.

I was going to point that out

This  is not constructed, is it?

I see no problems with this.

---
That’s unfortunate, I hope you still enjoy the game. Personally I like Rastakhan bc the theme is just great and the cards are really cool. Even if they’re not op lol 
---
Yeah, the +3/+3's usefulness is debatable and reducing the cost of cards in your deck sounds more useful. What I really love about the battlecry is the cost for that though. It's wonderfully unique.
---
This requires emergency measures, better post dog pictures on blog ASAP

Oh I just checked deck the July changes from last year and deck to hand retains enchantments. Cool I thought it was from zone to zone.

Neat!

It must be the laptop and whatever builtin video card you're using.  HS on my pc uses 6-10% of my cpu and like 15-25% of my CPU.  Ram usage is 380-500megs of memory..

That definitely was the hardest part was grinding out matches.

And thats a good winrate, what is the highest you've hit so far?
---
thank you, very satisfying to see.
---
You play by making builds and forming an army of sorts. The pieces you buy are Dota heroes. All these heroes have varying stats, abilities and traits. 
---
Its hard to explain without showing. I recommend Trumps video. In the first 5 minutes you will understand what there is to play and how everything kind of works:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3WpwnXbaCM
---
The depth of the game comes in that you are playing vs 7 other people all making their own unique army. You have to constantly react to how your opponent is building their army and you have to organize your economy. It looks very simple but there is quite a lot going on. And the devs are constantly updating the game so you can constantly come back for newer pieces and balance changes.
---
I wish card backs were actually good.
---
When did I ever defend Big Priest? All I did was showing how Barnes pales in comparison to NSW decks. NSW was Barnes on crack and it didn’t even need as much of a highroll to pull it off like Barnes does. 
---
The thing about wild nerfs is, the two times wild was directly nerfed (Aviana and Naga Sea Witch), was a result of both decks being way more broken than Barnes highroll, warping literally the whole meta around them, and happening way more consistently around a similar turn as Barnes. 
---
My point is, if we want to convince Blizzard and other people that Barnes should be nerfed, this isn’t the way to go. There are plenty of good arguments that we’ve been circlejerking for the past 2 years; use those.
---
What do you mean achievement. It's a mental challenge. 
---
Odd mage is pretty good vs any hunter
---
I was a rank 1 player in classic/nax, never made the push to legend back then, but that being said it was a lot harder to grind the stars back then from what I remember.
---
Nowadays I hover around 10-7, hit 6 this season but quickly found myself back at 10 when I switched from odd pala to control priest
---
Rainmaker#2730 EU trading 80g Quest
---
&gt; I said half of them i.e. midrange druid and freeze mage. Sheesh.
---
Midrange druid and freeze mage are not OTK decks.
---
&gt; All the otk decks you listed also require setup? You literally need to cycle through your entire deck with mechathun and apm priest to a lesser extent, fight for board while trying to draw your combo pieces with shudder.
---
Okay, but when I said 'setup', in this case I meant you had to set up something that your opponent could interact with. Druid had a lot of burst, but they had to stick minions on the board or get the enemy's health down in advance in order to be able to finish them off. Freeze mage did not have a 30 damage OTK, which meant that Priests could heal out of range and warriors could armor out of range.
---
With mechathun, apm priest, OTK paladin, shudderwock, and ressurect priest, there is no counterplay. There is no way to interact with your opponents combo. You either kill them ahead of time, or you lose - so control decks literally just can't exist in the meta.
---
pufferfish#1234 NAtrading 80g quest, happy to go first if you show. Would prefer wild games if possible.

But did you take candle?

Great job my man, I finished my runs last month and the accomplishment feels huge after so much rng bull lol
---
Does everyone have a shitty computer or something? I've seen posts like these but can't relate at all. Ive tried hearthstone on 2 other computers so far, including a touch screen PC that was not meant for gaming, and it worked just fine.
---
Yeah I don't know why you would ever use them in the same deck, it'd be like using [[Bomb Squad]] with either [[Da Undatakah]] or [[N'Zoth]]
---
Odd Paladin is the best deck all round to beat all hunter archtypes.  
---
Secret and spell hunter are really different now (secret is effectively the hybrid midrange deck) so what can beat one may not beat the other.
---
People need to stop this thinking of "1 deck to beat hunter" as the top 3 hunter decks now play totally differently and with different decks and archtypes there is no "beat them all" usually though odd paladin is the only deck that will get good results vs all 3.

But when you do of it's a beautiful thing heh.  More dire frenzied beasts into deck and draw 1 immediately from masters call.

I even misplayed once and the ire frenzy went to an opponents beast (oops) but that still got shuffled into my deck and drawn to still give me the win with good ole tundra rhino.  
---
I really enjoy playing this deck

I can't reproduce this at all. I just tried it out. In a game of Hearthstone:

14% CPU, 14% GPU, 385 MB of RAM
---
Just in the practice range in Overwatch:

18% CPU, 70% GPU, 2150 MB of RAM7
---
I figured there wouldn't be a lot of people who cared. I was just curious if anyone else had thought of it. 
---
Keening banshee is good in arena. Whenever you mill cards, just think that they were at the bottom of the deck and you weren’t gonna draw them.

4/-/- | Shuffle 10 cards from your opponent's class into your deck. They cost (1).  
---
I'd choose zilliax, it's probably the safest choice, cairne and black knight are greedier. 
---
Hero cards aren’t bad by default just not always well balanced, 20 turns of never ending huge lifesteal rush minions is never going to be fun to play against for instance. 
---
All I’m saying is that hero cards should be about getting an interesting game altering hero power where the battlecry is a tool to make sure that the card isn’t too low tempo. Hero cards shouldn’t be spells with a gimmick hero power and some armour taped on the side, eg zul’jin and this card above.
---
Tfw Dragon Roar is still in the third bucket
---
My deck could potentially be very greedy with the Mind Control and cause its so early in the draft. I was leaning more towards zilliax tho too.
---

---
it's conciderably above average
---
Interesting.. i get that it offers slightly better stats, ive only recently started trying to get into arena after a long time of ladder.. ill consider it better next time
---
I see a lot of people picking hyldnir aswell.. i would have thought the loss in choosing trades is often worse than gaining an extra health stat point but ill pearn as i go
---
I just always felt like banshee was a riddiculous card :)
---
Hopefully you hit 'em with the "Greetings" or "Thanks" before popping off. 
---
I love how people still underrate this card.

Gives me so many wins just because they ignore it and go face and then get smashed 2 or 3 turns later.
